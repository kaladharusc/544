A regular teddy bear

18
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,960
Ian: Yeah, that's perfect. There's no declarations of love. Yeah, that's perfect Thanks

19
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,320
Salesman :Go get her tiger

Ian : Oh..

29
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,700
Ian:  didn't know that it talked ...awkward

30
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:37,700
Teddy : And if you didn't love me too i'd kill myself *Ian coughs*

31
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,320

32

Noah: Well, you know I thought I'd pick up a couple roses pick apart

38
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:56,880
They're decaying carcasses and spread them around the house in hopes that you would sleep with me.

39
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,940
Courtney: Huh.. well

40
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:07,240
I don't know why I'm interpreting these actions as a romantic gesture instead of something a complete psychopath would do but I gotta admit

41
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:11,400
I'm pretty horny right now

42
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,920

Manny: Yo, why are there flowers on the table

49
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,800
Danny: Oh, dad bought them for mom

50
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,700
Manny: Wait a minute

51
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,200
Danny what day is it?

52
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:41,000

53
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,680
Danny: Oh my god

56
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,440
Mom: Hey no leaving the house past sundown

57
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:58,200
Danny: She's talking to us!, while she's doing it

58
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:03,240
Why couldn't they just wait till we were asleep

59
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,260
Random Guy: Who bought me flowers. Shane: I did for myself

60
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:09,160
Teddy: The way I would kill myself is with a knife.

61
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,860
And the way i'd kill you is with the same knife.

62
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:18,920
Ian: Okay, maybe if you just press them again, it'll say something not so crazy.

63
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:24,880
Teddy: The blood from my body would then mix with the blood from your body, which would bind our souls for eternity.

64
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,320
Ian: Son of a bitch.

65
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,460
Shane: Let's touch butts!  Ian: YEAH!!

66
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:32,200
*Laughing*

67
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,200
Courtney: Tonight was SO perfect

68
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,980
Shayne: Delicious and expensive thick hearty steak

69
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:45,760
Courtney: More than enough red wine Shane: And then a whole box of those heart-shaped chocolates filled with I don't even know

70
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:51,240
Courtney: And now we can engage an entire night of rigorous and passionate lovemaking

71
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,850
Shayne: mm-hmm

72
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:59,140

75
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,920
*courtney ALSO falls asleep*

76
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:15,360
Happy Valentine's Day yeah, we're good singers.

77
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,800
Courtney: Happy Valentine's Day. *animu gasp* goodbye

78
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,300

Teddy: If i found out you didn't love me

86
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:03,200
And I didn't have a knife nearby I'd kill myself with two guns Ian: okay, maybe just stop pressing it

87
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,820
I'd put both of them to my head and pull the triggers at the same time

88
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:13,260
The bullets would hit Each other and fuse together in my brain just like you and me should fuse together forever. Ian: Okay, Jesus. I can return it okay?

89
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:18,880
