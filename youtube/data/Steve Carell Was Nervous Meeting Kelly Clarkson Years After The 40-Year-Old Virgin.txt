2
00:00:01,334 --> 00:00:02,334
-How's it going up
on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;?

3
00:00:02,334 --> 00:00:03,334
-It's going well.
-Yeah?

4
00:00:03,334 --> 00:00:04,434
-It's fun.
Yeah, it's crazy.

5
00:00:04,434 --> 00:00:05,834
-Yeah.
Do you miss doing that?

6
00:00:05,834 --> 00:00:07,400
'Cause I know you kind of
got your start at,

7
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,234
like, Second City, right?
-Yeah, it's fun.

8
00:00:09,234 --> 00:00:12,801
It's -- You know, it's like
a different thing completely,

9
00:00:12,801 --> 00:00:14,667
but it's really exciting.

10
00:00:14,667 --> 00:00:16,634
-This is the third --
-Third time, yeah.

11
00:00:16,634 --> 00:00:18,734
I haven't hosted in 10 years.
-Is that right?

12
00:00:18,734 --> 00:00:20,033
-Yeah.
-Oh, my gosh.

13
00:00:20,033 --> 00:00:21,434
I cannot wait.
-Me too.

14
00:00:21,434 --> 00:00:23,100
-Congrats on the cover
of the magazine.

15
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,334
You're always
looking sharp there.

16
00:00:24,334 --> 00:00:25,968
Look at that. Come on.
[ Cheers and applause ]

17
00:00:25,968 --> 00:00:28,400
That's a stud right there.

18
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,801
Do you like --
Do you like doing photo shoots?

19
00:00:30,801 --> 00:00:32,801
-Oh, I love it!
I love it so much.

20
00:00:32,801 --> 00:00:35,667
[ Laughter ]

21
00:00:35,667 --> 00:00:37,667
It's where
I feel my most natural, yeah.

22
00:00:37,667 --> 00:00:39,133
-You think so?

23
00:00:39,133 --> 00:00:41,133
-Sit back
and put your hands here.

24
00:00:41,133 --> 00:00:42,767
[ Laughter ]
-It is really -- yeah.

25
00:00:42,767 --> 00:00:43,834
-Yeah.

26
00:00:43,834 --> 00:00:45,300
-I mean,
it's a beautiful photograph.

27
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,467
-It's a beautiful man.
[ Laughter and applause ]

28
00:00:47,467 --> 00:00:49,667
-Yeah, that's you.
That's you.

29
00:00:49,667 --> 00:00:51,400
This is a good one, here,
like casual hanging out

30
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,567
with your buddy.
-That is my manager.

31
00:00:53,567 --> 00:00:56,901
Who did not know -- that's my
actual manager who did not know.

32
00:00:56,901 --> 00:00:59,400
And the photographer said,
&quot;Oh, I like your look.&quot;

33
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,501
[ Laughter ]

34
00:01:00,501 --> 00:01:01,934
-Yeah, he does have a good look.
-Yeah.

35
00:01:01,934 --> 00:01:03,067
-Yeah, he should
get the cover, too.

36
00:01:03,067 --> 00:01:05,868
Ooh, look at this.
Look at this look.

37
00:01:05,868 --> 00:01:07,000
[ Cheers ]

38
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,601
Sauvage. Yeah.

39
00:01:09,601 --> 00:01:11,601
[ Laughter ]

40
00:01:11,601 --> 00:01:12,934
-I was up for Sauvage.

41
00:01:12,934 --> 00:01:14,133
-Oh, you were really?
-Yeah.

42
00:01:14,133 --> 00:01:15,667
Would you like
to see my Sauvage face?

43
00:01:15,667 --> 00:01:17,501
-Yeah. Let's see --
[ Laughter ]

44
00:01:17,501 --> 00:01:19,734
Oh, my God.

45
00:01:19,734 --> 00:01:22,133
Here's my --
[ Laughter ]

46
00:01:22,133 --> 00:01:23,467
Can we zoom in on that?
Did we get the Sauvage face?

47
00:01:23,467 --> 00:01:26,133
-Oh, I need to be looking off.
-Yeah.

48
00:01:26,133 --> 00:01:27,200
[ Laughter ]

49
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,601
That's a beautiful S--
-Thank you.

50
00:01:28,601 --> 00:01:29,767
-Do you want
to see my Sauvage face?

51
00:01:29,767 --> 00:01:33,000
-Yes.

52
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,634
[ Laughter ]

53
00:01:36,634 --> 00:01:38,334
I don't know if that's Sauvage.

54
00:01:38,334 --> 00:01:40,000
[ Laughter ]
It might be --

55
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,267
-That's what they said, as well.

56
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:43,501
[ Laughter ]

57
00:01:43,501 --> 00:01:45,634
They go, &quot;Uh,
I don't think that's Sauvage.&quot;

58
00:01:45,634 --> 00:01:46,767
-That's not so much Sauvage.

59
00:01:46,767 --> 00:01:48,801
-And they Sauvaged
me out the door.

60
00:01:48,801 --> 00:01:49,834
[ Laughter ]

61
00:01:49,834 --> 00:01:53,801
-Eau pas de Sauvage.
-Eau pas de Sauvage, yeah.

62
00:01:53,801 --> 00:01:56,801
I can't believe --
I saw this on your Twitter,

63
00:01:56,801 --> 00:01:59,434
and I'm so happy this happened.

64
00:01:59,434 --> 00:02:02,133
You just wrote, &quot;Finally,&quot;
and it's you and Kelly Clarkson.

65
00:02:02,133 --> 00:02:03,234
-Yeah.
[ Laughter and applause ]

66
00:02:03,234 --> 00:02:04,968
And that made me laugh.
-Man.

67
00:02:04,968 --> 00:02:07,868
-That was great.
-She is awesome.

68
00:02:07,868 --> 00:02:10,000
-I love Ke-- But I mean --
-She's the best.

69
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,200
-You had never
met Kelly Clarkson?

70
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,133
-No.
And my wife and I saw her.

71
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:16,767
I don't know what this --
It was some awards thing.

72
00:02:16,767 --> 00:02:18,300
And my wife said,
&quot;There she is!&quot;

73
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:18,834
And we had to go over,

74
00:02:18,834 --> 00:02:21,667
and we kind of accosted her
and said, &quot;Hi. We've never met,

75
00:02:21,667 --> 00:02:23,167
but I really wanted
to introduce myself.&quot;

76
00:02:23,167 --> 00:02:24,300
She could not have been nicer.

77
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,033
-She is the best.
She's so good.

78
00:02:26,033 --> 00:02:27,934
But I mean,
&quot;40-Year-Old Virgin,&quot;

79
00:02:27,934 --> 00:02:29,734
that's the thing you -- when you
were getting your chest waxed,

80
00:02:29,734 --> 00:02:31,567
you screamed, &quot;Kelly Clarkson!&quot;
-Right.

81
00:02:31,567 --> 00:02:32,601
[ Laughter ]

82
00:02:32,601 --> 00:02:35,267
-Well, I thought -- I thought
she'd be mad at me about that.

83
00:02:35,267 --> 00:02:36,601
-Yeah.
-You know, I wasn't sure,

84
00:02:36,601 --> 00:02:39,667
'cause I'd never
met her over those years.

85
00:02:39,667 --> 00:02:40,901
And I --
[ Laughter ]

86
00:02:40,901 --> 00:02:42,767
-Why did you say it?
-I don't know.

87
00:02:42,767 --> 00:02:45,033
-Yeah. I don't know.
-Like, &quot;Is he making fun of me?

88
00:02:45,033 --> 00:02:46,667
Like, why would
he say that in anguish?&quot;

89
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,734
-Right, sure.
-And, you know...

90
00:02:48,734 --> 00:02:50,634
-It was just something
that was on your mind.

91
00:02:50,634 --> 00:02:53,067
-Incidentally,
I love Kelly Clarkson.

92
00:02:53,067 --> 00:02:55,467
-Yeah.
-I'm a big fan to begin with.

93
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:56,634
And that's part of the reason --

94
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:58,501
-Do people yell
that to you when they see you?

95
00:02:58,501 --> 00:02:59,734
-Sometimes, yeah.

96
00:02:59,734 --> 00:03:00,801
[ Laughter ]

97
00:03:00,801 --> 00:03:02,067
-&quot;Steve, hey!&quot;
-&quot;Kelly Clarkson!&quot;

98
00:03:02,067 --> 00:03:05,834
-&quot;Clarkson! Aah!&quot;
-&quot;Kelly Clark-- you know...&quot;

[ Both shouting ]

00:03:08,367 --> 00:03:09,801
-Hey! Steve!

101
00:03:09,801 --> 00:03:11,267
-&quot;That's what she said!
Bleh!&quot;

102
00:03:11,267 --> 00:03:13,801
[ Laughter ]

103
00:03:13,801 --> 00:03:17,234
-Why would they say that to you?
-I don't know.

104
00:03:17,234 --> 00:03:18,934
-I want to talk about
&quot;Welcome to Marwen,&quot;

105
00:03:18,934 --> 00:03:22,100
because the story itself
is fascinating.

106
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,400
It's based on a true story.

107
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,167
-It is.
-And Robert Zemeckis.

108
00:03:25,167 --> 00:03:26,801
How cool is Robert Zemeckis?
-Really cool.

109
00:03:26,801 --> 00:03:28,901
-He's one of my favorites.
I mean, everyone's.

110
00:03:28,901 --> 00:03:32,501
But I mean, &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;...
-&quot;Cast Away.&quot;

111
00:03:32,501 --> 00:03:33,634
-&quot;Back to the Future.&quot;
-&quot;Back to the Future&quot;, yeah.

112
00:03:33,634 --> 00:03:36,133
-Just a genius, and
he just seems like the most --

113
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:38,534
He's just got
an eye for just fun.

114
00:03:38,534 --> 00:03:40,000
-Yeah, he's a big brain
walking around.

115
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,234
-He really is, right?

116
00:03:41,234 --> 00:03:43,400
How did you get hooked up
with him in this movie?

117
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,934
-I saw the documentary,
and I loved it.

118
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,667
It's a story about a guy

119
00:03:47,667 --> 00:03:50,234
who suffers
a really traumatic beating

120
00:03:50,234 --> 00:03:54,133
and has some brain damage,
and his insurance runs out.

121
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:57,200
And one of the methods that
he uses to cope, and as therapy,

122
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,300
he creates a World War II town

123
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,567
in his backyard
populated by dolls.

124
00:04:04,567 --> 00:04:06,701
You know, Barbies, essentially,
and G.I. Joes.

125
00:04:06,701 --> 00:04:07,934
-And G.I. Joes, yeah.

126
00:04:07,934 --> 00:04:10,801
-And he puts himself in there
as an alter ego,

127
00:04:10,801 --> 00:04:13,834
and he's able to kind of work
through a lot of his own trauma

128
00:04:13,834 --> 00:04:15,334
while taking pictures.

129
00:04:15,334 --> 00:04:17,534
He's an artist, and he takes
pictures of this town.

130
00:04:17,534 --> 00:04:18,934
It's a really fascinating story.

131
00:04:18,934 --> 00:04:21,234
-When you see these photos,
it looks like a real --

132
00:04:21,234 --> 00:04:24,033
It looks real.
-He's a lovely, lovely guy.

133
00:04:24,033 --> 00:04:27,834
I mean, he's just somebody
who completely lacking cynicism.

134
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:29,801
Just really earnest,
lovely person.

135
00:04:29,801 --> 00:04:32,934
-But the CGI, I gotta say,
the effects in this movie --

136
00:04:32,934 --> 00:04:34,234
you've never
seen a movie like this.

137
00:04:34,234 --> 00:04:35,701
-It's pretty crazy, yeah.
-It's magical.

138
00:04:35,701 --> 00:04:37,767
It is so cool.
-Thanks.

139
00:04:37,767 --> 00:04:39,100
-How did you --

140
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,100
How do you even act
when everything is CGI?

141
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,300
-Well, yeah, that motion-capture
stuff is weird.

142
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:47,133
'Cause you're walking around
in a gray jump suit

143
00:04:47,133 --> 00:04:48,667
that is not a flattering thing.

144
00:04:48,667 --> 00:04:49,734
[ Laughter ]
You know, you're just --

145
00:04:49,734 --> 00:04:51,434
These little sensors
all over you

146
00:04:51,434 --> 00:04:54,300
and you have a headset,
And you're in what they call,

147
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,501
you know, this space,
this big green box, essentially.

148
00:04:57,501 --> 00:04:59,367
And there are hundreds
and hundreds of cameras

149
00:04:59,367 --> 00:05:02,934
that are picking up all of your
motion, all of your movement.

150
00:05:02,934 --> 00:05:04,801
So it's a -- it's a stran--

151
00:05:04,801 --> 00:05:07,367
It's just an experiment
in imagination, really.

152
00:05:07,367 --> 00:05:08,634
You're just trying to --

153
00:05:08,634 --> 00:05:11,901
-Does that file exist now
forever of Steve Carell?

154
00:05:11,901 --> 00:05:14,200
Will you live forever?
-I hope so.

155
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,667
[ Laughter ]
