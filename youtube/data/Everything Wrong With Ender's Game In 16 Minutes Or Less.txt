[Music]

2
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:10,830
47 seconds of logos philosophical

3
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,679
reading 50 years ago in duration it was

4
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,210
only through the sacrifice of our

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,670
greatest commander that we avoided total

6
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,740
annihilation it was forever known as the

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,600
Randy Quaid maneuver also his one ship

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,980
crashed into that ship and the battle

9
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,570
was over if it's not that it's water or

10
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,220
germs we really underestimate aliens

11
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,390
that have conquered space travel don't

12
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,640
we I am one of those recruits awesome

13
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,869
because if you're not we're talking

14
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:32,250
about a really short movie I'm not

15
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,850
telling you he's the one having either

16
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,829
one you miscalculated you trajectory

17
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:39,480
relative to the incoming asteroid don't

18
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,850
lecture me Wiggin we were told just a

19
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,260
minute ago that this program recruits

20
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,730
the smartest children so what did they

21
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,320
see in this typical cliche movie bully

22
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,670
if the plastic show up in this thing I'm

23
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:48,059
out

24
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:51,899
that's bone hurt a bit what does the end

25
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:54,660
game Enders game telling him it won't

26
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,039
hurt when it clearly will I know they

27
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:57,329
want to see how he'll respond to getting

28
00:00:57,329 --> 00:00:58,710
kicked out of the program lying to him

29
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:01,969
about the pain of this procedure come on

30
00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:03,930
you find out in a minute that the two

31
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,460
bosses are watching this all go down and

32
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:06,630
not stopping it even though someone

33
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:07,560
definitely could have been killed

34
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,380
scanner monitor now that's right no I

35
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,570
watch you now but presumably you bully

36
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:13,860
dicks all still have monitors which

37
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,119
means someone's watching you right I

38
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,110
thought you had to be smart to get into

39
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:19,350
the school and we'll get in trouble for

40
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:20,759
this but he shouldn't he should get a

41
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:22,560
medal in the mom and dad spend all that

42
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,750
money on a third now is up the program

43
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,159
too I've read the book so I know that

44
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,960
third has derogatory connotations

45
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,400
probably to the point the polite society

46
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,290
calls it the T word but I'll be damned

47
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:35,759
if this movie ever explains it I mean if

48
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:36,960
you really wanted to stop what was

49
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,280
happening couldn't you've just broken

50
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,630
one or more of those panes of glass in

51
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,070
the door also this movie's been going

52
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,270
for seven minutes and it's made up of

53
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:46,460
80% ass-beating so far

54
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,360
please state your name

55
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,010
you mean they couldn't call first final

56
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:52,080
step in our evaluation is always to see

57
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,670
what happens when the monitors removed

58
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,350
okay she should finish this by saying

59
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,450
with admiration and you son nearly kick

60
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,180
the guy to death that's not what he did

61
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,110
it's why he did it

62
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:04,320
it was tactical a strategy to stop

63
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,180
future attacks so you must have been

64
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,320
really certain that the bullies would

65
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,760
confront him afterward in order to get

66
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,630
that information huh

67
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,280
you've got what a few hours to make that

68
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,420
determination before he goes home and

69
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,740
you can't monitor him anymore

70
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,330
also it's almost like Harrison Ford took

71
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,100
his branch rickey character from 42 and

72
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,360
just continued it here he wants the guy

73
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,400
who's got the guts not to fight back the

74
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,260
others eyes see the last person on board

75
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,490
this ship it's not like they recruited

76
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:24,660
him while all these other careers we're

77
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:27,170
waiting rank you late out of my control

78
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:29,400
this is the most egregious example thus

79
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,810
far of the you're late problem in

80
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:31,950
Hollywood screenplays there is no

81
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,180
authority relationship between these two

82
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,860
and literally no consequence for the

83
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,390
tardiness just mindless chatter to fill

84
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:40,400
time and what kind of name is that

85
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,300
what's your name names bean your fucking

86
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,920
name is bean and you had the audacity to

87
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,020
mock another person's name you beam you

88
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,239
can dick God you suck the society has

89
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:52,950
solar panel launch rockets and genetic

90
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,959
prediction abilities so other than zero

91
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,459
gravity why would the battle school need

92
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:57,750
to actually take place in space why

93
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,010
can't you train these fools on earth and

94
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:00,390
even simulate zero gravity with your

95
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,850
future technology antigravity vomit anti

96
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,350
grab a vomit there's only one kid on

97
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,810
this launch with any brains at all so

98
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:10,260
far and that's Indra Wiggin this is what

99
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,970
the military refers to as painting the

100
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:14,120
target as isolation can never be broken

101
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,160
they must never believe anyone will help

102
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,350
them what why does your neo commander

103
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:20,190
need to be isolated

104
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,600
you are literally guessing but passing

105
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,010
it off as fact considering you've never

106
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:24,239
done what you're trying to do oh look

107
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,850
it's a smart ass while I understand that

108
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:27,660
they're reacting this way because

109
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,130
Harrison Ford singled amount don't all

110
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:30,450
these kids know the pain of being

111
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:31,709
bullied because of their intellect what

112
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:33,239
they challenge much like he was don't

113
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:34,290
they know everything is a test at this

114
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,239
point I don't have to ask to be by the

115
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,269
door speak your name Andrew Wiggins so

116
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:40,530
they left him this last bunk by the door

117
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:41,940
but somehow saying his name into the

118
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,590
voiceprint thing at this bunk unlocks it

119
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,330
and all the inside the lockers gonna fit

120
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,010
him perfectly but if you're looking for

121
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:51,330
a shoulder to cry on use a pillow do I

122
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:53,549
look like a joke it's not we're all

123
00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:54,959
these assholes already in some sort of

124
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,220
military academy before they made it

125
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,870
here this isn't boot camp they know

126
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:58,650
better if

127
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:01,019
you're found in an area not designated

128
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:03,989
to your gender I will personally do to

129
00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:05,909
you North Carolina welcome to battle

130
00:04:05,909 --> 00:04:09,810
school a great responsibility rests upon

131
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:11,280
each of you and it comes with great

132
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,379
power oh wait get up tonight kids in

133
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:14,610
battle school are subjected to the

134
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:16,440
beginning of Enders game also is this

135
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,000
video of the guy who blew himself up

136
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,410
edited like a Hollywood movie did they

137
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:20,579
find feeds from everywhere like the

138
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:22,470
people who made Chronicle did let's move

139
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,190
it along

140
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,470
geez you've got ten nights ten minutes

141
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,000
is barely enough time to even wake up I

142
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,259
know this is some kind of military or

143
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:29,669
whatever but the entire movie they keep

144
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:30,810
waking people up ten minutes before

145
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:32,850
important about ninety percent of a face

146
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:33,870
ship if you're going to go to ninety

147
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,310
percent why stop there do you need to

148
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,570
let in air if you're gonna leave part of

149
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:38,460
it open presumably for air why not just

150
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,750
shield the eyes and call it a day

151
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,150
like it like they're a bug to be crushed

152
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:43,740
under our feet I just realized this

153
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,419
movie is a lot like Starship Troopers or

154
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:46,770
that Starship Troopers is a lot like

155
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:47,880
this book or something I'm not sure

156
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,229
there's ass in here but I'll have one

157
00:04:49,229 --> 00:04:55,410
just to be sure this is amazing I can't

158
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:57,599
move at all now sounds dope you're

159
00:04:57,599 --> 00:04:59,699
flapping around like a bunch of drunken

160
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:02,699
ducks sergeant explain the game yeah

161
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:04,110
let's insulting recruits before you ever

162
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,310
give them any idea what the fuck was

163
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,410
going on you get one point for hit to a

164
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:09,930
limb sick for at all some of it and this

165
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:11,160
game will somehow prepare you to pilot

166
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,810
massive space warships against other

167
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,610
massive warships just go with it man yes

168
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:15,930
I know they're looking at leadership and

169
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:17,760
tactics but still tons of easier ways to

170
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,800
observe that kind of if either side gets

171
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,889
one cadet through the enemy's gate

172
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:26,250
unharmed that army will win regardless

173
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,199
of points already scored so it's like

174
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:29,430
the snitch in Quidditch and it makes

175
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,479
everything else you do essentially

176
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,120
worthless great game dear Valentine so

177
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,099
this is battle school email raishin and

178
00:05:35,099 --> 00:05:36,960
no one ever adequately explains how

179
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,680
mazer rackham

180
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,990
actually defeated the entire fleet ender

181
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:41,490
would be amazing at cinemasins and it's

182
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:43,320
kind of crazy that this incomplete story

183
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,669
got this much traction over the years

184
00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:46,199
without a great many people questioning

185
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:47,400
it wait a minute didn't ender make a

186
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,479
buddy when they were in the antigravity

187
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,010
chamber or a minute ago is this a thing

188
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:51,930
nerds who shown other nerds sorry now

189
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:54,419
being blocked all communication is being

190
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:56,400
temporarily held back this seems like

191
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,599
something they would have been told like

192
00:05:57,599 --> 00:05:59,099
the first day what benefit is there not

193
00:05:59,099 --> 00:06:00,510
to tell them I feel like the scene was

194
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:01,770
put in so that Harrison Ford could get

195
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:03,389
his mandatory I'm certainly seen in and

196
00:06:03,389 --> 00:06:06,210
fulfill his contract you will never

197
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:08,760
salute you push up shadowing shadow we

198
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,210
have only

199
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:10,800
three passing scores on the deep-space

200
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,750
navigation test now the problem was

201
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,310
simple I'm confused as to how these

202
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,840
other smart kids got into the program if

203
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,250
they couldn't solve this simple problem

204
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,330
if getting through the first leg of the

205
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:19,530
training is so difficult to get into

206
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:21,419
battle school how three people pass this

207
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:23,550
test I mean seriously this is the type

208
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,900
of thing that threatens an entire movies

209
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,580
credibility when dicks like this can get

210
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:27,990
into an elite school that the movie has

211
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:29,460
tried so hard to tell us it's impossible

212
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:32,569
to get into that occasional break in

213
00:06:32,569 --> 00:06:34,650
whose sent fist I love how this

214
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,060
classroom apparently has a class-wide

215
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,830
anonymized chat application running on

216
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,569
all these computers it's working their

217
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:40,830
plan to make enter into a leader by

218
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,419
berating him punishing him and blocking

219
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:43,889
his emails to home is working yay

220
00:06:43,889 --> 00:06:45,660
everyone lights under now and the

221
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,520
shining is still cool welcome to games

222
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,320
and recreations Jesus don't they have

223
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,460
headphones at battle school

224
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,349
holy Christ that's horrifying why would

225
00:06:52,349 --> 00:06:53,759
a game developer in a game where your

226
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,229
actions are supposedly to choose one of

227
00:06:55,229 --> 00:06:57,060
two cups even program in a combination

228
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,770
of buttons to allow this was there no

229
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:00,360
option just to eat the cheese I'm sorry

230
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,039
but you can't play baseball like this

231
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:03,570
any kind of well struck ball will hit

232
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:05,070
the ceiling immediately and later we

233
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,570
find out the battle room is open 24/7

234
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:08,009
why not play this game and the awesome

235
00:07:08,009 --> 00:07:09,479
antigravity chamber since nobody who

236
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:10,830
runs the ship gives a shit what you do

237
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,509
with the free time also bonza must have

238
00:07:12,509 --> 00:07:13,979
thrown quite the fastball for dink to be

239
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:15,210
this late on it and hit it straight to

240
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:16,800
ender who's constantly making dramatic

241
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,780
entrances in this movie quick study I

242
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,479
may be clear I intend to trade you ASAP

243
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:23,190
trade we this training center

244
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,479
inadvertently creates some kind of

245
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:25,889
sports league is baffling he's in charge

246
00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:27,419
of a squad even though he's still just a

247
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:29,310
cadet but he can as a cadet immediately

248
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:30,870
trade away another cadet the boss is

249
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,460
personally assigned to his squad is this

250
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,870
like a sign-and-trade kind of deal here

251
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,159
is he worried about the salary cap I

252
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:37,050
think how did enters custom team uniform

253
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,520
make it here before he did he played the

254
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,960
game they decided to promote him and he

255
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,039
walks straight here the uniform

256
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,330
department in this place deserves a

257
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:44,130
phrase for how on topic they are why

258
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,449
does she even do this like yeah maybe

259
00:07:45,449 --> 00:07:46,530
she's just trying to be nice to the

260
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:48,449
newbie or she like likes it but since

261
00:07:48,449 --> 00:07:49,860
Bonzo told him to do nothing when they

262
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,120
get into the chamber what good is his

263
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,409
practice does she know Enders gonna be

264
00:07:52,409 --> 00:07:53,610
the special that defeats Lord business

265
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:56,789
you don't practice with her in fact you

266
00:07:56,789 --> 00:07:58,320
don't practice at all I realize you need

267
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,729
antagonist in a movie but this guy's

268
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,440
bully boner is absurdly big that's the

269
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,599
Dirk Diggler of bully boners wake up me

270
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,639
spend a horse battle with leopard in ten

271
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:06,270
minutes

272
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:09,450
ten minutes

273
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:11,920
I'll grant the fact that salamanders are

274
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,540
predatory animals but they don't exactly

275
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,860
strike fear into me when I hear their

276
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:15,970
names are you telling me this hyper

277
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:17,560
violent society that fosters violent

278
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,150
cadets is going to end up on salamander

279
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:20,770
for a plane mascot the movie will send

280
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,090
this for us but what an extraordinarily

281
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:24,100
stupid maneuver this is I mean your

282
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,810
solution is to make one big target where

283
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:26,980
the opposing team doesn't have to be all

284
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,150
that accurate when they shoot I mean

285
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:29,980
this movie isn't beloved or anything but

286
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,060
it's stuff like this that made it

287
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,410
passable I'd take action scenes this

288
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:33,940
clever using actual thought and tactics

289
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,770
over 99% of the action scenes I see in

290
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:37,690
movies today but also one session with a

291
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:38,890
girl and suddenly he's spinning

292
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:40,660
spacesuit Jesus with the gunplay also

293
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,640
also the salamander team was like 22 and

294
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,810
out the only reason they're losing right

295
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:45,280
now is to give Endor a reason to show up

296
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,540
and the only reason the movie gave them

297
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,040
an unbelievably perfect winning record

298
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,420
is to somewhat justify the bully boner

299
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,950
late he was watching the action that

300
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:52,180
closely from there you can't see

301
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,800
anything from there why not use video

302
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,390
monitors instead of glass windows really

303
00:08:55,390 --> 00:09:01,200
far away could she want him anymore

304
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,370
somehow allowed to happen by all the

305
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:04,870
adults in this place who spy on everyone

306
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,490
all the time with cameras I'm getting a

307
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:07,600
little tired of how intentionally

308
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,800
ignorant these adults are with the

309
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:14,520
bullying that goes on at this Academy

310
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,750
talans hi she doesn't look anything like

311
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,700
Abigail Breslin video game substitutes

312
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,200
for a dream sequence where we're sure to

313
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,790
see Voldemort at some point yep

314
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:24,370
confirmed I don't his psycho brother end

315
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:26,650
up in the game he's obviously feeling so

316
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,630
psychologically the only reason the game

317
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,190
is doing this as we later learn is

318
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:31,750
because the stupid aliens are trying to

319
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,190
use telepathy to communicate with him a

320
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:34,630
videogame doing this is impossible so

321
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:36,280
the scene for this is that she casually

322
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,660
chalks it up to psychological pricker

323
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,400
instead of a goddamn miracle a software

324
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,280
is better we've only seen him in the

325
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,350
battle room for official matches once we

326
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,610
have however spent a lot of time on a

327
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:46,930
stupid video game where a white Walker

328
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:48,250
makes him drink poison and his brother

329
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,930
is still a dick would you have a habit

330
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:51,670
of upsetting your commander his

331
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,200
commander actually hasn't habit of being

332
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,230
a douche dragon army sure I've never

333
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:58,390
heard of a dragon army we discontinued

334
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:02,260
the name four years ago no dragon army

335
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,790
ever won about I mean did you ever get

336
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:05,260
those uniforms to anyone who could win a

337
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,070
battle is it because you're

338
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,570
superstitious about dragon army or

339
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:08,710
because you never put people in those

340
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:10,360
uniforms who could succeed you know the

341
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,830
Red Sox and Cubs operated just like this

342
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:13,900
486 and 108 years before they realize

343
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,340
there was no curse just teams that

344
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,880
weren't capable of winning

345
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,940
sir because we already have the uniforms

346
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,620
you Harrison Ford's character whose name

347
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,750
I refuse to learn you those uniforms

348
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,250
cannot possibly fit everyone on whatever

349
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,750
team you're putting together stop trying

350
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:27,740
to cover up the fact that this facility

351
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,090
has the fastest and most capable

352
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:30,770
seamstresses alive operating under a

353
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:32,630
dark shadow secrecy I can't be expected

354
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,730
to do all the thinking in this army can

355
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:36,560
I be wow isn't that amazing these

356
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,970
misfits they gave endure just happened

357
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,170
to be people he knew from his training

358
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:44,810
squad but his best friends even awesome

359
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,220
ankle pal well whatever gets Hailee

360
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,840
Steinfeld on my team is a good thing but

361
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,940
like hope that ankle is okay geez look

362
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,620
like that hurt you know if you get under

363
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,880
a sheet on this window he doesn't have

364
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,960
to get woken up by moonlight and

365
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,820
sunlight every 45 minutes let's see how

366
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,080
they hem the formation what kind of

367
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,310
logic is that this is your very first

368
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:59,840
game is dragon army right they don't

369
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,550
know what to expect at all but surely

370
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,840
they think you know some formations

371
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,670
since that's part of the game right we

372
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:06,650
should storm him and crush him yeah we

373
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:08,450
hold our positions he has to come to us

374
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:09,860
not according to the rules of the game

375
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:12,110
it's a point based game unless someone

376
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,490
breaches the other side scape otherwise

377
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:15,410
its points based on leg shots and torso

378
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:16,790
shots I was paying attention and his

379
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,290
team has shot 12 of your soldiers and

380
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:20,090
you've shot one of his ander wins on

381
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:21,560
points with all these kids getting hit

382
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,120
at once and becoming a mobile would they

383
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,440
still be able to hold their positions in

384
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,810
this formation salamander 122 he matches

385
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:28,790
in a row and after this one match dragon

386
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,200
goes to first place why would they even

387
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,730
in second place did the move to cut all

388
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:33,050
the times that they played before this I

389
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:34,340
mean yeah we saw them briefly training a

390
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,170
few minutes ago I guess but were they in

391
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:37,070
actual competitions

392
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:38,330
I'm not saying put cameras in the

393
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,950
showers I'm just saying this facility

394
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,630
has live feed video surveillance of its

395
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:43,550
cadets but somehow let's every single

396
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:44,870
bullying and beating occur with zero

397
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,730
interference my father trained horses

398
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:48,650
I've raised yearlings since I was five

399
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:50,210
years old I know a thoroughbred

400
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,650
because kids and horses are so similar

401
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:53,540
I've had a lot of fights though and

402
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,890
that's just in the last hour the

403
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:56,600
training begins first thing tomorrow

404
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,520
morning I'm confused as to what we've

405
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,830
been doing so far sergeant tap I'll show

406
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,660
you to your quarters because he's the

407
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,980
guy you and the viewing audience are

408
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,510
familiar with he's really the only guy

409
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:07,280
we have to do whatever job he does not

410
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,310
gaudy sir I've already seen this I want

411
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:11,900
to know what happens after oh come on

412
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,610
ender you're a smart kid you know me as

413
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:14,990
a Rackham didn't drag you into the video

414
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:16,340
room to show you the same fucking video

415
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,630
this is the director's cut

416
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:20,870
after the explosion clear

417
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:23,700
everything was incredibly still and I

418
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,080
wrote the script Independence Day on the

419
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:25,590
way down

420
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:27,270
then they started falling out of the sky

421
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:28,830
oh yeah there's nowhere near any of the

422
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,030
thousands of ships that should have

423
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,560
crashed into me like a bad Dave Matthews

424
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,450
Band concert what animal is the formics

425
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:36,480
most often compared dance which have a

426
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,640
cruel so the aliens are hive minded and

427
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,840
that's why all of them died after a

428
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,980
maser killed the Queen seems like a

429
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,420
species this advanced wouldn't have such

430
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,770
a glaring weakness in their defense but

431
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:45,360
that's how you make killing aliens when

432
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,030
you should have no chance in hell easy

433
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:51,150
indy500 Petra is trying to fob in what

434
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,770
when did she get trained to do that

435
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:54,300
it seems like a healthy coincidence to

436
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,190
me play out drones give me for

437
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:58,320
hyperbolic formations with 90-degree

438
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,580
offsets okay

439
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,990
since when do all these people know all

440
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:02,250
there is to know about this simulation

441
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,810
the last we saw ender he was conquering

442
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:05,370
a futuristic version of laser tag and

443
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:06,900
learning basic military strategies but

444
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,190
now at the drop of a hat he and his

445
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:09,330
buddies know all the capabilities of

446
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,710
this thing maybe I missed a training

447
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:12,390
montage how can they be effective if

448
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,680
they don't get any sleep sleep

449
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,480
deprivation is part of your training I'm

450
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,560
not sure that actually enters the

451
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,720
question of one more simulation and I

452
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,910
may have to go to war what happens when

453
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,980
it's no longer a game real war is

454
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:27,090
different or is it dumb what if they

455
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:29,280
could talk to us they can't talk a

456
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,980
hailee steinfeld why empathy to think

457
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,660
like a former nothing he's done so far

458
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,520
demonstrates this but whatever suddenly

459
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,840
rapidly approaching the climax movie

460
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,750
neezy sir it's graduation day why would

461
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,400
you wake up your most valued recruits in

462
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,630
this way why not just give them a time

463
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:44,040
and let them set an alarm what is it

464
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,120
with this movie and waking people up

465
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,800
moments before important events well

466
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,870
that happened I have no idea what it was

467
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,910
but it happened he's abandoning his

468
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:53,760
entire fleet he's in command there's no

469
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,500
stopping him not considering the reveal

470
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,700
we're about to get it's absolutely

471
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,990
stunning that the people in charge don't

472
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:59,370
tackle ender during this maneuver this

473
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:00,990
is gambling the entire fleet something

474
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:02,400
that they know but ender doesn't know

475
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,170
also is there any indication as to why

476
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:05,640
they needed kids to do this and even if

477
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,810
they believed kids were better suited

478
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:08,250
because of their videogame capabilities

479
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,300
or whatever why were there restrictions

480
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,130
on having a third trial seems like a

481
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:12,570
society that goes all-in on children

482
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:13,800
running the military would ask parents

483
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,700
to have as many children as possible

484
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,440
here's the phone Ben Kingsley a

485
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,250
screenshot from the Corps distinct ring

486
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:23,220
you've won all future battles

487
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,810
destroying them see here's where the

488
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:26,459
movie fails if one is read the book and

489
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:27,930
knows how the story ends then the entire

490
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:29,699
movie is a lot and one knows it and it

491
00:14:29,699 --> 00:14:31,110
can't help but keep one from truly

492
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:32,639
experiencing and enjoying the run it's

493
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,259
the rare example where books twist is so

494
00:14:34,259 --> 00:14:35,339
great that the movie ends up being

495
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:36,689
pretty much made solely for the people

496
00:14:36,689 --> 00:14:38,189
who never read the book but that being

497
00:14:38,189 --> 00:14:40,680
said it's a great reveal this should

498
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,000
stand as one of the greatest reveals no

499
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,680
matter the medium so we will remove five

500
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,850
cents the comics access the game for me

501
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:50,189
their thoughts my dreams all mixed

502
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:51,420
together yeah why

503
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,800
I know ender is special but there's no

504
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,000
reason to think they knew about him and

505
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,779
they never tried it with other

506
00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:56,279
candidates because Viola Davis told us

507
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:57,480
those images had never shown up in the

508
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,769
game before and if what they were trying

509
00:14:58,769 --> 00:15:00,300
to communicate why did they do it with a

510
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,920
mix of dreamy imagery to the point that

511
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,449
he couldn't discern a real message okay

512
00:15:03,449 --> 00:15:04,769
okay maybe it was a first Rana and they

513
00:15:04,769 --> 00:15:06,209
needed to iron out the kinks and then

514
00:15:06,209 --> 00:15:07,410
the asshole humans deleted the game

515
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:08,490
before ender could go further

516
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,899
seems like telepathic communication

517
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:11,069
should work with in a confusing video

518
00:15:11,069 --> 00:15:14,069
game mixing up the message Oh a format

519
00:15:14,069 --> 00:15:15,480
Queen stayed behind on this planet after

520
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,769
all the other formats retreated to

521
00:15:16,769 --> 00:15:18,180
another planet and managed to live long

522
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,500
enough to keep a future Queen and the

523
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,029
survival of the species intact and

524
00:15:21,029 --> 00:15:22,319
luckily discovered a child who could

525
00:15:22,319 --> 00:15:23,730
interpret the video game sequence as

526
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:31,830
communication deus ex Formica

527
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:34,030
only through the sacrifice of our

528
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:36,460
greatest commander that we avoided total

529
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:50,040
annihilation

530
00:15:50,040 --> 00:16:01,560
you chose one all right thank you smile

531
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,610
squeeze it turn it

532
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:05,710
what's wrong with this country my money

533
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:07,720
you taught me that evil defense

534
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,990
contractors had it noble causes did not

535
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:12,400
politicians are bought and sold like so

536
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,490
much chattel our problems multiplied you

537
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:18,310
are the weakest link go back I think

538
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:25,140
you're gonna find yourself one smiling

539
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:30,890
[Music]

540
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:35,400
I'm coming up with 32.3 three repeating

541
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:39,450
of course percentage of survival I'm all

542
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:46,640
better and we usually do already guys

543
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:51,030
the Genesis effect matter is reorganized

544
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:55,000
with life generating results
