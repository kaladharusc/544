1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:15,570
what's going on here this games

2
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:17,940
technically from the future she'll be

3
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:24,450
working flawlessly you're using an

4
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:26,310
imperial Nintendo Entertainment System

5
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:29,490
the game you are trying to play star

6
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:32,520
Lars has been restricted by the Empire

7
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,620
for containing facts instead try one of

8
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,260
our compatible and approved games such

9
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:49,080
as Alderaan was an inside job I guess

10
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,370
I'll just have to use one of my region

11
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,290
unlock systems that plays everything in

12
00:00:52,290 --> 00:01:01,079
Gungan basic hey what do you Sabourin

13
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:03,180
this is not the same thing this is bad

14
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,670
you can take my dignity but you can't

15
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,130
take my NES like I said dignity it's

16
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:09,540
fine take it and really have much to

17
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:09,930
begin with

18
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,850
the Nintendo Entertainment System is

19
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:13,320
well known for being the place where you

20
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,240
proved if you were worthy or not it was

21
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,670
the gauntlet for retro games sink or

22
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,650
swim and Star Wars was no exception

23
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,720
let's see how the galaxy far far away

24
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,479
fair right off the bat you get the

25
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,640
awesome theme music although it seems a

26
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,579
little more upbeat than usual

27
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:34,780
the cutscenes here look great for the

28
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,310
NES and really serve the film's well

29
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:38,829
like here's what I mean see that c-3po

30
00:01:38,829 --> 00:01:40,030
is looking at you right in your eyes

31
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:44,710
like you just caught him masturbating in

32
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:46,360
this first level here you go around on

33
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,009
your land speeder I'm assuming this is

34
00:01:48,009 --> 00:01:49,929
Tatooine and you explore various caves

35
00:01:49,929 --> 00:01:51,729
and environments the game mostly takes

36
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:53,320
place on foot with Luke holding his

37
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,450
little blaster but I want my lightsaber

38
00:01:55,450 --> 00:02:03,100
I don't really know that this music fits

39
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,220
doesn't exactly scream star wars you got

40
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,019
your standard affair you got your Tusken

41
00:02:08,019 --> 00:02:10,269
Raiders your Jawas your K flies your

42
00:02:10,269 --> 00:02:11,590
Brendan Fraser's The Mummy

43
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,019
but hold on oh my I mean I don't want

44
00:02:14,019 --> 00:02:15,310
maybe I gotta brush up on my Star Wars

45
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:17,110
lore but I remember was Brendan Fraser

46
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,780
part of this who is this guy what's he

47
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,670
doing here I think he might be in the

48
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:26,920
wrong game yeah who's this oh it's your

49
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,930
boy obi-wan what you're doing in a cave

50
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:31,030
bro it's okay though I know you got good

51
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,620
intentions I can see it's played out all

52
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,620
over your lifeless cross-eyed gaze oh

53
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:38,650
boy what a great crowd tonight what a

54
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:40,690
great audience oh my god

55
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,310
there are so many monsters and scary

56
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,780
things in these caves how will I ever

57
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,459
find my way oh there's an exit sign

58
00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:48,160
right there it would all be hopeless had

59
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,260
it not been for this swell place neon

60
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:53,890
sign thanks whoever put that there it's

61
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:55,480
kind of similar to zelda 2 in the way

62
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,620
that you enter the levels from a

63
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,600
top-down angle only to have those levels

64
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,519
play out as a side scroller this is a

65
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:02,049
style of game that we've seen fall

66
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:03,819
heavily out of popularity since this era

67
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:05,650
most likely to do with the fact that it

68
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:07,239
sucks and I hate it there are a few

69
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:08,980
cockpit dogfighting sections don't like

70
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,639
in the x-wing in the Millennium Falcon I

71
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:14,049
remember being so Jake in here

72
00:03:14,049 --> 00:03:16,060
eventually you do get your lightsaber

73
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,170
which is pretty cool

74
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:18,700
and lucky for you the loss of momentum

75
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,700
need not apply you just barrel through

76
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,850
people at will

77
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:27,980
my god they put a top-down shooter

78
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:30,890
segment into this game has ridiculous

79
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:33,530
variety for the NES I gotta say it's so

80
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:38,200
immersive literally getting drawn in oh

81
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:42,780
sure I am on

82
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:48,380
and just like that she's gone

83
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,960
come on guys look alive you just saved

84
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,040
the whole galaxy

85
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,710
a simple twitch or spasm will do also

86
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,810
Alea has a club head I don't know what's

87
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:58,100
up with that somebody better tell her

88
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,630
while we're at it let's take a look at

89
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,910
the game sequel Empire Strikes Back for

90
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:06,380
NES once again right off the bat

91
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,540
awesome cutscenes and music here the

92
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,130
game has you start out on your taun taun

93
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:12,590
just like Luke's in the film alright I'm

94
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:17,209
ready let's go huh you want to give me a

95
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:20,090
second I just got started here alright

96
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:21,980
just get my bearings back get situated

97
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:26,150
and oh my god what what do you want what

98
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:27,860
is it you have to tell me obi-wan that's

99
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,750
so important the lightsaber is the

100
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,250
weapon of a Jedi oh thank you

101
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,470
fascinating I'm glad you stopped me dead

102
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:35,150
in my tracks to tell me that will you

103
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,130
just let me play the damn game look all

104
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:42,200
I'm saying is oh come on it's a little

105
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,030
hard to control and goddamn somehow the

106
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,800
blaster got even faster this time look

107
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,040
at this thing go oh my god

108
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,170
the heads down everyone Luke's packing

109
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:52,850
that standard-issue pistol over here

110
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:54,410
trust me you don't want to see the heavy

111
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:56,180
artillery the game is mostly a

112
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,950
platformer but like last time it's a

113
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:59,420
hybrid sort of thing when you really get

114
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,400
down to it incorporating many styles of

115
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,710
gameplay

116
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:07,139
well what you can see the game designer

117
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:09,259
credits if you go to this corner here

118
00:05:09,259 --> 00:05:13,470
loo choose the full choose the force I

119
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:14,820
think you're getting that wrong

120
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,770
somewhere but it says still catchy so

121
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:18,930
I'll let it slide you can also do this

122
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:30,479
whatever this is oh oh okay I think

123
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,590
something's definitely happening here oh

124
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:36,180
now that's just absolutely unnecessary

125
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,180
he did not have to die that real

126
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,349
interesting tidbit in this game they

127
00:05:40,349 --> 00:05:42,479
brought back the atari 2600 version of

128
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,820
Empire Strikes Back entirely as its own

129
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,009
level you may recognize it by its better

130
00:05:47,009 --> 00:05:49,919
known name bird vs. camel pretty crazy

131
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,780
right what used to be sold as an entire

132
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,090
game ten years prior is now just one

133
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:56,160
minor portion of a larger game that's

134
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,380
progress and most importantly though you

135
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:02,580
can shoot up the foot of the 8080 in

136
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:08,940
down to there Kevin time for a back-up

137
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,530
plan sir the enemy appears to be totally

138
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:19,330
enjoying getting it up the butt Oh

139
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:20,720
okay

140
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,340
I didn't mean sustained some serious

141
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,430
damage but well you know I think I might

142
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:31,280
make it out all right Oh oh wow that

143
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,410
turned out a lot better than expected I

144
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:36,440
even got my own little lightsaber hahaha

145
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,419
I'm invincible I'm a god I don't even

146
00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:39,980
need a snow speeder I'm coming for you

147
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,630
here I come I'm gonna break the game

148
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,970
I'll care about the rock and roll by the

149
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,710
end you finally get to battle

150
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:48,290
face-to-face with Darth Vader who sits

151
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:50,419
there and endlessly fires a blaster at

152
00:06:50,419 --> 00:06:53,870
you just like in the movies and then a

153
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:56,690
mother lode jumping up a generation we

154
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:59,360
have the super star wars games for me

155
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,890
there was absolutely nothing like

156
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:02,480
booting one of these up colorful

157
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,160
action-packed and each and every one

158
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,350
unique in their own way this was as good

159
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:06,950
as it gets

160
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,840
there's not much bad to say about these

161
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,550
games barring mentioning their brutal

162
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:12,110
difficulty it was one of those games

163
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,880
where the enemies don't stop spawning

164
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,500
out of nowhere so it was easy to take

165
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,340
hits when he didn't want to why does the

166
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,979
blaster keep getting faster and faster

167
00:07:21,979 --> 00:07:23,810
with each instalment how are they even

168
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,690
gonna keep that up at the current rate

169
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:28,370
of technological growth we predict by

170
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:31,100
the far-off year of 2002 the blasters

171
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,010
will approximately firing this fast oh

172
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:35,750
my goodness I fired directly into the

173
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:42,950
gallery Oh Oh aah now you may think

174
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:45,350
that's where the old Nintendo Star Wars

175
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:48,860
games end but rumor has it there exists

176
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:51,800
another game you know far often

177
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,919
forbidden land to the east

178
00:07:54,919 --> 00:08:08,370
and for this we must look to eBay

179
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:13,050
ah here it is yes in fact there exists a

180
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:15,540
Japanese version of Star Wars solely for

181
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,979
the Japanese version of the NES the

182
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:19,410
Famicom and it's completely different

183
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:20,790
from the American version in every

184
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:22,889
aspect from the ground up the game

185
00:08:22,889 --> 00:08:24,210
starts off with Luke looking at a

186
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:26,370
transmission from Leia as shown by r2d2

187
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:29,220
standard stuff so far Leia I'm walking

188
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:33,240
here okay you go around whacking little

189
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,099
owl dudes and other monsters that nie

190
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:37,349
don't really recall from Star Wars in

191
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:39,180
this rendition of course Luke Skywalker

192
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:41,550
is played by a jean-claude Van Damme

193
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:43,620
pretty much everything you slice with

194
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,480
your saber just explodes instantly in

195
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,190
proper Japanese fashion the

196
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,320
stormtroopers are freakin adorable also

197
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,940
you better like the Star Wars theme if

198
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,470
you're gonna play this I mean you better

199
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:55,050
love it because this loop is all it

200
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:58,769
plays

201
00:08:58,769 --> 00:09:01,749
what it's a little early to see Darth

202
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:03,819
Vader isn't it it doesn't usually spend

203
00:09:03,819 --> 00:09:06,040
as valuable time in the first-level and

204
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,839
whatever if it's a fight you want Vader

205
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:12,550
it's a fight you'll get

206
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:18,529
excuse me why that's a scorpion

207
00:09:18,529 --> 00:09:21,260
I see no I've seen a few times take a

208
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,300
few from the desert that's this question

209
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,210
right there I feel like at this point

210
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:28,100
asking questions is besides the point

211
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,010
irrelevant really but no you know I

212
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:33,200
think I will have to inquire why did

213
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,320
Darth Vader turn into a scorpion I don't

214
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,730
even know if this was originally

215
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:39,709
supposed to be a Star Wars game why is

216
00:09:39,709 --> 00:09:41,540
there a level with Egyptian symbolism

217
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,820
you fight all sorts of crazy enemies

218
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,440
that look like they fit more into Zelda

219
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,880
than Star Wars what the hell this

220
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,220
doesn't look like it should be anywhere

221
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,110
near this series it's like something

222
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:57,410
from a Mario game yes just as I planned

223
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:58,040
it

224
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,720
Darth Vader is much weaker when

225
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,459
submerged in water and cannot breathe

226
00:10:01,459 --> 00:10:03,709
why am i swimming and he's not that's

227
00:10:03,709 --> 00:10:07,209
not fair

228
00:10:07,209 --> 00:10:10,160
cool this time he's a fish what a

229
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,620
trickster I suppose the whole thing here

230
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,570
is just going around saving your friends

231
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:20,220
from various anamorphic Darth Vader's

232
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:23,280
oh good

233
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,930
demonium Falcon was here the whole time

234
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:26,790
now that's good to know

235
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,710
glad to know I didn't even need to swim

236
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:30,150
all that way the Millennium Falcon could

237
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,200
have just taken me straight where I

238
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,090
wanted to go especially considering it

239
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,760
can just fly right beside this magical

240
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,610
floating body of water you know what no

241
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:40,020
this is great fun

242
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,610
you're always guessing what kind of

243
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:43,050
crazy creature you're gonna turn into

244
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:47,130
this time Vader well that time it was

245
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:50,400
just actually him I think poor guy I

246
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,840
just want I just want a slaughter an

247

really worked to get that you look happy

251
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,770
that's good for you you know there was a

252
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:03,630
lesson in all this and what that lesson

253
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,400
was I don't really know but I tell you

254
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,170
one thing's for sure be careful here

255
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:09,270
damage for they may become a scary

256
