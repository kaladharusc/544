average year no arcade nothing crazy

nothing big but still super nice and

207
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,110
I've always wanted to do one of those

208
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:05,370
big group dinners and I was glad to get

209
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:07,949
to do it with I can't believe 20-some

210
00:10:07,949 --> 00:10:09,480
people showed up that's pretty crazy

211
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,839
friends I haven't seen in years and it's

212
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:14,009
kind of nice and then having them back

213
00:10:14,009 --> 00:10:15,990
to the place to have some fun and show

214
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:19,949
Sammy exactly what to do but now I'm

215
00:10:19,949 --> 00:10:21,959
gonna pass out I don't know if I've ever

216
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:23,730
shown you this on camera but sometimes

217
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:24,959
whenever we have to go somewhere with

218
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:25,319
Sammy

219
00:10:25,319 --> 00:10:27,180
we don't always put them in the kennel I

220
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,860
put them in this little puppy sling I

221
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,569
figured since I'm wearing one sling on

222
00:10:30,569 --> 00:10:32,129
my arm I could wear a second fling today

223
00:10:32,129 --> 00:10:34,860
I gave him his knowledge in medicine

224
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,569
which just makes him really tired so

225
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:38,129
he'll be really cool and really chill at

226
00:10:38,129 --> 00:10:39,959
the groomers and then I could just carry

227
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:41,970
him around in my little little puppy

228
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:44,129
sling and he doesn't seem to mind at all

229
00:10:44,129 --> 00:10:46,259
