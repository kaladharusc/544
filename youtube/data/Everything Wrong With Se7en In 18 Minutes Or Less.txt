[Music]

2
00:00:07,889 --> 00:00:09,879
what is it with characters and movies

3
00:00:09,879 --> 00:00:11,499
with active chessboards and no one to

4
00:00:11,499 --> 00:00:11,860
play with

5
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:13,570
is it to subtly remind the audience that

6
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:15,669
this guy is smart as if the two hours of

7
00:00:15,669 --> 00:00:16,840
movie wouldn't be able to cover that on

8
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,300
its own you actually fought to get

9
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,850
reassigned here yeah what's up with that

10
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:22,480
by the way

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,790
Mills mentions in passing he wants to do

12
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:26,860
some good but that is the only reason he

13
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,270
moves him and poor Gwyneth to this

14
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:30,400
godforsaken City gonna remove a sin for

15
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,289
the opening credit yep the opening

16
00:00:32,289 --> 00:00:34,359
credits which were revolutionary and set

17
00:00:34,359 --> 00:00:36,159
the proper mood for the movie are about

18
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:38,440
to see often when you are insane you

19
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,059
feel the need to black out words on a

20
00:00:40,059 --> 00:00:41,649
pregnancy and your sense of smell

21
00:00:41,649 --> 00:00:43,269
article if the public were to get their

22
00:00:43,269 --> 00:00:44,589
hands on this information many of our

23
00:00:44,589 --> 00:00:46,359
top spies overseas would be discovered I

24
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:48,159
mean really the only thing the opening

25
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:49,839
credits shows us is that John Doe is an

26
00:00:49,839 --> 00:00:51,699
excellent scrapbooker as we will soon

27
00:00:51,699 --> 00:00:53,139
find out about a third of this movie

28
00:00:53,139 --> 00:00:54,999
will be people putting on ties the other

29
00:00:54,999 --> 00:00:57,159
third will be scenes in the ring and yet

30
00:00:57,159 --> 00:00:58,749
despite this the movie remains a

31
00:00:58,749 --> 00:01:00,999
masterpiece discuss this unknown city

32
00:01:00,999 --> 00:01:03,699
loss new angel' york will have constant

33
00:01:03,699 --> 00:01:05,290
rain for seven days and absolutely no

34
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:13,360
flooding I know this cops not a

35
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,040
detective but is that seriously this

36
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,600
assholes criteria for confirming this

37
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,370
dude to death sure the victims in

38
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:19,510
terrible shape and the fact that he's

39
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:21,010
toast is pretty obvious but even a

40
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:23,770
rent-a-cop would check vital signs also

41
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:25,300
we've seen that the electricity works

42
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,340
since the TVs and lights are on in

43
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:29,200
living room so could they not put on an

44
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,910
overhead in the kitchen or is it against

45
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:32,260
this movie's rules to have any lighting

46
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,380
said this was learned

47
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,049
Oh what then why they was homicide

48
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:38,610
immediately called him to investigate

49
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:41,159
Oh wonderful very moody David Fincher's

50
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:42,899
reactions to the dailies somehow made it

51
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:44,490
into the script as you can tell this

52
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:45,720
movie was supposed to be the story of

53
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,369
Noah at one point the original script

54
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:48,780
followed the Bible closely but they

55
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,340
added a seven deadly sins plot and

56
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,200
changed all the characters the rain no

57
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:59,220
stay shut in who never went outside and

58
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,020
yet anger John Doe so much at the sight

59
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,280
of him that he needed to kill it

60
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,990
I'm wondering did John Doe answer

61
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,310
help-wanted ads for people who were

62
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,869
wreck losses until he found his gluttony

63
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:09,450
this was 1995 so II gluttony wasn't

64
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:11,459
around them the bucket beneath him kept

65
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:14,459
on serving took his time to car and I

66
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:15,720
said this could have gone on for more

67
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,640
than 12 hours what a hilariously

68
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,380
specific time frame this coroner came up

69
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,910
with I mean does he have previous

70
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,500
experience on a case where someone was

71
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,180
forced to eat himself to death and made

72
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,900
a second trip to the supermarket so a

73
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:31,590
man just after spending the last several

74
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:32,700
minutes bitching about being taken

75
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,680
seriously as a detective detective Mills

76
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,540
here refuses to provide any details on

77
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:44,340
his first case in the precinct sergeant

78
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,500
Hartman which is it can you swap cases

79
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,000
or can't you I'm beginning to think John

80
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,440
Doe didn't hate people because of their

81
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,359
deadly sins but because they had to TBS

82
00:02:51,359 --> 00:02:53,010
the lawyer here and the gluttony guy

83
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:57,470
earlier we're going to go live downtown

84
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:00,030
the forensics guys turn on the TVs to

85
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,230
have some background noise while they

86
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:02,700
were working on the crime scene because

87
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,200
otherwise this is extremely convenient

88
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,400
not only are they on

89
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,019
but that Mills comes in right as the

90
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:08,310
press conference for the very case he's

91
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,780
working on begins I know they're

92
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,100
probably still unpacking their clothes

93
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,840
from the move but chased Mill

94
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,489
specifically order this shirt with extra

95
00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:21,810
wrinkles but every newspaper in town had

96
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,400
this story as their headline even if

97
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,900
Gould were discovered early in the

98
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,160
morning there's no way all the

99
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,420
newspapers would be able to stop the

100
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,680
presses and get this entire story

101
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,510
printed this keep out sticker was placed

102
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:31,920
on the inside of the door of a crime

103
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,010
scene I guess that's a prank

104
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:38,239
John Doe was betting so much on

105
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:39,859
Somerset's great detective skills that

106
00:03:39,859 --> 00:03:41,420
he fed his victim wood shards from the

107
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,829
floor in front of the refrigerator

108
00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:45,019
look I'm not knocking Somerset this was

109
00:03:45,019 --> 00:03:46,909
a terrific deduction but the fact that

110
00:03:46,909 --> 00:03:48,739
doe knew he'd be able to figure it out

111
00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:50,540
is yet more bull than this bullshit II

112
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:55,689
plant sloth wrath pride lust and envy

113
00:03:55,689 --> 00:04:01,219
several credits that's great pal but I

114
00:04:01,219 --> 00:04:03,109
need a destination otherwise we're going

115
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:04,879
to the default far away from here which

116
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:11,510
is Manhattan Kansas the economy was

117
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:13,549
great back in 1995 because libraries

118
00:04:13,549 --> 00:04:15,049
could afford to have multiple night

119
00:04:15,049 --> 00:04:16,489
watchmen guarding books overnight that

120
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:22,669
nobody wants to read anyway

121
00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:25,230
sick burn man but do these assholes

122
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,669
really sit around and listen to Bach

123
00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:28,380
when they play poker reading really

124
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,940
getting the feeling that Somerset's just

125
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,139
skipping right to the pictures in these

126
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:32,790
great works of literature probably on

127
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,169
the off chance he might see some hand

128
00:04:34,169 --> 00:04:34,830
drawn boobs

129
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,600
Somerset writes a note to mills telling

130
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,650
him he might want to check out some

131
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,360
books on the seven deadly sins probably

132
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,919
to understand the killer better but how

133
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:42,870
does that get them closer to the killer

134
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,639
it literally could be anyone feel like

135
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,169
this is something a smart person tells

136
00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:47,880
themselves they need to do but they end

137
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,260
up wasting time reading The Canterbury

138
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,699
Tales when they should be interviewing

139
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:52,590
all the Catholics in the area apparently

140
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:55,139
after a 16-hour copying scene Somerset

141
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:56,910
was able to fit all those copies into an

142
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:58,530
envelope without massively inflating it

143
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:00,180
seriously my guess is that David Fincher

144
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,650
held stock and a rain machine company

145
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:06,500
when he decided to do this project

146
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,000
William I'm less concerned about this

147
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,620
semi an appropriate question than I am

148
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,240
the previous conversation was boring

149
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,830
enough that Somerset started folding a

150
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,030
fucking napkin to keep his attention

151
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:18,330
real estate so this is the place two

152
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:20,220
times still wondering why will he only

153
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,050
brings you for five minutes at a time

154
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,430
yeah you guys were shopping for

155
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,840
apartments and you agreed to look at one

156
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,150
several times five minutes at a time and

157
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:28,590
by the way how did this real estate guy

158
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,120
time the fucking crane so well during

159
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:36,300
that many visits damn I love this cast

160
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,700
now listen the body was found on Tuesday

161
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,530
morning the office was closed on Monday

162
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:42,750
which means I could have gotten in on

163
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,789
Friday they load to the cleaning crew

164
00:05:44,789 --> 00:05:46,740
left and had his way with gould all day

165
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,570
saturday they'll go on to explain that

166
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:49,979
his wife was out of town during all of

167
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:51,750
this but she didn't try to contact her

168
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:54,930
husband for four days was what attrition

169
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:57,030
is when you regret your sins but not

170
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:58,950
because you love God religious issue

171
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,539
safe house that's supposed to be a house

172
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:02,400
of safety leaves the front door wide the

173
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,139
fuck open luckily all these shots of a

174
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:05,880
dead Gould are the perfect sign is to be

175
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,610
redacted with a regular post-it note

176
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:10,910
[Music]

177
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,110
funny I watched that scene and I don't

178
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:14,820
remember Mills ever telling mrs. Gould

179
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,349
that he wanted to catch this guy may

180
00:06:16,349 --> 00:06:17,490
have happened off screen but that

181
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:20,220
doesn't count dying once on a deserted

182
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:25,260
island save them in case we get rescued

183
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,060
thankfully Mills interjects here because

184
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,470
Somerset was running low on metaphors

185
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,180
for the emptiness of life of a detective

186
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,520
in this town he's got a long history of

187
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,700
serious mental health

188
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,010
his parents gave him a very strict

189
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:37,870
Southern Baptist upbringing since I

190
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,850
added this stupidly specific last detail

191
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:41,410
to this briefing I'd also like to

192
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:42,460
mention that his favorite food is

193
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,060
lasagna

194
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,800
he loves Mad About You and he prefers

195
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,240
blue underwear the guy they're about to

196
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,070
arrest is victim number three the sloth

197
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:50,050
victim sloth defined by the Catholic

198
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:51,910
faith is first and foremost very hard to

199
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,770
define it's basically a person who can't

200
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:55,390
move who doesn't care about himself or

201
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:55,720
others

202
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,820
John Doe apparently defines it as almost

203
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,890
every criminals rap sheet is larger by

204
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:02,140
the way as recently safety like oh my

205
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,790
gosh is the captain continuing this

206
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,260
briefing while walking the entire team

207
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,000
down a staircase this ensures that only

208
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,230
part of the team will actually hear the

209
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:09,850
information apparently the police do not

210
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:11,290
believe any other crime is scheduled

211
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:13,120
today then send the entire force to pick

212
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,560
up a guy who's easily been arrested

213
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,600
several times in the past never took

214
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,660
never took a bullet pulled my gun once

215
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:23,440
shot it once I'm shadowing SWAT before

216
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,970
dicks then why the hell weren't you at

217
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:27,070
the front of the line then gotta ask if

218
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,570
this guy smells this bad what air

219
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:30,040
fresheners really conceal it wouldn't

220
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,750
the neighbors smell him anyway even so

221
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,580
is the mix of every different air

222
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,960
freshener scent really that more

223
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,250
appealing than the funk of this dudes

224
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,140
rotting body I think it's hilarious that

225
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,880
John Doe hung tons of air fresheners on

226
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,350
the ceiling but decided to hang one on

227
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:45,580
the lamp just for good measure okay guys

228
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,870
this is one of the most intense moments

229
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:49,330
in film history here it's set up so well

230
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:50,980
I mean there's no way this guy's alive

231
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,870
right and he's not the killer so there's

232
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:53,920
nothing in your brain that tells you

233
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,540
this scare is coming it deserves five

234
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,180
cents off and therefore we will grant it

235
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:00,100
he's experienced about as much pain and

236
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,360
suffering as anyone I've encountered

237
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,060
give or take and he's still that's held

238
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,830
to look forward to Jesus Christ it

239
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,330
sounds like this doctor is on his last

240
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:09,190
week of work don't let this guy near any

241
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:11,260
family members after our car crash sorry

242
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,970
folks your son died from horrible brain

243
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:14,320
injuries sustained in the crash I just

244
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,940
wanted you to hear from me that God is

245
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,410
dead and no one cares to quote a

246
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:19,480
favorite musician of mine also give or

247
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,640
take what this doctor seen a case that's

248
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,110
anywhere near this level of suffering

249
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,580
you know the kind of suffering that

250
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,410
makes you eat your own pink tongue I

251
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:27,420
hate

252
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,700
I had a relationship once goddamn

253
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,230
Somerset why do you always have to make

254
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:33,030
it about you damn looks like mills and

255
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,560
Somerset are confident which deaths will

256
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,030
take place next the way this list is

257
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,560
numbered to break up the monotony of the

258
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,240
crime scene footage the fellas throw the

259
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,160
top 10 combat handguns up on the wall

260
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,410
welcome to that apartment exactly one

261
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:45,900
year after you tied to the bed one year

262
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:52,350
to the date yeah but how remember this

263
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:54,000
required the lawyers wife to notice a

264
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,740
painting in his office was upside down

265
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,450
which required a good detective to dust

266
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:59,100
the wall for fingerprints this had been

267
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,270
just Mill's on the case they would have

268
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:02,690
missed that anniversary he's a nut bag

269
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:05,490
just because of he's got a library card

270
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:07,890
doesn't make him Yoda Mills pulls out

271
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:09,690
the dr.house moment with a random quote

272
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:11,520
about a fing library card which inspires

273
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,050
Somerset to pay a guy to figure out

274
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:14,310
who's checking out certain books of the

275
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:16,290
library yep there was a Brad Pitt eat

276
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,240
something in every movie he's in cliche

277
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,730
even way back in 1995 if you want to

278
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,620
know who's reading purgatory and

279
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:26,220
paradise lost and helter skelter yeah

280
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,350
yeah ask them to what tell us you mean

281
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:30,570
they flank purgatory and paradise lost

282
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,970
the fore and Somerset said the stuff

283
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,350
about nuclear weapons and Hitler that

284
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:35,850
made sense but stuff that a freshman in

285
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,140
high school would check out are you

286
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:41,700
kidding me library ex machina you mean

287
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,870
to tell me the guy who planned these

288
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,460
murders actually checked out books from

289
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,320
a king library rather than paying cash

290
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,880
to some bookstore for these books the

291
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,380
guy is apparently wealthy so why the

292
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,210
rentals also he was able to use the

293
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:53,070
alias Jonathan Doe but he couldn't get

294
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,720
away with making up a fake address not

295
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,790
to mention why even used Jonathan Doe

296
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,230
why not darrell bishop or something less

297
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:03,570
conspicuous bills motley for everyone

298
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,160
involved in this scene John Doe went to

299
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,870
the stormtrooper school of aiming if Doe

300
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,340
is trying to get away then why is he

301
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,930
hanging around waiting to shoot blind

302
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:11,550
shots up a staircase to try and kill the

303
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:13,380
ticked up mills Doe somehow managed to

304
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,490
make it out of this window without

305
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:15,780
disturbing anything on the sink or

306
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,130
knocking over the pill bottles on the

307
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:19,290
windowsill look I love David Fincher and

308
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:21,150
he does beautiful movies the fact that I

309
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,740
can't tell who is where and where they

310
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,210
are in relation to each other makes me

311
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:25,470
think this action scene is no better

312
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:26,670
than something in Resident Evil

313
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:28,500
apocalypse rather than just breaking to

314
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,940
avoid hitting the man running in the

315
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,050
middle of the street this cab driver

316
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:32,280
thinks the better option is to

317
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,750
potentially kill many people on the

318
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,310
sidewalk considering that John Doe

319
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:37,020
doesn't kill David after this what's the

320
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,790
fucking point it could have hit up here

321
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,360
for hours no one would have known

322
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,800
you might say this is part of his new

323
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,690
plan but Somerset could easily be

324
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:48,820
seconds away and this whole thing up so

325
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,350
neither of you guys are gonna call back

326
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,970
to the station reporting the assault of

327
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:53,529
an officer and probably some dead ass

328
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:57,670
pedestrians goddamnit look I'm sure this

329
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,110
happens and the movies got a long way to

330
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:00,820
show us how Mills feeds on his emotions

331
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,980
in crap but come on even a guy who's as

332
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,630
pissed as he is would be able to listen

333
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,339
to reason hear and know that breaking

334
00:11:06,339 --> 00:11:07,779
down this door is the end of getting a

335
00:11:07,779 --> 00:11:09,460
conviction then they pay some homeless

336
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,600
person to come up with an eyewitness

337
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,800
account like that's gonna hold up in

338
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,420
court did you know someone actually took

339
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,190
the time to write all this stuff out to

340
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:16,810
be seen for mere seconds and a movie

341
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:18,670
that's some detail right there it's

342
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:19,900
almost like David Fincher knew there

343
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,070
would be some dickhead youtube-channel

344
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,570
trying to point out flaws in this

345
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:25,120
awesome movie twenty-two years later we

346
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,860
had Mills discovers that the

347
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:29,020
photographer he told Bob earlier is the

348
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,520
guy they were looking for but how would

349
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,990
they have had him even if you let the

350
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:33,550
guy take pictures and ask questions and

351
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:34,870
would they have figured out that he was

352
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:38,920
the killer Wow

353
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,480
based on this sketch artist the real

354
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,830
surprise ending of this movie is that

355
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:43,690
John Doe is played by Patrick Stewart on

356
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:45,850
the subway today a man came up to me to

357
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:48,310
start a conversation he made small talk

358
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:50,350
it's lonely man talking about the

359
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:51,910
weather and other things get the feeling

360
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,440
that John Doe wrote all these volumes of

361
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,610
his journal in the hopes that they would

362
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,020
one day be read and the voice of Morgan

363
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,700
Freeman Somerset turns on his tape

364
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,170
recorder and holds it in a place that in

365
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:00,910
no way will pick up john doe's voice so

366
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:06,580
clearly but it does anyway this is where

367
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,200
you realize John Doe doesn't really have

368
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,730
a plan for all seven murders right now

369
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,170
because all the cops can find in his

370
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:12,730
apartment is the very next victim and

371
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:14,800
none of the ones after that and yet John

372
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,630
Doe knew he was going to chain the sloth

373
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,370
guy to a bid for a whole year and

374
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,990
intended him to be a third death which

375
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:22,209
suggests a very particular plan so why

376
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:23,740
can't they find the others meanwhile

377
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,270
he's taking photos of all his victims

378
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:27,130
all the way through victim four but not

379
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:29,350
victim five the pride victim seriously

380
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,970
EBIT if he's planning on becoming NBD

381
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:32,650
and mills becoming a wrath you should at

382
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:33,970
least have the pride victim photographed

383
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:35,620
someone they should be able to find and

384
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,209
prevent the murderer even since she's a

385
00:12:37,209 --> 00:12:38,890
popular model and there's no way John

386
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:40,750
Doe knew he'd be envied and that the

387
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,490
recently reassigned David would be the

388
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:46,110
wrath one year in advance

389
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:48,280
hard to determine if John Doe was

390
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,720
walking with a limp because of the fight

391
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,340
with Mills or because he was still in

392
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,020
character as a verbal Kint considering

393
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,310
the movies came out within a week of

394
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:56,770
each other yes yes I was married so wait

395
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,000
John knew he could go to this

396
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,710
underground prostitution place to kill

397
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:01,480
the lust victim but didn't know whom he

398
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,890
was gonna get to do that until that day

399
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:05,080
also does a prostitute really count as

400
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,400
lust when they're doing it for the money

401
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,810
this guy's been planning his murder

402
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:09,520
spree for years observing all sorts of

403
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,900
people and writing about it in his

404
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,580
Diaries and he didn't run into a man

405
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,990
cheating on his wife or something to

406
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:17,890
that effect so much oh yeah remember

407
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:19,120
Gwyneth Paltrow being in this movie

408
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,770
Looby is overtly reminding you of that

409
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:22,540
before the final act for no reason at

410
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,890
all before he goes to sleep every night

411
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:25,900
Morgan Freeman practices his unflappable

412
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,310
stare at the wall which is rightfully

413
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:32,890
intimidated you metronome I mean come on

414
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:34,630
this is apparently a well-known model

415
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:35,980
and he didn't have a picture of her

416
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,630
anywhere in the apartment he didn't plan

417
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:41,500
this murder yesterday Jesus think about

418
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,180
John Doe Sunday he kills the pride

419
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,890
victim the night before he waits around

420
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,450
for Gabey to go to work then he tries to

421
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,190
play husband with Tracy and it doesn't

422
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:49,990
work out so he kills Tracy puts her head

423
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:51,550
in a box finds a guy who can deliver the

424
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:52,990
box by 7:00 to some remote location

425
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:55,600
finds a willing taxi driver to drive him

426
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,430
with his bloody clothes to the police

427
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:57,940
station

428
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,920
no questions asked client also wishes to

429
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,750
inform you that if you do not accept he

430
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,250
will plead insanity across the board

431
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,380
because after all the insanity plea is

432
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,540
used successfully in so many cases not

433
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,590
to mention the fact that you don't just

434
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:09,700
get to go free when you plead insanity

435
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,440
you have to go to a mental hospital and

436
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,790
live your life as Sarah Connor

437
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,650
if you were to claim insanity this

438
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:16,990
conversation is admissible two more are

439
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,970
dead the press would have a field day if

440
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:20,380
they were to find out the police didn't

441
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,700
seem too concerned about finding them

442
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,170
yeah but they're technically already

443
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:25,030
dead and these are very detective II

444
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,220
detectives so they presumably be able to

445
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,480
track these bodies down over time

446
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,710
basically I'm saying that even though

447
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:31,060
they don't know in the last two victims

448
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,800
are crazy and John Doe this is a flimsy

449
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,210
reason to go along with this plan

450
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:36,640
I'm enjoying life right now we caught

451
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,900
the killer and my wife remains

452
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,910
completely on behind such weird thoughts

453
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,860
I have in times like these sure what

454
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,930
this neo-noir gruesome detective movie

455
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:45,820
needs is yet another police officers

456
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,920
gearing up for battle montage could the

457
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,529
freak be any more vague

458
00:14:49,529 --> 00:14:51,449
I can't wait for you to see I really can

459
00:14:51,449 --> 00:14:53,370
this ends up being an amazing scene but

460
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:54,600
it's easy to forget that the first

461
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,920
several minutes consist of mills and

462
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,839
douve a Glee trading innocuous insults

463
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,290
and a beast man a disgusting man who

464
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:03,120
could barely stand up a man who if you

465
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,620
saw him on the street you point him out

466
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,149
to your friends yeah but I'm still

467
00:15:06,149 --> 00:15:07,259
trying to figure out when you actually

468
00:15:07,259 --> 00:15:09,180
saw this guy a shut-in who never

469
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,999
wandered outside in a world this D could

470
00:15:11,999 --> 00:15:13,529
you even try to say these were innocent

471
00:15:13,529 --> 00:15:15,779
people and keep a straight face I mean

472
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:17,160
you had to know it was coming for

473
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,319
Spacey's performance alone right we see

474
00:15:19,319 --> 00:15:21,389
a deadly sin on every street corner in

475
00:15:21,389 --> 00:15:24,269
every home and we tolerated John Doe

476
00:15:24,269 --> 00:15:25,680
just described what it's like for cinema

477
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,059
sins to see a movie like fate of the

478
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:28,529
furious become a hit not only in

479
00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:30,389
theaters but on blu-ray in fact one

480
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:31,920
could say that the whole franchise is

481
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,509
the seven deadly sins of cinema and loi

482
00:15:33,509 --> 00:15:36,300
here's 15 more because we hate got pills

483
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,040
the fact that this man is allowed to get

484
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,509
anywhere near these assholes while

485
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:40,559
they're supposedly under heavy

486
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:41,819
surveillance is the least believable

487
00:15:41,819 --> 00:15:42,930
thing in this movie

488
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:44,759
this guy paid me 500 bucks to bring it

489
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:47,279
out here man he said he wanted to hear

490
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,139
at exactly 7 o'clock he was covered in

491
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:50,790
blood but he seemed like a nice guy

492
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,439
I know Somerset knows this killer

493
00:15:52,439 --> 00:15:54,059
wouldn't put a bomb in this box but you

494
00:15:54,059 --> 00:15:55,649
have to be me that he's gonna open it

495
00:15:55,649 --> 00:15:56,910
right here now without truly knowing

496
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:58,589
what it is and luckily for John Doe he

497
00:15:58,589 --> 00:16:00,389
does because if he follows the normal

498
00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:01,800
procedure Mills never gets a chance to

499
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,449
kill him John Doe has the upper hand

500
00:16:03,449 --> 00:16:05,939
John Doe was certain that Somerset would

501
00:16:05,939 --> 00:16:07,860
be this far away so that he could tell

502
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,389
Mills about killing his wife before he

503
00:16:09,389 --> 00:16:10,740
got back and was able to talk sense into

504
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:13,139
him I wish I could have lived like man

505
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,540
this reveal is terrific it really is but

506
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,069
the env part of this equation feels

507
00:16:17,069 --> 00:16:18,930
forced as hell doesn't it in the Cardo

508
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:21,000
was openly contemptuous of Mills but now

509
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,889
as long as he says he admires him this

510
00:16:22,889 --> 00:16:24,779
qualifies as a sim really think that

511
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:26,100
just chopping off his wife's head was

512
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:29,819
proven up I says I am via normal life it

513
00:16:29,819 --> 00:16:32,069
seems that Envy is my scene let's talk

514
00:16:32,069 --> 00:16:33,929
about john doe's plant it plans seven

515
00:16:33,929 --> 00:16:35,309
murders to represent the seven deadly

516
00:16:35,309 --> 00:16:35,730
sins

517
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:38,129
there's no way he knew he would be

518
00:16:38,129 --> 00:16:39,809
envied and that he gets someone to

519
00:16:39,809 --> 00:16:41,160
become wrath once he told him what he

520
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,199
did luckily he ran into hothead David

521
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:44,309
Mills while he was committing the

522
00:16:44,309 --> 00:16:45,779
murders and decided to change his plan

523
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:46,319
midstream

524
00:16:46,319 --> 00:16:48,209
also luckily for doe he did not kill an

525
00:16:48,209 --> 00:16:50,069
envy or wrath before this and doe

526
00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:51,360
somehow doesn't see the killing Traci

527
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,920
fucks up the seven deadly sin murders

528
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,259
Traci isn't part of the motif and David

529
00:16:55,259 --> 00:16:56,639
isn't going to die for being wrath

530
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,199
unless it's some sort of symbolic death

531
00:16:58,199 --> 00:16:59,639
I think John knew that finding a

532
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:01,410
high-profile envy was going to be next

533
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:02,040
to impossible

534
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:02,970
so we copped out

535
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:09,150
decided shrug I guess I'm in V then the

536
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:10,919
statement is an excellent encapsulation

537
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:12,120
of the effectiveness of this between

538
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,429
police force Ernest Hemingway once wrote

539
00:17:14,429 --> 00:17:17,100
the world is a fine place and worth

540
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,230
fighting for I agree with the second

541
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:19,500
part

542
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,390
despite some clear inconsistencies in

543
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:23,189
this movie the slime the experience of

544
00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:25,260
this movie let's just remove seven cents

545
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:30,570
you know just because yes this is an

546
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:32,880
awesome song a fantastic credit sequence

547
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,740
but I still need to take all of the

548
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,659
showers after watching this movie no

549
00:17:36,659 --> 00:18:00,620
time to watch all of it say my name

550
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:05,070
eizember you're goddamn right you know

551
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:07,080
what crazy is craziest majority rules

552
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:11,460
yeah huh take germs for example germs in

553
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:14,220
eighteenth century no such thing there's

554
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:17,909
a harsh truth to face no way I'm gonna

555
00:18:17,909 --> 00:18:24,960
make it on the outside I will beat you

556
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,270
like a Cherokee drum but you have to

557
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:30,990
know not fear know some day you gonna

558
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:34,350
die the greatest trick the devil ever

559
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:36,960
pulled was convincing the world he

560
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,000
didn't exist
