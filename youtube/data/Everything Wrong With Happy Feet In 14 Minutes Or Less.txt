1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:10,650
30 seconds of snow goes so the song

2
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,179
playing right now is the Beatles golden

3
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,190
slumbers and that song is also used in

4
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,260
the animated anthropomorphize movie sync

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,600
so my question is how one minute and 31

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,010
seconds capture the imagination of

7
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:21,539
animators everywhere it's a nice song

8
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:23,250
for sure carry that weight is right

9
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:23,730
there

10
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:25,320
look this is a perfectly fine family

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,060
film but this is George King Miller this

12
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,500
movie and the sequel distracted that

13
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,179
national treasure from making Mad Max

14
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:31,769
fury road for years and I'm not

15
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:33,120
forgiving it man yes I know he's

16
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,950
Australian and thus they're a national

17
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:36,690
treasure but I'm also claiming him frost

18
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:37,950
dammit let's get this out of the way

19
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:39,540
right up front the music license for

20
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,399
this movie which the right and holy gods

21
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:43,050
of the YouTube heavens would never let

22
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,700
me play much off is pure magic and joy

23
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,469
and puppies and rainbows and warms the

24
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:48,059
cockles of my tiny black heart take your

25
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:49,829
sin removal you damned happiness witches

26
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:53,309
and begone with you cockles remember way

27
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:55,289
back in 2006 when we actually had polar

28
00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:01,050
ice hang justification also the fact

29
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:02,699
that I know it's Nicole Kidman singing a

30
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:04,470
Baratheon Marilyn Monroe version of kiss

31
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:06,360
one of princes most sensual songs is

32
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,979
making me uncomfortable at how much this

33
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:09,510
animated penguin movie is making body

34
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,490
parts other than my feet happy also also

35
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,590
print songs have been used to hook up a

36
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,600
million times before but not like this

37
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,400
kiss ain't an emotional ballad man it's

38
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:23,640
about straight up she literally just

39
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,080
sang the lines you don't need experience

40
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,210
to turn me out the word sex is so dirty

41
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,189
has to change it to egg also this is

42
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:31,200
preceded by like a million different pop

43
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,700
songs which means between the voice

44
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,079
talent the animation budget and the

45
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,610
amount they spent on the song rights by

46
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:37,759
my count this movie must have cost

47
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,720
seventy two billion dollars it's math

48
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,220
people why does everybody in penguin

49
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,140
town standing here Inconvenient heart

50
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,000
shapes stop and watch these two chord

51
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,110
each other shouldn't they still be all

52
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:47,520
horned up and trying desperately to find

53
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,350
their own musical mates also that snow

54
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,700
is way too white when you consider

55
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,500
penguins as a species have yet to invent

56
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,970
indoor plumbing in fact scientists have

57
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,530
said they can identify penguin colonies

58
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,780
from space based on the giant stains on

59
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,180
the ice true story his mom and dad met

60
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,000
in the you

61
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,030
way back where Asian the moms left for

62
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:07,240
the fishing season while the dad stayed

63
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,570
home to do egg time ah kind of like the

64
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:11,920
reverses of the shape of water and

65
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,030
inconvenient happy feet

66
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,200
I get the feeling this is a movie

67
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,910
created almost solely on the premise

68
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:17,140
that baby penguins are the cutest

69
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,430
carbon-based entity in the entire

70
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,750
universe not that I can blame them for

71
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,850
it but I can send them for it we do make

72
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,500
of that little wobbly in the knees huh

73
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,030
protagonist is born with a hindrance

74
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:26,590
that is mocked by his community who will

75
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,150
someday need that characteristic to save

76
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,940
them cliche you're doing there boy I

77
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,890
would be too if I came out of the womb

78
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:34,540
with full abilities to walk talk and

79
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,100
easily communicate with my community

80
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,050
what'd you do with your feet a few

81
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:40,870
thrall Happy's brothers the great Guin

82
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:43,300
does not test us with a lean season why

83
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,950
is Noah going full Braveheart accent

84
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:46,300
here hugh jackman is doing some sort of

85
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,950
Elvis impersonation and Nicole Kidman is

86
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,209
doing her best Marilyn Monroe but are

87
00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:51,430
all these penguins born raised and then

88
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,989
never leave this one community shouldn't

89
00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:54,550
they all speak a very similar dielectric

90
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,770
she's not a little analog I'm gonna talk

91
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:58,150
you know a movie is hitting all the

92
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,500
relevant musical references when it

93
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,550
pulls out the Big Bopper

94
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,810
speaking of which pulling out the Big

95
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:05,799
Bopper is what my college go for not for

96
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:07,390
long if you keep calling them that today

97
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:13,060
we begin with a damn miss viola this is

98
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,440
the most important lesson ever then

99
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,850
shouldn't you make sure your class is

100
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,410
fully attended in public schools man

101
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:18,940
it's not something that I can actually

102
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:26,290
teach then what was the point of this

103
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,150
class position goddamnit miss viola is

104
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,920
way too hyperbolic to be the teacher of

105
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,750
this elementary tonight that one I could

106
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,640
really get jiggy with that even in 2006

107
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,010
this was too dated of a reference that's

108
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:42,610
not even a tune is like really you're

109
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:43,840
gonna call out mumbles for his

110
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,850
syncopated heart tune when mere seconds

111
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,470
ago you were praising some kid for doing

112
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,850
Grandmaster Flash and neither of them as

113
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:50,530
primarily melodic so what gives and

114
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,269
actually that's a scale not a song and

115
00:03:52,269 --> 00:03:53,739
here I thought my music teacher was an

116
00:03:53,739 --> 00:03:54,250
asshole

117
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,980
the penguin without a hot song is hardly

118
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:00,940
opinion at all heart reaming these

119
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,440
penguins doing anyway everyone's just

120
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,000
standing around like a dickhead instead

121
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,230
of hunting or gathering or doing

122
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,760
anything productive this is why you have

123
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,840
to make up stories about your heart

124
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,400
songs to make these assholes interesting

125
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,860
you want to meet the beautiful girls you

126
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,330
will do will make the egg

127
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:15,550
oh yes I'm having a hard time deciding

128
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:16,870
what I'm most disturbed by here that

129
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,400
this child penguin was just asked if he

130
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,930
wants to make the egg that his response

131
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,760
was a very hearty oh yes or that all

132
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,170
this is happening in a movie geared at

133
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,400
families with children I mean I guess

134
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,260
eggs ed classes have to start at some

135
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,580
point but I was hoping it would be at

136
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:30,760
least after the first mole as

137
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,200
artistically inclined as this penguin

138
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,520
colony is even if they've never seen

139
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,630
dancing before how would they not

140
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:36,310
immediately recognize it was a fun thing

141
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,780
that might go along very well with the

142
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:38,920
music they are already singing it's not

143
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,390
like the kid is making fart noises with

144
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,800
its wing Pitts he just Gregory Hines

145
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,390
himself down that's no Bank like he'd

146
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:45,010
been training for years why'd you do an

147
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,720
air flipper boy that's flip sister

148
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,090
flying boys that's me hey this little

149
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:51,190
boy and the fish not with this attitude

150
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,230
though right just eat some humble pie

151
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,580
the Penguins tastes better if they're

152
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,170
terrorized beforehand is this penny wise

153
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,690
and a V informed they blowed me they tie

154
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:00,460
me up they strap me down they take this

155
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,170
pointy thing and they stick it out to me

156
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:03,880
who's doing what to who no I didn't

157
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,440
mumbles new boat I go it was there just

158
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,640
a few seconds ago and I was just

159
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,230
starting to enjoy his eleventh Doctor

160
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:10,720
cosplay oh never mind its back it's

161
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,030
going to see for the first time G's

162
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:15,250
movie puts way more emphasis on penguin

163
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,480
education than is necessary

164
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,860
they spent all that time in school just

165
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,410
to learn how to swim celebratory molting

166
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:23,200
okay so mumbles aloud on the fishing

167
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,580
trip even though he didn't graduate

168
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:25,570
that was the point of all the school

169
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:27,550
then also the movie plainly said only

170
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:29,200
the moms usually leave for the fishing

171
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,760
season and that was in the winter so why

172
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,900
are any of them going out on this

173
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,700
expedition grant and I'm no penguin

174
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,350
expert I'll leave that to Morgan Freeman

175
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,450
and Benedict Cumberbatch but penguins do

176
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:39,280
only have two eyes in the front right

177
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,780
because somehow this entire group of

178
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,520
them facing the ocean managed to get out

179
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,780
of the way as mumbles falls down this

180
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,580
slope this is delightful and all but are

181
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,960
none of these assholes hungry they're

182
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,640
here to catch fish right this doesn't

183
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,080
get an immediate flipper to the beak

184
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,280
summer of 69

185
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,440
donkey fish missionary to the South Pole

186
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,450
the hell movie I brought my kids to this

187
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:01,860
thing mumbles survives this and this

188
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:05,410
graduation infatuation illumination did

189
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:06,880
Fat Joe really need to be in this movie

190
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,530
I mean they really could have recycled

191
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:10,600
Adam Sandler's Cajun man bit please tell

192
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,410
me they're not gonna play the entire

193
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:14,900
Live Aid sent everybody

194
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,910
leave Jesus Christ these bullies bully

195
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,380
so hard it's like they came directly

196
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,570
from a Stephen King novel Gloria wait

197
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:22,280
they straight up abandoned his ass like

198
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,990
everyone agreed that mumble was useless

199
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:25,460
to the group because he couldn't sing

200
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,139
and they left him out here to like die

201
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:29,780
ah burst the seal mom will clearly

202
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,130
attended the Prometheus School of

203
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:33,380
swimming away from things any thigh

204
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,910
robber but damn it why do penguins

205
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:36,350
always have to be the comic relief this

206
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:38,300
movie already has penguins thank you

207
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,919
coming tall boy what you've got

208
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:40,759
something better

209
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:43,430
yes he does like find his colony for one

210
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:45,080
but sure why not head off with

211
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,820
culturally appropriated Robin Williams

212
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,400
here to a party instead

213
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,020
you like to party I'd remove all the

214
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,580
sins if the next shot was of mobile

215
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,530
doing lines of snow off the moon's ass

216
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:55,810
[Music]

217
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:59,300
you guys are soft in the head okay geez

218
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,500
that escalated quickly

219
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,180
I guess screw these guys for politely

220
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,800
refusing to dance further your people

221
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,289
wanting something me

222
00:07:06,289 --> 00:07:08,090
this goes on for some time look I know

223
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:08,870
we have to stretch this

224
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,130
fish-out-of-water story to

225
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:11,419
feature-length but it's already well

226
00:07:11,419 --> 00:07:13,280
past that so do we really need this much

227
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,930
filler of the downhill shenanigans this

228
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:16,610
movie is so spectacularly gorgeous that

229
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,050
at times I wonder if it might actually

230
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:19,729
deserve that Oscar at one also I'm

231
00:07:19,729 --> 00:07:21,199
pretty sure these assholes caused this

232
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,820
massive avalanche and not only do they

233
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,919
not care I'm pretty sure they're into it

234
00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:26,449
does this have to do with anything in

235
00:07:26,449 --> 00:07:27,710
this movie I'm starting to wonder if

236
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:29,449
I've wandered into a 2001 style

237
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,770
alternate dimension where the movie

238
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:32,360
about a misfit penguin with dance skills

239
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,340
becomes a meditation on the impact of

240
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:43,789
humanity honest way stood or overused in

241
00:07:43,789 --> 00:07:44,990
this movie by the way something about

242
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,699
its performance as simple as I didn't

243
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:52,430
show more it's at this point in the

244
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,479
movie where you start wondering exactly

245
00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:55,310
what dose of hallucinogens the writers

246
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,510
were using during the script phase

247
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,760
determining it was at least 13% too hot

248
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,340
I will retire now to my couch of

249
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:05,180
Perpetual Indulgence okay ladies I guess

250
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,010
we are adding group sex to the list of

251
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:08,419
things I have to explain to my kids

252
00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:10,070
tonight he'll produce this thing Larry

253
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:12,830
Flynt nothing ceases oh you gotta do is

254
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,599
sing I thought it was the fishing season

255
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:16,789
right isn't that why mumbles cohort got

256
00:08:16,789 --> 00:08:17,900
sent to the sea in the first place

257
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,370
dammit this should be a very simple

258
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:21,530
timeline to follow these four goons are

259
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:23,180
singing Bowie's demands I'll make love

260
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,370
to you for Gloria's affection but if she

261
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:26,840
likes their heart song which one does

262
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,280
she get wet not to mention that every

263
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,560
singing a heart song at everyone so is

264
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,440
this basically a key party turn him turn

265
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,090
around wow I guess Gloria wants to

266
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:36,620
reenact my regular Wednesday night so

267
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,390
everything's good now did mumble really

268
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,500
do anything different he's been dancing

269
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,180
for Gloria this entire fucking time but

270
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:44,750
this works from the spot and now we have

271
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,300
this uprising nobody's really thought it

272
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,950
could suddenly become webbed Footloose

273
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:50,830
without me noticing and movies wrong

274
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,450
fought on friends lead us into your easy

275
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,870
ways make it great again happy feet

276
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,730
can't cause a famine I think it comes

277
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:00,950
from outside way beyond the ice well

278
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:02,780
that's quite a leap considering all he

279
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,160
knows is it some bird claimed to be

280
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,780
abducted and there was a strange machine

281
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,100
the fell into the water I'm not sure how

282
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,510
mumbo connected the environmental doubts

283
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:10,070
to the food shortage bug message it's

284
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:11,870
got a message I guess if we are devout

285
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:13,670
sincere in our praise the fish will

286
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,470
return I guess Memphis is a big Joel

287
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:18,650
Steen fan just doesn't make any sense

288
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:20,540
script margin note accidentally gets

289
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,070
included in final draft the thing about

290
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:23,540
his neck it's way too tight what

291
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,100
Lovelace has been wearing this for a

292
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,660
presumably long-ass time so why is it

293
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,400
just now joking him I know he's getting

294
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,170
progressively fatter but that soft

295
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:31,820
plastic that would be expanding with his

296
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,830
neckline also doesn't he usually had a

297
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:35,210
harem around him did they all step out

298
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:37,240
for a smoke break at the exact same time

299
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,830
swim in and it just got caught around

300
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,150
your neck either mumble should be a

301
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:43,010
professional charade guesser or movie

302
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:44,420
needed to yada-yada us through this

303
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,860
quickly to get them where they need to

304
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,120
go I'm guessing it's that second thing

305
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,650
did he just run into the camera

306
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:50,720
capturing the shot does that mean that

307
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,820
this is an animated found footage you

308
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:53,720
know I really should keep my mouth shut

309
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,860
I'm pretty sure I just wrecked her

310
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,720
actively gave some studio exec the idea

311
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,240
for 2007 Surf's Up dammit what are you

312
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,280
doing here and more importantly how are

313
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,290
you doing here seriously did Gloria find

314
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:05,150
him when no one in his original colony

315
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:07,070
even knew about Lovelace and even if she

316
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:08,480
could have gotten a Lovelace's place no

317
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,800
one was there to tell her about the game

318
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,240
of charades position that happened to

319
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,100
point him in this direction it's not you

320
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:13,850
it's me

321
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:15,980
I'm just not up for a serious

322
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,420
relationship right now I swear to God

323
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,610
this movie is 89 percent filler can we

324
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:20,960
skip this part at least the dance

325
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,880
sequences have better camerawork it's a

326
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,890
little Nana Tootsie for my taste

327
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:30,680
oh cool protagonist fight before the

328
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,150
climax of the movie cliche does this

329
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,440
mean we're almost done do they not

330
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,480
realize Lovelace is literally dying like

331
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,130
is it really that big of a deal to try

332
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:38,540
and remove the plastic even if it's

333
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,880
temporarily painful catchy a person is

334
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,430
little

335
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:43,860
why they've really been thing in that

336
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:44,640
pie

337
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,350
I'm down with saving the environment but

338
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,940
laying it on a bit thick here isn't

339
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,530
there a way to make the same point about

340
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:51,210
human and DIF without preaching it ass

341
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:52,710
like we're evil this movie makes the

342
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:55,680
Lorax look subtle no no my mopey movie

343
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,600
moment mostly moans morosely damn it

344
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,980
this movie is freaking gorgeous I

345
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,720
couldn't it also bother to be good hey

346
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,340
get your Paramount out of my Warner

347
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,990
Brothers house lovely it's not dead

348
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:04,350
already

349
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,910
he's been steadily choking for the last

350
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,500
several days so much so that he can't

351
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,970
talk walked across the blizzard

352
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:10,890
landscape and hang by this buoy and now

353
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:11,910
it's pretty much drowned

354
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,110
he's like the penguin version of

355
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:14,880
Rasputin these orcas deciding to

356
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,230
conveniently play with their food and

357
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:18,000
therefore free Lovelace is convenient of

358
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,190
course a massive ship comes through this

359
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:21,780
abandoned graveyard of a port in

360
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,910
Antarctica this very moment and it makes

361
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,500
zero noise until it's right on top of

362
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,150
mumbles team hey remember when this

363
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,680
movie was about mumbles and ability to

364
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,150
fit in because he liked to dance well

365
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:32,070
neither does this movie humble mumbo

366
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:33,810
bumbles and stumbles then tumbles and

367
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:35,160
fumbles through the propeller as it

368
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,080
rumbles but somehow doesn't get jumbled

369
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,300
or crumble and so I show bumble my

370
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,920
there's no way you didn't see all this

371
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,150
when he exited that tunnel about a

372
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,950
minute ago also is there some senior

373
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:45,450
waiting that he was unconscious all the

374
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:46,860
way until the moment of walking out here

375
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,090
surely there were already many

376
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:49,500
interactions with humans to get him

377
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,210
ready to be in this habitat right hang

378
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,400
on mumbo washed-up and in Australia

379
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,390
that's hard enough to believe

380
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:57,480
considering its 2,500 goddamn miles away

381
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,430
from an architect but now movies saying

382
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:01,170
he's in Florida might even include this

383
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:03,390
dramatic planetary unzoom if it's gonna

384
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,980
confuse your narrative this much movie

385
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,990
what the hell here's an extra 20 sins

386
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:09,240
for all the geographical yada yada where

387
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,590
did all these people suddenly come from

388
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:11,760
if you give it a few minutes for the

389
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,830
word to get around the zoo sure as many

390
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,330
people might show up but we're this many

391
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:16,890
people already in the penguin exhibit

392
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:18,660
but somehow not already looking at the

393
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,130
Penguins I know this is supposed to be a

394
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,900
scene of emotional Redemption but I

395
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,370
can't help thinking this feels more like

396
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:24,960
marky-mark jerking off for the dude the

397
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,600
truck toward the end of Boogie Nights

398
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,700
and now mumbles yada yada this way back

399
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,320
home - what exactly are we supposed to

400
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,460
believe happened here that the world

401
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,200
found a dancing penguin and instead of

402
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,790
commercializing it or giving it its own

403
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:36,450
reality show

404
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:37,980
it took him back to Antarctica to let

405
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,150
him find his old stomping ground

406
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,800
everything cool here baby

407
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,780
you remember Seymour man what was with

408
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:44,160
Brittany Murphy hooking up with rappers

409
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,870
and movies so you're not I guess I never

410
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,640
heard the right song damn it boo me

411
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,230
there is no way Gloria waited for him

412
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:50,850
all this time and this hotbed of sexual

413
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:52,380
energy it's much more likely she would

414
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:53,850
have gone full cast away by now and

415
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:54,259
habit

416
00:12:54,259 --> 00:12:55,879
but this former dentist why the hell did

417
00:12:55,879 --> 00:12:57,499
the amigo stay here this is an emperor

418
00:12:57,499 --> 00:12:58,790
penguin colony right aren't they trying

419
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,350
to kick these guys out before mumble

420
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:04,939
left where's pop what come on I'll show

421
00:13:04,939 --> 00:13:06,589
you you better come take a look at this

422
00:13:06,589 --> 00:13:08,689
cliche Wow Nicole Kidman and Hugh

423
00:13:08,689 --> 00:13:10,609
Jackman in a musical reminds me that 9

424
00:13:10,609 --> 00:13:12,079
and the greatest showmen are things that

425
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,889
exist I know you couldn't hear it likely

426
00:13:15,889 --> 00:13:17,269
because they thought better and removed

427
00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:18,589
it but the subtitles at this moment

428
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,209
clearly say wholly flock and I've

429
00:13:20,209 --> 00:13:21,619
decided to send both this ridiculous

430
00:13:21,619 --> 00:13:23,749
near swear and also not having the snow

431
00:13:23,749 --> 00:13:25,189
balls to leave in it I think you better

432
00:13:25,189 --> 00:13:27,499
dance now so the humans not feed the

433
00:13:27,499 --> 00:13:28,910
Penguins if they didn't dance I know

434
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,859
this is a curiosity but if they flew all

435
00:13:30,859 --> 00:13:32,179
the way to Antarctica don't you think

436
00:13:32,179 --> 00:13:33,829
these assholes would just you know give

437
00:13:33,829 --> 00:13:34,459
him some fish

438
00:13:34,459 --> 00:13:36,169
sure just a few seconds ago they didn't

439
00:13:36,169 --> 00:13:37,609
even know how to dance but now somehow

440
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:38,839
they have the entire routine

441
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:40,729
choreographed are they trying to tell us

442
00:13:40,729 --> 00:13:42,589
something so what's the problem among

443
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:43,819
other things we are messing with their

444
00:13:43,819 --> 00:13:44,929
food chain we have got to do something

445
00:13:44,929 --> 00:13:48,169
about it yes this is exactly how humans

446
00:13:48,169 --> 00:13:49,369
would react to these phenomena by

447
00:13:49,369 --> 00:13:50,569
inferring that animals were

448
00:13:50,569 --> 00:13:51,709
communicating a very specific

449
00:13:51,709 --> 00:13:53,809
environmental concern oh sweet baby

450
00:13:53,809 --> 00:13:55,970
penguin Jesus and just like that the

451
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:57,470
climate change and mass extinction were

452
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,999
no more because a bunch of penguins went

453
00:13:58,999 --> 00:14:00,410
to tap school don't ever say Hollywood

454
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:02,329
never offers real solutions dude I don't

455
00:14:02,329 --> 00:14:04,249
care if they have one too Stanley Cups

456
00:14:04,249 --> 00:14:05,629
in the last three years this is some

457
00:14:05,629 --> 00:14:11,210
rampant over celebration

458
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:13,670
we'll know how our dinner I never saved

459
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:16,040
anything for the Sweetback hello chosen

460
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,710
trouble looks like we'll have to send

461
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:22,850
someone down Wow its purpose it

462
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:25,580
creativeness purpose it connects us

463
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:29,270
swept up by the great currents he was

464
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:33,380
carried endlessly across vast oceans the

465
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:35,120
sea was angry that day my friends

466
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,670
the couple has found one now the mother

467
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:40,840
sees her chick for the first time I'm a

468
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,370
particular kind of guy the kind of guy

469
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:50,960
who needs his own space so enormous it

470
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,920
feels all body it must escape you

471
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,280
explode so we're just done with phrasing

472
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:01,230
right that's not a thing anymore

473
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:10,740
[Music]

474
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:13,860
