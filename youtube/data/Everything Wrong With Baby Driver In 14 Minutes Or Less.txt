00:00:08,059 --> 00:00:10,679
forty-eight seconds of logos strolling

00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:12,540
synchronized mask lifting maybe a nice

00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,429
visual flourish but seasoned criminals

5
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:16,199
put that down way before anyone gets a

6
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:18,060
chance to spot their faces also this

group of thieves are great they found

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,150
the one area in Atlanta where there

9
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,130
isn't any traffic that's some good high

10
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:27,900
scouting right there I was going to go

11
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,189
with my usual way too nitpicky

12
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:30,869
observation here but seeing the obvious

13
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:32,460
Joey in the scene put together by the

14
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,020
music the actor whose name I can't

15
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,760
pronounce and Edgar Wright I'm not gonna

16
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,840
sit off dry wiping we would not be

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,160
hearing this from outside the building

18
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,899
you see fast in the Furious this is how

19
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:47,489
you film a car doing a stunt I'm gonna

20
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:49,230
knock another sent off and retroactively

21
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:50,340
Lee add one to the Fast and Furious

22
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,320
franchise somehow I mean this is

23
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,030
probably the morning the bank was open

24
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,530
and there were customers in there but

25
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,449
we're in Atlanta can you speed to 80 at

26
00:00:57,449 --> 00:00:59,280
this hour this automotive shell game is

27
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,230
supremely fun and clever but the chances

28
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:02,730
of two other red cars that look similar

29
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,559
from above with the exact same pink

30
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,540
color exact same Sun roofs and exact

31
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,549
same wear and tear happening to drive by

32
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:10,320
at just the right moment is about the

33
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,460
same as the chances no one in the

34
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:12,689
comments will complain that we take this

35
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:16,530
all just a tad bit too seriously sure

36
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:18,030
this might work to get one car to the

37
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:19,740
center exactly why did the other car

38
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,180
slow down to stay even with them that

39
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,560
third car would have been long gone by

40
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,909
the time baby got back up to speed as

41
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:25,229
they ditch this ride

42
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:26,909
surely to be found by cops later now

43
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:28,560
might be a good time to count each place

44
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,090
baby left a beautiful on glove

45
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,009

freaking car seriously look at that it's

50
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:42,930
like he's purposely printing each finger

51
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:44,930
just so the police can have a full set

52
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:47,640
this building that simulates a road with

53
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,380
a double yellow line up it is so clever

54
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,000
and beautiful it had to be mentioned but

55
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,500
if we stop every time Edgar Wright does

56
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,909
something visually clever or beautiful

57
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:55,590
we'd be here till the Avatar sequels

58
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,210
come out so here's a sent off for this

start recording how does she know there

didn't stop him though cuz I was just

blinded by the balls on that kid yeah

about you these days I'm not surprised

Halloween mask that was part of the plan

but why are they finding out about this

103
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:25,870
just now in fact since doc is the one

104
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:26,860
setting up this heist

105
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,300
why didn't he already have the Michael

00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,310
Myers masks the plan is so meticulously

107
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,810
thought-out I'm surprised doc even

108
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:32,950
allows the robbers to buy their own

109
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:38,920
masks who even is this guy we supposed

110
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,570
to believe he's just a bystander who

111
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:42,459
happens to have military experience who

112
00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:43,780
happens to have a loaded automatic

00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,190
weapon hiding in the front seat with a

114
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:47,320
safety off also even if he had time to

115
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,870
prep fine was the handgun still stow and

116
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,250
why was he parked in the back of a

117
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,050
parking lot like this this car seat

118
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:54,910
chest buckle is already unlatched which

119
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,190
means either bad job by mama or bad job

00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,600
by movie we know better than to blame

121

mama this one's on you movie it's almost

for this job how did these guys even get

124
00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:09,640
recommended wait a second let me get

125
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,050
this straight you execute a guy for

126
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,489
accidentally leaving a shotgun behind

127
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:13,959
and in doing so you leave bloody

128
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:15,820
fingerprints on the car and a bloody

129
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,530
blanket hanging out of the trunk for any

130
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:19,930
passers-by to see I already much also

131
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,730
how do you not know that trunk didn't

132
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,950
shut even just by sound everyone knows

133
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,810
when a trunk is fully shut that car had

134
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:27,280
more open trunk than elephant on

135
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,200
antihistamines it's Debbie

keep your hands off my recorder there is

139
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:38,919
no universe in which a pair of

140

standard-issue iPod headphones stretches

141
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,610
that far between two people except of

142
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:43,960
course the universe where a romantic

143
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,880
laundromat scene is needed Joseph wants

144

baby to get a job delivering pizzas

145
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,570
which is fine this is the only thing he

146

thinks baby can do or is this the only

00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,200
the joke that his driving skills get it

150
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,090
there quick but the actual drive isn't

151
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:02,650
really the part that takes a long unless

152
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,300
baby is also driving the oven this is

153

Lilly James is captivating in this movie

155
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,460
but her character is written with

156
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,590
absolutely zero agency the women in this

157
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,090
movie seemed to only exist in relation

158
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:18,310
to what the men need and have characters

159
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:20,229
as thin as CG Matt Damon in the last

160
00:05:20,229 --> 00:05:22,390
half-hour over the Martian oh no no no

161
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:25,060
why are you telling me it's as if Edgar

162
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,039
Wright heard that last sin and wrote one

163
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,870
more line just to prove my point sheesh

164
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,660
so go inside take note of the number of

165
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,550
cameras and positions I know that doc

166
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,080
just showed how much power he has over

167
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,030
baby but does he seriously not have

168
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:38,560
anyone else who can take notes about the

169
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,510
post office doc made a point to say he

170
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:42,280
never uses the same crew twice but I

171
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,229
guess that doesn't mean he can't mix and

172
00:05:44,229 --> 00:05:45,789
match from other crews from time to time

173
00:05:45,789 --> 00:05:54,520
pick away buddy

174
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,560
darling plays the that guy game so the

175
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,090
buddy has to ask who the hell that guy

176
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:59,020
is together

177
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,430
robbed you the guy that called you a

178
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,600
whore the guy that looked at you funny

179
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,260
that's funny if buddy is so prone to

180
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,490
killing people after stuff like that

181
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:08,140
then why is Darlene talking about

182
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,490
murdering bats in front of baby

183
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:11,080
maybe we should infer that she always

184
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,060
asked him to do that I can't believe

185
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,800
she's so Cavalier to discuss it right

186
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,450
now just because she thinks baby won't

187
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:18,310
say anything even darling here only

188
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:20,020
exists in relationship to buddy her

189
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:22,000
tattoo literally says his for pete's

190
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,910
sake let's go okay so bath just killed

191
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:26,260
the convenience store clerk to steal

192
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,640
some gum something that would have been

193
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,770
easy to do without killing anyone and it

194
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:31,330
establishes once and for all that bass

195
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:34,360
is a psychopath but is he stupid too the

196
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,040
store has cameras and he was in that

197
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,900
store without a mask and while we're at

198
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,190
it it looks like the clickers behind

199
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,660
some late-night bulletproof glass or

200
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:41,530
whatever if

201
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:43,060
Batz has the capability of shooting the

202
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,740
clerk somehow how did nobody in the car

203
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,660
hear it as the smoking pigs

204
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:49,000
never mind that Baptist partners had no

205
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,770
idea he's going to start shooting but

206
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:52,270
once they do realize it they are

207
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,250
outnumbered and using handguns against

208
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,750
guys with automatic weapons yet the

209
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,420
entire crew survives does this guy doing

210
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,220
nobody knew he was alive and he thought

211
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,600
the best course of action was to make a

212
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,220
run for towards the people who just

213
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,680
killed everybody the Freeman and aren't

214
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,730
there plenty of cars he could have

215
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:07,900
gotten into that we're already running

216
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,490
so what's your real name

217
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:11,980
darling Monica okay so we were allowed

218
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:14,380
to discuss news why would darling tell

219
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,150
bats her real name didn't she want this

220
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:17,800
guy killed a minute ago why doesn't she

221
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,169
tell him Goff already that stop stop

222
00:07:20,169 --> 00:07:20,800
stop

223
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,200
Oh in course of all the gin joints and

224
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,730
all the atlanta's of the world bats

225
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:26,740
wants to go into this King diner and

226
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,240
Debra's working at this time of night

227
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,070
haven't we seen her working day shifts

228
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:30,700
all this time

229
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,770
I guess baby has his don't talk to me or

230
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:34,300
you'll get exposed as someone I care

231
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,740
about which will put you in danger face

232
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,450
off because Debra instinctively knows

233
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:38,950
not to say anything to him as he walks

234
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:41,530
in so they go through all this just to

235
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:43,330
order some cokes don't even drink them

236
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,580
and leave what kind of manufacturer plot

237
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,380
bolt is this bat said he was super

238
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,910
hungry I guess now he's gonna do a

239
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:50,620
Southern tradition and hit up Waffle

240
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:54,100
House sir crystal somehow baby is able

241
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,900
to stop this true psycho from punching

242
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,190
him in the face and shooting up the

243
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,840
diner I disagree with this film's

244
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,890
portrayal of what would have actually

245
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:01,750
happened well you contacts was cops that

246
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:05,169
I know they were my cops is there any

247
00:08:05,169 --> 00:08:06,370
reason why you wouldn't share that

248
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:07,990
information with your crew and another

249
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:09,520
thing if doc has these comps on the

250
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,110
payroll then why can't he get somebody

251
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:12,760
to just hand deliver the weapons to the

252
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,290
crew why set up this whole thing in the

253
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:15,460
middle of nowhere and waste everybody's

254
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,590
time is that true they fired first

255
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:19,600
despite everyone's body language in the

256
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,520
scene and terrible poker faces doc

257
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,020
believes the story enough to continue

258
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:23,590
with the heist

259
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:25,930
despite justified paranoia and why is

260
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:27,460
this heist so goddamn important right

261
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,140
now anyway it's not like the post office

262
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,970
or the money order is going anywhere

263
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:32,380
even if doc is convinced the police

264
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,610
won't figure out who killed their boys

265
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:35,680
why risk it now when you can just as

266
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:42,729
easily do it next week why would you

267
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:44,560
listen to this thing here of all places

268
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,510
and man that tape recorder sure is

269
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,950
awesome for being in his pocket and

270
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:49,300
picking up doc luck he's speaking

271
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,190
directly into the microphone baby who is

272
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:53,050
a world-class getaway driver who sees

273
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:54,710
every detail in front of him when he's

274
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:57,130
car only notices buddy when we notice it

275
00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:00,290
discussed this oh you mean the recorder

276
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,850
baby would absolutely never leave out of

277
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,440
his possession unless it was convenient

278
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,270
for the block yes let's discuss that

279
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:07,490
also bats saw baby li and he thought

280
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:08,960
I'll go to his room first

281
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,970
trying to figure out this scenario we

282
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:13,250
saw bats wake up but the first instinct

283
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,290
was not to track baby down but rummage

284
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:17,180
through his room and maybe he heard baby

285
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,620
stupidly playing that tape recorder

286
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,150
earlier and knew he needed to do

287
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:22,250
something about it but maybe I'm so sure

288
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,570
it would still be there maybe your new

289
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:24,980
buddy was going down to catch him but

290
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:27,020
buddy seemed super surprised to see bats

291
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,430
show up so it doesn't appear they

292
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:32,570
coordinated this Amy your call decision

293
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:34,970
and we know this thing or not I also

294
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:36,680
love how this recorder absolutely nails

295
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,570
the start time on that phrase each and

296
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:46,100
every time that brain isn't that the

297
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,200
waitress from the diner I would believe

298
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,880
bats remembering this name but I'm not

299
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,800
buying darling remembering it bats was

300
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,940
the one who bothered to check out the

301
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,710
name tag and say the name out loud and

302
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:56,240
while the movie made a big deal out of

303
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,890
showing her nametag it's not like the

304
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,150
whole crew was paying attention that

305
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:01,130
much I'm your driver tomorrow I'm

306
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:03,230
driving okay well we'll just forget all

307
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,460
these tapes man that you were clearly

308
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,230
trying to escape earlier we can see now

309
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,640
that you're just a struggling musician

310
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,890
who knows how to drive fast so sorry for

311
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:11,570
the misunderstanding that's how bad guy

312
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:13,880
stuff works right geez baby communicates

313
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,800
to yet another person what he needs them

314
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,450
to do simply by looking at them this

315
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,310
postal clerk gets the entire message she

316
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:21,080
needs from a look and a head shake and

317
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,790
does she recognize baby from his visit

318
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,140
the other day despite him wearing

319
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:26,270
sunglasses and how convenient she's not

320
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,920
in the post office right now and is just

321
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,970
getting to work holy crap utility truck

322
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:33,440
parked outside a post office with

323
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:40,700
stabbing Ron's ex machina

324
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,200
well wait a second what button did he

325
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,970
just hit before sending bats to a pole

326
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:47,250
dancing lesson passenger airbag off I

327
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,690
could send it for thinking that somehow

328
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:49,890
the airbag would have made any

329
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:51,210
difference with his impalement but the

330
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:52,890
real sin is thinking the audience would

331
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:54,330

339
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:06,960

after what you done to me wait is that a

375
00:12:36,259 --> 00:12:39,949
cue to come in though I'll deal with the

376
00:12:39,949 --> 00:12:41,569
cops did someone order a heart

377
00:12:41,569 --> 00:12:43,610
transplant how on God's green earth did

378
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:45,410
the same guy who said this could break

379
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:46,939
your legs and tell everyone you love all

380
00:12:46,939 --> 00:12:48,799
the sudden become mr. self-sacrifice I

381
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:50,299
might buy that it lets him go

382
00:12:50,299 --> 00:12:52,429
but put himself in danger who he gives

383
00:12:52,429 --> 00:12:53,959
no character motivation for that in the

384
00:12:53,959 --> 00:12:56,329
slightest that's not the cop so buddy

385
00:12:56,329 --> 00:12:57,649
knew that baby would show up to the

386
00:12:57,649 --> 00:12:59,449
hideout what gave him that idea the

387
00:12:59,449 --> 00:13:01,040
script there's no way he thinks doc

388
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,100
would be okay with baby showing up here

389
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:06,230
car survives this okay two things here

390
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:07,819
either he got out and baby should have

391
00:13:07,819 --> 00:13:08,209
seen it

392
00:13:08,209 --> 00:13:09,829
or he didn't get out and he should be

393
00:13:09,829 --> 00:13:11,899
dead there's no scenario by which buddy

394
00:13:11,899 --> 00:13:13,129
gets out of this and is able to get the

395
00:13:13,129 --> 00:13:14,749
drop on baby but that's what the movies

396
00:13:14,749 --> 00:13:18,459
gonna tell us villain won't die cliche

397
00:13:18,459 --> 00:13:20,600
movie continues to be kind of baby

398
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,549
whenever he needs to escape a situation

399
00:13:22,549 --> 00:13:24,319
just a reminder none of the bullets that

400
00:13:24,319 --> 00:13:26,119
made any of those bullet holes even

401
00:13:26,119 --> 00:13:29,480
grazed either of our leads through my

402
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:33,049
purse right at me and he actually said

403
00:13:33,049 --> 00:13:34,459

404
00:13:34,459 --> 00:13:36,170

406
00:13:38,299 --> 00:13:40,160

417
00:14:00,529 --> 00:14:02,240
