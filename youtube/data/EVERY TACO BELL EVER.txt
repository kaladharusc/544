Yo, what should I get?

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:04,960
Oh it's easy.

4
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,140
Just combine any words you can think of and it'll be on the menu.

5
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:13,760
Hey. Uh, could I get a Doritos Locos Tacos Mountain Dew Supreme, please?

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:14,260

'Sup Jebrony?

17
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,040
I think our Taco Bell's broken.

18
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:48,260
Oh, no. On the contrary, my dude, the Taco Bell's fully functional, but only skater dudes named Kyle can hear it.

19
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:49,360
Wait, for real?

20
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,140
Yeah.

21
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,820
YOU READY MY DUDE?

22
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,520
Yeah, false alarm. Sorry Kyles.

23
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,520
Just teaching the new guy all about the Bell.

24
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:05,320
Oh. All good man. KYLES! ROLL OUT!

25
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:09,840
Every fake meat ever

27
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,620
Thanks man.

28
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:13,720
No problem.

29
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:17,340
Hey, live más.

30
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,940
What did you just say to me?

31
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:22,200
Uh... live más?

32
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,560
Oh my god.

33
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,520
You're right.

34
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,940
Thank you

35
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:33,990
You know I've been so brainwashed, by the system society has trapped, me in droning on day, by

36
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:38,460
day, trapped in a cubicle, slowly waiting to die!

37
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,460
I haven't been living más.

38
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,450
I've been living menos.

39
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:45,190
But you know what?

40
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:52,270
No longer! Because I'm quitting my job and I'm moving to a Commune in Venezuela!

41
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:55,720
You, sir, are an enlightened human being.

42
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:01,780
Thank you so más.

43
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:02,980
Okay.

44
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:05,760
But, Taco Bell's not real mexican food

45
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,620
I actually heard taco bell is the healthiest fast food you can ever eat.

46
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:10,180
I don't know about that...

47
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:14,060
I'd definitely be skeptical and, maybe, do some research before believing it.

48
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:14,680
Hi.

49
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,700
What's up?

50
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:19,140
Is Taco Bell the healthiest fast food you can get?

51
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,160
Yeah, sure.

52
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:26,940
*so proud of their food choices*

53
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,340
I'll have five thousand tacos.

54
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,320
Do you wanna make it a meal?

55
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,220
Hell yes.

56
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,200
Alright.

57
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,340
Quick tip, order fresca style.

58
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,920
Order.... 420? hehe.

59
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,020
Yeah, thanks man.

60
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,140
Yeah, do you want any hot sauce?

61
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:38,980
Uh, no thanks.

62
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,700
Okay, what type of hot sauce do you want?

63
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,060
Uh, no, I don't want hot sauce.

64
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,060
Uh, how many hot sauces?

65
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:54,980
I don't...want hot sauce.

66
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:59,780
I like that the hot sauces are like fortune cookies.

67
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:06,060
Okay, guys a couple years, ago, we started selling breakfast at our Taco Bells, and IT F**KING KILLED! What else can we serve?
