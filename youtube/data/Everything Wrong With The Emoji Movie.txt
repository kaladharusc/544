1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:10,839
forty seconds of three Sony logos the

2
00:00:10,839 --> 00:00:12,519
world we live in

3
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:14,169
seriously are all animated movies

4
00:00:14,169 --> 00:00:15,999
particularly the ones required to begin

5
00:00:15,999 --> 00:00:17,920
with disembodied narration I mean I've

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,090
guess they've got a voice actor and a

7
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:21,130
mic and say what the hell hey which one

8
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:22,150

9
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:23,619
texting to make and throw this paper

10
00:00:23,619 --> 00:00:25,119
airplane goddammit if you're gonna be a

11
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:26,710
part of this cliched image of current

12
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:28,060
adolescence you better get the hell back

13
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:30,220
onto tinder that's my home tech stop

14
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:30,759
with us

15
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:32,590
wait why isn't it called emoji bill or

16
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:35,110
emoji would this assumes all text lives

17
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:36,760
here but there are no numbers or letters

18
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,190
to be found here each of us does one

19
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:41,770
thing and we have to nail it every time

20
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:43,629
yeah but why does the fortune cookie get

21
00:00:43,629 --> 00:00:44,980
the crack wise and the elephant can

22
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:46,570
later joke with the laughing guy about a

23
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:48,039
text the rules of this place make no

24
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:50,110
fucking sense Merry Christmas

25
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:52,629
it's still September Tim first off why

26
00:00:52,629 --> 00:00:53,800
does the Christmas tree have an actual

27
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,140
name and why does it be Tim and does it

28
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,760
matter that it's September this fortune

29
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,379
cookie asshole has clearly never seen a

30
00:00:59,379 --> 00:01:01,539
retail store after August Cryer always

31
00:01:01,539 --> 00:01:04,450
has to cry has to or decides to and why

32
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:06,340
exactly yes I know it's the entire

33
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:07,420
foundation of what we're going to

34
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,160
loosely call a plot here but a few

35
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,410
seconds ago you said for the faces the

36
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:13,780
pressure is on why would the pressure be

37
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:14,980
on if they have no choice and

38
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,480
furthermore why does it matter what they

39
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,550
do outside of the cubes that's the only

40
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:20,560
time they're required to be on also hang

41
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,600
up not only do the emojis have a fully

42
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,460
functional lottery system but they use

43
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,260
actual money as currency isn't money

44
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:30,220
itself an emoji I know you can't also

45
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:32,110
based on the silly putty appendages will

46
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:33,430
continue to see throughout this travesty

47
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:35,050
pretty sure the audience is the only one

48
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:36,760
who's boned why is he trying on ties

49
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,010
emojis don't work clothes and even if

50
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:40,450
they did are you trying to tell me this

51
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:42,250
untied shoe here would even fit those

52
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,350
tiny feet and this world must be

53
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:46,090
confusing are edible doughnuts a thing

54
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:47,590
here our people tempted to eat these

55
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:50,290
babies what kind of business monkey

56
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:52,390
business you it's been almost 30 seconds

57
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:53,860
since we heard a low-quality punt is

58
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,750
that the time hey my eyes are up here

59
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:56,620
pal

60
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,630
hate what iris numbers his genitals and

61
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:00,190
don't you look at the whole clock when

62
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:01,990
telling the time also how is he not used

63
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:07,000
to this elephant farts elfin parts let's

64
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,720
all laugh at the elephant parts freak

65
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,670
protagonists in a kids movie is bullied

66
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,140
for being different cliche

67
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,960
my parents are total pros parents great

68
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,280
now I have to think about how emojis

69
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,620
reproduce can only identical emojis hook

70
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,240
up to produce the same emoji offspring

71
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,100
and how does that even work looks on

72
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,720
when an eggplant emoji loves a taco

73
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,880
emoji very much whoa I'm a ton of

74
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,200
questions about what just happened here

75
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,970
how do these poop emojis even use the

76
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:32,290
restroom did they just murder one of

77
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:32,709
their own

78
00:02:32,709 --> 00:02:34,209
what were they flushing wooden bathrooms

79
00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:35,590
be like torture chambers for them or

80
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,330
wait did he just birth his son our

81
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:38,800
bathrooms their birthing centers should

82
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,870
we wash our hands ha ha ha ha you movie

83
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:46,300
come on dad if you really think you're

84
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:46,690
ready

85
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:48,220
so in this universe the parents get to

86
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,870
decide who goes on the job should the

87
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,070
hiring and firing be done by the

88
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:55,330
scanning company we are all of these new

89
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:57,250
emojis starting work on the same day the

90
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,810
hell they replaced a huge chunk of their

91
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,370
workforce overnight all of these cubes

92
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:02,410
are already full and there's even poop

93
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,360
senior sitting in his so where are these

94
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,250
new assholes supposed to go because I

95
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:09,400
was the original emoji were you because

96
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,420
I'm pretty sure the first group of

97
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,830
emojis were all released at the same

98
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,810
time unless you mean the emoticon but

99
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:15,010
we've already seen that those are

100
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,750
different and considered the elderly in

101
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,700
this universe Plus on this phone you all

102
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,500
probably came pre-installed together so

103
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,030
tell me again why you're in charge

104
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:25,000
there's nothing like getting scammed

105
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,370
for the first time damn movie did you

106
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:28,959
have to make the emojis getting scanned

107
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,220
for the first time creepy in the

108
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,920
nosebleeds I'm standing right here

109
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,260
words hurt yeah but the nose isn't

110
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,090
bleeding so what's the offense here jeez

111
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,320
it's like the writers were looking at a

112
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,820
page of emojis and said hey we haven't

113
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,470
used the nose yet how can we shoot horn

114
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:48,760
in a reference I know the movie needs to

115
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,170
show these assholes doing stuff other

116
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,549
than getting scammed but why the hell

117
00:03:51,549 --> 00:03:53,769
aren't they always in there cute Alex is

118
00:03:53,769 --> 00:03:55,540
not sure how he wants to play this just

119
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,530
because he's scrolling through the

120
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:58,030
options he could be looking for a

121
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,470
specific emoji but this announcer

122
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,880
purports to know his actual thoughts

123
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,470
dammit this movie wants to be inside out

124
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:05,320
so bad we are go format something not

125
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,000
explained and all that explained arising

126
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,680
is how on earth all this getting every

127
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,269
emoji to their cube orienting the

128
00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:12,010
Machine and doing the scan happened so

129
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:13,959
quickly on the user side is there a time

130
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:15,519
distortion does the time flow with a

131
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,140
different rate in the phone is gene

132
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,850
actually Matthew McConaughey is he going

133
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:20,980
to leave his own daughter Oh

134
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:23,140
mr. poop can apparently only speak in

135
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,670
poop related references it's kind of

136
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:25,900
like the dude that works as a personal

137
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:30,540
trainer and that's all he can talk about

138
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,710
elevator platform that got him in the

139
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:37,150
cute can someone tell the movie that

140
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:38,860
these scenes of slow-motion hilarity are

141
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,390
supposed to be used for actual funny

142
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:42,130
moments malfunction

143
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:43,510
so I guess Alex who's supposedly

144
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,010
addicted to using his phone and was

145
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,630
literally just texting is taking a

146
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,160
convenient break from using emojis while

147
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,690
all this plays out right I am a

148
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,310
malfunction technically you're correct

149
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,960
which is the problem with the screen

150
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,370
movie you said at the very beginning

151
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:55,690
that these characters have one job

152
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:59,350
apiece I'm always happy oh right hashtag

153
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:00,610
truth is there an emoji for the

154
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,320
combination of anger eye rolling and

155
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,760
bored them all together because if there

156
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,200
is that should be the text for the rest

157
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,080
of this fucking video movie went to

158
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,550
great pains to show us high five

159
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:11,200
subterfuge to get into the favorites

160
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,360
club so how did gene get in here so

161
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:13,720
easily

162
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,510
welcome to the loser lounge where the

163
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:19,750
emojis who never get used hangout never

164
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,290
used

165
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:22,210
that's eggplant and considering their

166
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:23,830
user as a male who just graduated junior

167
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,570
high there's no way that emoji is left

168
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:28,420
unused they were trying to leave me you

169
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:30,010
what's so important about you they'd

170
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:32,620
send out an entire team of bots the dude

171
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,600
high-five was at the event where gene

172
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,770
fucked up all the machinery of the

173
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,600
emojis but has no clue why they'd wanted

174
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,620
to lead him it's that had better not be

175
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,660
my leftover Chinese food wait is the

176
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,400
abandoned luggage emoji eating actual

177
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,170
leftover Chinese food or is this an

178
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:49,030
emoji of Chinese food and if it's an

179
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,560
emoji of Chinese food does that mean the

180
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,600
Chinese food emoji is also in the losers

181
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,550
lounge and what the fuck is up with the

182
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:56,230
pizza Pete has gotta be an incredibly

183
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,420
popular emoji do you have any idea what

184
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:01,240
it's like to be demoted to this pit of

185
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,520
despair yeah yeah I'm starting to think

186
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:03,820
I do

187
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,560
just find a hacker and get reprogrammed

188
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,900
one of the princess emojis left the

189
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,430
phone altogether I'm sure the hacker

190
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:10,630
that helps her do that could easily

191
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:11,860
reprogram you

192
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:14,350
the names jailbreak why does hi-5 even

193
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:15,760
know any of this did he spend the last

194
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,530
few days in the Wikipedia app studying

195
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:18,700
up on wyldstyle

196
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,440
I mean jailbreak sure they were asleep

197
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,060
on the couch a little while ago but they

198
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,260
definitely would've woken up during this

199
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,390
trip did hi-5 and gene drug these two

200
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:27,580
where is he even storing those some sort

201
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,470
of invisible back pouch hour-hand emojis

202
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:31,570
marsupials and other finger puppets also

203
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:33,130
emojis can someone explain the goddamn

204
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:34,360
rules of this universe

205
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,949
let the Silicon Valley product placement

206
00:06:35,949 --> 00:06:38,050
commits being crackle what kid would

207
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:39,939
have crackle instead of Netflix or HBO

208
00:06:39,939 --> 00:06:41,530
go did he specifically want to watch

209
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:43,090
Jupiter ascending and that was the only

210
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:44,379
service that carried it there are no

211
00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:45,550
barriers to getting in and out of these

212
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,530
apps why isn't this cross-pollination

213
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:49,030
happening all the time it's not like the

214
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:50,469
boundary was way the hell out of the way

215
00:06:50,469 --> 00:06:52,120
just a short walk from the center of

216
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,340
text Ovilus they like him and that's

217
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:57,509
what matters in this life popularity oh

218
00:06:57,509 --> 00:07:00,219
good rather just have a real friend

219
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:02,020
that's right the ping emoji movie is

220
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,400
trying to sneak some serious social

221
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,960
commentary into its narrative just

222
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,430
because one of the six writers has a

223
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:10,360
problem with how Facebook is used to

224
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,550
follow those meds so not only was

225
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:14,199
smiling and watching this camera at the

226
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:15,909
exact time that the bot spotted the Miz

227
00:07:15,909 --> 00:07:18,129
the plan to follow them only just came

228
00:07:18,129 --> 00:07:19,689
to her also nothing about these BOTS

229
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,099
told us that they had cameras in the

230
00:07:21,099 --> 00:07:22,060
first place

231
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:22,990
what else do they do that we're not

232
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:24,580
aware of turnout a liquid metal also

233
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,650
just a reminder that alex has continued

234
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,210
to not use any emojis since the

235
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:29,620
destruction of the pond thinking this

236
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:36,189
place can get a little rough yep you can

237
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:37,389
tell how rough this place is by the

238
00:07:37,389 --> 00:07:39,279
extremely dangerous early 80s hair metal

239
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:42,819
cover band oh geez I thought the

240
00:07:42,819 --> 00:07:44,650
conversation just got dumber

241
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:46,360
Rando pirate troll that for some reason

242
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,159
requires eyeglasses would be excellent

243
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:48,900
at cinemasins

244
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,669
internet trolls just ignore them exactly

245
00:07:51,669 --> 00:07:53,949
our internet trolls inside the piracy

246
00:07:53,949 --> 00:07:56,379
app again I can buy emojis BOTS viruses

247
00:07:56,379 --> 00:07:57,849
and such but aren't internet trolls

248
00:07:57,849 --> 00:07:59,529
actual human beings actually I think I

249
00:07:59,529 --> 00:08:02,580
just answered my own question

250
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,080
wait the bots literally just identified

251
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,699
a virus and did nothing would it take

252
00:08:06,699 --> 00:08:10,580
too much time to eliminate this mother

253
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,750
come the how long the spots have been

254
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,370
easily eliminating fools left and right

255
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:16,080
in this scene alone but the one that

256
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,760
actually spots gene takes as much time

257
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:22,490
to charge his weapon is the death star I

258
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:24,449
should probably give up trying to

259
00:08:24,449 --> 00:08:25,830
understand the dimensional physics of

260
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,360
this world but exactly how did they

261
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,770
navigate sideways but end up falling

262
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,389
downward alright because one of them

263
00:08:30,389 --> 00:08:32,099
needed to land in a candy crush level so

264
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:33,450
we could spend another five minutes on

265
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:34,710
blatant product placement that serves

266
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,779
zero story purpose I have a sugar

267
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:39,570
addiction and it's a very serious finger

268
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:41,490
head that's racist also apparently

269
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:43,320
because James Corden is overweight all

270
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,940
the characters he voices must have some

271
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,529
sort of food addiction I guess he's Jack

272
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:48,450
Black now we have to match up the candy

273
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:49,740
so the gene will drop to the bottom

274
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,570
he'll be seriously includes a game

275
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:53,220
tutorial one third of the way into this

276
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,990
movie and we just now rejoin the real

277
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:57,060
world protagonist who we then won't see

278
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:01,370
again for another thirty minutes I

279
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:03,540
believe in the existence of actual

280
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,580
sentient emojis sooner than I believe an

281
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,050
actual human being would immediately

282
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:13,200
answer a customer service line whoa they

283
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,520
made this way harder than it had to be

284
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,110
when the board started all they had to

285
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:17,640
do was move this yellow to the left to

286
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,470
clear the yellows which would also clear

287
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:21,240
the dropping rats leaving just this blue

288
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,070
to move over and clear the blues two

289
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:25,620
moves with no risk what so maybe I crush

290
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,089
a little you know all these other apps

291
00:09:27,089 --> 00:09:29,160
like WeChat and Facebook took up limited

292
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,170
space even text appleís was small enough

293
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,550
that gene could get to the border in a

294
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,020
matter of minutes but candy crush is

295
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,490
supposed to be the size of a set piece

296
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:37,380
in Lord of the Rings but first we need

297
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,390
to get uploaded to the cloud that's

298
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:41,250
where we'll find the source code to

299
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,380
reprogram you what I don't know if it's

300
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,390
possible to reprogram a fucking emoji by

301
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,920
using a cloud service but I do know that

302
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,420
this is a cheap and convenient excuse to

303
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,310
get them off the phone and into a whole

304
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:51,060
new environment

305
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,580
we're in candy crush ops I know a

306
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,950
shortcut to just dance which is right

307
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:57,690
next to Dropbox where we can get

308
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:00,000
uploaded to the cloud could you be more

309
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,770
product place here also why even worry

310
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:02,970
about a shortcut when it's just like

311
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,890
four blocks down it's not like time or

312
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:06,150
space have any sort of meaning in this

313
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,650
universe anyway and why did they even

314
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:08,970
have to go through an app to get to

315
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:10,650
another app when there are paths to

316
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:12,450
those apps isn't like a city grid with

317
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:14,490
avenues and streets I wanted to see cuz

318
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:17,160
it was my idea you know women are always

319
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,360
coming up with stuff that men are taking

320
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,310
credit for but he's a ping emoji with

321
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:21,900
very little indication he's masculine

322
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,740
does she see a penis that I'm missing

323
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,900
my precious it's as if this movie heard

324
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,310
my earlier joke about Lord of the Rings

325
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:28,720
and then realized there was yet another

326
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,340
pop-culture reference they could cheaply

327
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,230
cram down in there I think we should go

328
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:34,300
our separate ways Mel wait she's

329
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,580
divorcing him now while they're out

330
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,870
looking for their son and how do these

331
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,070
fucking things even get married in the

332
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:41,020
first place and now enough do they

333
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:43,060
procreate this movie finally broke me

334
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,010
with its stupidity add 50 sins to this

335
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:49,600
fucking thing high five even asked

336
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,130
jailbreak about doing this for him sure

337
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:52,960
he told gene that this was his plan but

338
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,100
that was way before they met her just

339
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,570
because she's a hacker doesn't mean you

340
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:57,100
have automatic consent dammit I was

341
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,360
trying to think of a clever way to call

342
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,860
out the impossibility of this stupid

343
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,390
fucking scene but all I saw was a

344
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:03,640
white-hot rage so let's add ass in here

345
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,020
and move on while my systolic blood

346
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,400
pressure still measures within three

347
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:10,240
digits high 5 don't do it this goes on

348
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,820
for some time no matter what we can't

349
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:15,910
turn it on every other app anyone's

350
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:17,590
walked into has already been operational

351
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:18,940
why does this one all of a sudden have

352
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:22,410
to be turned on from the inside

353
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:24,640
even though hi-5 hasn't been shown

354
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,110
obsessively pressing buttons throughout

355
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:27,430
this whole journey this is supposed to

356
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:29,350
provoke a laugh god damn it every app

357
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,790
has been turned on during this trip

358
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,980
including the very loud candy crush but

359
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,210
this is the one that gets the bots

360
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:36,100
attention this movie with everything

361
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,930
that can fuck also in the time that it

362
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,580
took the bots to realize the Just Dance

363
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,230
app was turned on gene and the crew

364
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,460
could easily have made it across this

365
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,260
reasonably sized room to the portal even

366
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:49,000
before the game kicked in ruby includes

367
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,940
two game tutorials come on everybody can

368
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:52,360
dance

369
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,830
apparently this includes emojis because

370
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:55,420
movie once our disbelief so suspended

371
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:58,120
that it pulls a hammy hi-five somehow

372
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,860
advances in the game despite doing none

373
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:03,040
of the moves that it requires nice I

374
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,600
always wondered what that loud sound was

375
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,030
I heard in late July 2017 and now

376
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,650
realize it was several million parents

377
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:09,940
sitting in movie theaters collectively

378
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:15,790
groaning at the scene Christina Aguilera

379
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:17,410
apparently only agreed to do this part

380
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:18,700
if she was allowed to shout all her

381
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,560
lines at the top of her lungs seriously

382
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,390
this movie is like 78 minutes before the

383
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:24,010
credits but there were multiple people

384
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,780
that signed off on this super long dance

385
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,310
sequence that has nothing to do with the

386
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:28,990
rest of this movie god damn it why did

387
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:29,860
this make so much money

388
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,630
also these King BOTS have been flying

389
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:32,950
everywhere is their primary mode of

390
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:34,570
transportation so why do they need to

391
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:36,340
use the game to advance or they could

392
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,470
just shoot those ping laser

393
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:38,640
out of their hands like they've been

394
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:42,030
doing this whole time and that deletion

395
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,740
will provide the steps towards our goal

396
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,150
instead of immediately making everything

397
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:50,640
disappear G is the bot doing rather than

398
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,840
shooting the emojis like they're

399
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,030
supposed to this asshole grabs hi-5 and

400
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,560
does a tandem hans gruber off the

401
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,850
platform and they're all here to get

402
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:58,770
gene anyway so why would even with high

403
00:12:58,770 --> 00:12:59,820
five in the first place

404
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,460
wait where's high five are you kidding

405
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,720
me less than 30 seconds ago you

406
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,920
literally dropped him into the void and

407
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,900
screamed no how are you even asking this

408
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,850
question right now no way we can't go

409
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:10,950
without my five that's my friend down

410
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:12,480
there what about this arrangement led to

411
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,250
high five and gene being friends sure

412
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,380
high five helped him find jailbreak he

413
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,640
was doing that mostly for his own

414
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,710
benefit wait Alex only shuffled two apps

415
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,180
when did Salida just dance

416
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,950
but somehow the science app or whatever

417
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:24,780
that is moved all the way from a

418
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,640
different screen to here and what is

419
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:31,050
that a before we heat one right after

420
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:32,880
the candy crush scenario nerd emoji said

421
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,980
his appointment is for tomorrow it

422
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,270
didn't take them an entire fucking day

423
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:37,590
to go through the tunnels and play the

424
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:39,180
just dance game I mean how hard is it to

425
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,800
prep a timeline that you specifically

426
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,140
mentioned the illegal upgrade you mean

427
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,370
that thing that you somehow have stashed

428
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:45,960
away for this very specific situation

429
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,640
that you could in no way have known was

430
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,120
about to happen

431
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,250
yay a bunch of people are hitting the

432
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,170
promenade I think Eddie might be there

433
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:54,600
too that's perfect movie remembers to

434
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,430
feature this F story about Alex asking a

435
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:58,170
girl out for the fall dance because it

436
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,250
needs a break from the emotional

437
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,750
complexity of the emojis playing a

438
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,970
goddamn dansgame also what fucking kid

439
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:05,250
uses the word promenade did you realize

440
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,470
that on the first emoji set a woman can

441
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:10,380
either be a princess or a bride but wait

442
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:13,410
smiling is a girl mrs. MS a girl plus I

443
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:14,850
thought you just were what you were in

444
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:16,170
the logic of the universe you weren't a

445
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:17,790
princess because you're a girl you're a

446
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,470
princess because you're a princess you

447
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:22,050
know I think you're pretty cool just the

448
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:23,940
way you are um are they gonna start

449
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,890
because if so I'm not sure that would

450
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:27,810
make this movie better or worse okay

451
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:29,070
they got the rope from the magical boat

452
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:31,110
on the Spotify app where they find a

453
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:34,950
fucking winch gene are you instagramming

454
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:36,810
I swear to God movie just eat Sir

455
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:38,700
Patrick Stewart and die kind of sorcery

456
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,530
is this does instagram capture 3d

457
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:42,300
encapsulations of a square mile radius

458
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,640
does mrs. men somehow have memory of all

459
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,040
this she the NiO of her own metrics

460
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,260
sorry it's this movie it's eating my

461
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,270
brain let's go find her

462
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:53,790
together am I supposed to be full of

463
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,380
some sort of emoji emotion here they've

464
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,570
been apart for what 15 minutes why don't

465
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:59,430
you come back to text Appa listen we can

466
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:01,830
talk through our differences okay

467
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:04,080
okay seriously why is smiler in control

468
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,760
of the entire phone the bots are hers

469
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,110
and they apparently control the

470
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,790
functions of every app so why would she

471
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:10,110
have total authority shouldn't the

472
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,760
dictator be embedded into the Settings

473
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,450
app or something

474
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:14,220
also why isn't this upgraded asshole

475
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,200
shooting them right now the entire movie

476
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,460
has been the bots trying to kill gene

477
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,020
and now that he's in their sights

478
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,370
smiler wants to bring them all the way

479
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:22,830
back to text tapas can't get in it's

480
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:24,780
illegal malware and this app is secure

481
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,460
and also incredibly convenient to the

482
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:31,190
block also an email app isn't secured

483
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:33,780
despite eating all that Beckett candy

484
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,580
crush the candy corn is the only item

485
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,530
that hi-5 continues to regurgitate Jean

486
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:39,720
survives this and this book this book

487
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,870
this Bulls this boat this boat this

488
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:45,600
tomfoolery and this bull I'd probably

489
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,910
use the name of a girl I like I've been

490
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,830
all over the phone he's never mentioned

491
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:52,050
a girl the fucking he was just texting

492
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:54,450
with her yesterday what is her name

493
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:58,590
it was Tina Karen March this is this

494
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,240
movie in a nutshell an over long

495
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,710
repetitive joke that wasn't funny in the

496
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:04,770
first place access granted

497
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:06,840
why do they call this a firewall just

498
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,460
accessing the account right and if it's

499
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,140
an app on Alex's phone he would already

500
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:12,570
be logged in my point is this firewall I

501
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:15,090
like you just the way you are but I had

502
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:17,160
a plan yeah and what was that plan

503
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,930
exactly jailbreak wanted to get to the

504
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:21,240
cloud and now that she's here is she

505
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,280
gonna do are there even any other emojis

506
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:26,400
here mass all I feel I know jeans

507
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,410
feeling mad and all but he was also

508
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:29,970
looking directly at the spot that just

509
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:31,530
surprised and captured it and even if

510
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:32,880
the super BOTS got through the firewall

511
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,530
via the email app which is some nonsense

512
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:36,600
even for this movie how did it end up in

513
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,150
the same spot as Dropbox movie does know

514
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,710
that there are different clouds right no

515
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:42,870
god damn it's thing is terrible no

516
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:44,700
problem I could take you right now said

517
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,590
no phone technician ever movie sets up

518
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:47,940
this whole adventure by saying there's

519
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,440
only one way to get to the cloud

520
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,060
but now you can get back on the phone

521
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:54,270
through Dropbox via Twitter

522
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:56,010
Dylan waits to kill protagonists for no

523
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:57,270
other reason than providing him with an

524
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:59,190
escape opportunity cliche jailbreak is

525
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:00,330
able to gain control of this spot

526
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:02,490
because of hack hack thingy-thingy tech

527
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:03,960
tech hack tech the thing the app

528
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,650
happened to be in

529
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:05,910
middle of the phone screen and that

530
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:07,440
resetting a phone to factory settings

531
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,060
works progressively by the physical

532
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,320
location of the apps on the interface

533
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,150
and that I gave up the will to live 30

534
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:15,180
minutes ago Jean you got this even

535
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,530
though Jean spent his entire life with

536
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:17,580
the ability to express different

537
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,470
emotions because he got turned down by

538
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:20,790
some girl a few minutes ago he's

539
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:23,640
completely lost his Emoto I'm in last

540
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,440
time I was in this cube I screwed

541
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,360
everything up gene and therefore movie

542
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,280
has time for this dammit movie you

543
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,870
forced me to see all this nonsense once

544
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:32,640
already puking it at me again is worth

545
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,000
at least 10 cents jailbreak now or 45

546
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,110
seconds ago when this would have been

547
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:39,660
effective hey excuse me Jesus Christ

548
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,460
this is a movie about ping emoji but

549
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,050
doesn't even know how to phone right I

550
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:44,880
mean say Alex unplugged the phone and

551
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,710
somehow stopped the delete and pretend

552
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:48,210
that's an actual thing that works but

553
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:49,560
still deleted when you delete an app

554
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,360
it's been gone so this restoration of

555
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,800
all the apps and everything within them

556
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,110
is the Bulbul in a big movie pile a bowl

557
00:17:55,110 --> 00:18:00,060
add 100 more cents and after this moment

558
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,740
the emoji formerly known as gene went on

559
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,150
to rule tex topples and one of the

560
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,590
longest and most brutal regimes in

561
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:10,410
smartphone history and the andy garcia

562
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:12,270
and passengers award for shortest cameo

563
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:16,440
goes to sofia vergara your request to

564
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,970
launch a pop culture based dance craze

565
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:24,060
has been denied you know for a movie

566
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,590
that set itself up with the whole kids

567
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:26,850
are always on their phones narrative

568
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:28,410
there's been very little phone usage

569
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:29,490
which i guess is a good thing

570
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:30,900
considering this is only like the third

571
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,430
time the emojis have actually gathered

572
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:37,860
in your cubes

573
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:41,470

00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:47,440
forgotten the emoji movie usually I'll

587
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,730
make a reference to the movies food

588
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,950
scenes to start out a nature boxset but

589
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:52,900
in this movie's case just can't remember

590
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:53,500
any of them

591
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:58,289
there was pizza I think all right

592
00:19:58,289 --> 00:20:01,570
whatever emoji movie sucks the fuck more

593
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:02,980
than anything that I've ever fucked

594
