00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,650
hello everyone and welcome back to

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:04,350
another episode of bad unboxing hey

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:05,730
everybody this is sort of an

4
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,910
announcement video cuz I've been absent

5
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:10,980
on the channel as of late I've decided

6
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,840
to bring back one of the old favorites

7
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,389
on the old classics that unboxing fan

8
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:17,220
mail but this time we're gonna do things

9
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,260
a little bit different this time we're

10
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,439
gonna go with the ups there is one rule

11
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:25,890
one very important rule regret Rick

12
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,410
you've discovered you have the power to

13
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,050
transform your PC into the ultimate

14
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,540
machine for your specific needs

15
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,480
and that rule is you have to put idubbbz

16
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,790
TV as the address see but even though

17
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,620
you have to address it to idubbbz TV

18
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,270
that doesn't mean you can't get kind of

19
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,550
creative with it maybe you put idubbbz

20
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:48,270
TV - something else perhaps who knows

21
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,399
but i think as long as idubbbz TV is on

22
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,510
there we should be in good shape no

23
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:57,570
packages are off-limits I'm feeling

24
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,550
fresh and revive lines after a long

25
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:02,640
break so there's a lot we can do with a

26
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,040
brand new season of bad unboxing fan

27
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,920
mail it's gonna be a fun new season this

28
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,560
unboxing let's say it's it's it's gonna

29
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,540
be breaking new ground let's just say

30
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,430
that the old media is really gonna be

31
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,229
scrambling to figure out what to do next

32
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:18,630

33

00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,390
channel is gonna be doing it'll be

42
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:44,100

43
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,420
bit coy with you guys before there's

44
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,070

numero uno no sending me gross stuff

47
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,840
this is a g-rated channel I don't want

48
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,570
