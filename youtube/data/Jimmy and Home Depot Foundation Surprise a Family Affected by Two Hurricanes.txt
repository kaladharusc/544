1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,468
-This next one is from
@SheilaDaniels.

2
00:00:02,468 --> 00:00:03,970
&quot;Jimmy, I saw that
for your birthday this year

3
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:05,438
instead of giving you a gift,

4
00:00:05,438 --> 00:00:08,308
you asked people to do a random
act of kindness for someone.

5
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:09,476
I love that.

6
00:00:09,476 --> 00:00:11,243
Do you think you could do
a random act of kindness

7
00:00:11,243 --> 00:00:12,945
for someone on your show
right now?

8
00:00:12,945 --> 00:00:17,784
[ Cheers and applause ]

9
00:00:17,784 --> 00:00:19,452
Well, that's true.

10
00:00:19,452 --> 00:00:22,922
I did ask people to do a random
act of kindness for my birthday,

11
00:00:22,922 --> 00:00:26,125
and I think that I can
return the favor tonight.

12
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:29,228
In fact, there's a couple
in the audience right now

13
00:00:29,228 --> 00:00:30,463
that I have in mind.

14
00:00:30,463 --> 00:00:32,932
They think they just got tickets
to see the show

15
00:00:32,932 --> 00:00:34,700
and they have no clue
what I'm about to do.

16
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,336
Where are
Divya and Terry McArthur?

17
00:00:37,336 --> 00:00:39,205
[ Cheers and applause ]
Where are you guys?

18
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:41,574
Yeah. Yeah.

19
00:00:41,574 --> 00:00:45,211
How you doing, guys?
I see you. Hey.

20
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:46,479
Hi, guys.

21
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:47,947
[ Laughs ]

22
00:00:47,947 --> 00:00:49,248
How you doing?
-Great.

23
00:00:49,248 --> 00:00:51,583
-Can you stand up?
Say hi. Sure. Hey, how are you?

24
00:00:51,583 --> 00:00:55,320
Divya.
[ Cheers and applause ]

25
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,256
Great to see you, pal.

26
00:00:57,256 --> 00:00:59,258
Thank you for being here.

27

Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

28
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:02,862
You said my name right.
-What's that?

29
00:01:02,862 --> 00:01:04,597
-You said my name right.
-I did? Okay, good.

30
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:06,099
I'm so happy. Thank you.

31
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:09,702
Now, you -- I know a little bit
about you guys.

32
00:01:09,702 --> 00:01:11,837
You had no idea I'm gonna do
anything, right?

33
00:01:11,837 --> 00:01:14,073
-No.
-No. [ Chuckles ]

34
00:01:14,073 --> 00:01:16,475
-You are from North Carolina,
correct?

35
00:01:16,475 --> 00:01:18,911
-Correct.
-And where do you live?

36
00:01:18,911 --> 00:01:21,280
-Lumberton, North Carolina.
-Lumberton, North Carolina.

37
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,117
Yeah, and with your son,
Christian.

38
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:25,251
12?
-Yes.

39
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,086
-Yes.
-And your house,

40
00:01:27,086 --> 00:01:28,487
very special house.

41
00:01:28,487 --> 00:01:30,190
Why is it special to you?

42
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:33,959
-'Cause my grandmother
left it to me.

43
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:35,295
-Your grandmother
left it to you,

44
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:36,862
and you had a tough
couple of years, huh?

45
00:01:36,862 --> 00:01:38,964
-Yes.
-You guys were hit --

46
00:01:38,964 --> 00:01:40,900
was it Hurricane Matthew, 2016?

47
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,836
Hurricane Florence?
-Yes.

48
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:45,104
-And you had no flood insurance.

49
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:46,338
-No.
-No.

50
00:01:46,338 --> 00:01:48,975
