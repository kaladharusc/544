171
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,220
Oh, my god.

Ehehehehe

174
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:47,020
I'm sorry I laughed.

175
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:50,040
AplFisher (reading chat): &quot;'-how little you care about your audience I think you'll get a kick from this:''

176
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,020
'I got hit by a car on the way to work today.'&quot;

177
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:52,960
(Not reading) &quot;WHAT???!?&quot;

178
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,960
(Reading) &quot;'My 500 euro bike is beyond repair...'

'...my neck is stiff and I can barely raise my arm, but my boss made me go to the doctors...'

182
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,500
'That's a win in my book'&quot;

183
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,500
&quot;DUDE, YOU GOT HIT BY A CAR THAT'S NOT A WIN, DUDE.&quot;

184
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,500
Reading another message: &quot;Crazy story, I was on my way to work today, and some dumbass...&quot;

185
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,420
&quot;...cyclist pulled out in front of me.&quot;

186
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:13,500
&quot;Naturally I ran him over. These fuckers think they own the road or something.&quot;

187
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,500
Another story: &quot;So my mom was driving me home from school today...&quot;

&quot;...for insurance money.&quot; &quot;Hey Aidan...

191
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,500
&quot;'...I am so sorry that that happened to you.'&quot;

192
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,500
&quot;Wow, so many accidents with bikes today, all around the same time.&quot;

193
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,500
&quot;'Funny story, just...'

*Music repeats as Mark continues laughing hysterically*

230
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:19,860
Mark: The only reason why that one makes me laugh at all, it's because it was just unexpected. (Sure Mark.)

231
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,220
Girl: Not to be racist or anything...
