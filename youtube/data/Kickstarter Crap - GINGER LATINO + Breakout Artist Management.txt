77
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,450
this is one of those template projects I

78
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:04,680
don't want to see this template crap

79
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,420
okay here's another one let's check this

80

81
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:11,100
is the same as the other one okay I

82
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,959
think I finally found a unique project

83
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,300
okay this one isn't the breakout artist

84
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,130
management cancer that we just looked at

85
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,920

lakenya kickstart off fucking around

87
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,750
breakout artist management is offered to

88
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,490
work with and develop this project to

89
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:33,290
help take it to the next level you're

90
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:35,000
probably wondering who the fuck is

91
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,400
breakout artist management well it's a

92
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,350
cancer company that makes cancer

93
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:41,209
Kickstarter projects that are all exact

94
00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:43,520
clones of one another yes exact clones

95
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,040
everything is a clone of another one

96
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,450
there are a few things that change

97
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:49,850
between projects like the name of the

98
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:51,709
artist mentioned in the video and the

99
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:53,810
funding goal but everything else is a

100
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,910
fucking template there are war tears all

101
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,680
templates are all the same shit you look

102
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,200
at the reward tiers let's go to the $750

103
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,810
tier a one hour acoustic show in your

104
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,060
home this option is great for birthday

105
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:07,280
parties or any occasion at all I think

106
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,980
it'd be very valuable to spend $750 to

107
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:12,860
have lakenya come to your birthday party

108
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,810

109
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:17,419
guaranteed awkward out for both lakenya

110
00:04:17,419 --> 00:04:19,489

fever brah what are the cool things

120
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,840
about breakout artist management is

121
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,220
they'll trick you into thinking that

122
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,110
their projects are successful by funding

123
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,640
it themselves if you look at their

124
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,169
project you'll notice that there's a

125
00:04:45,169 --> 00:04:46,789
weird trend with a lot of them there's

126
00:04:46,789 --> 00:04:48,830
quite a few that are successfully funded

127
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,680
just over the funding amount three

128
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,160
thousand $55 with 19 backers wow that's

129
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,310
a large amount of money per backer three

130
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:01,430
thousand $1 with 19 backers four

131
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:04,700
thousand $1 with 15 backers successfully

132
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:09,200
raised $2,500 with one backer Wow

133
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,350
whoever made this project must have been

134
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:15,830
well prepared professional and have some

135
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:18,110
dashingly good looks to be able to pull

136
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,180
an investor willing to drop twenty five

137
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:23,350
hundred dollars on their shitty album oh

138
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:26,600
it's it's the big town boys I love these

139
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,060
guys this is an actual photo that they

140
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,070
wanted to put out for their band

141
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,380
I think it's physically impossible for

142
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,030
these boys to take a worse picture than

143
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:35,419
that

144
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:37,460
it's like they all just woke up after a

145
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,229
sleepover and one guy said hey

146
00:05:39,229 --> 00:05:41,240
we have our guitars can you take a

147
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,860
picture of us in front of the swamp

148
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:45,409
while I'm wearing my lazy t-shirt and my

149
00:05:45,409 --> 00:05:46,849
other friends are wearing their wrinkled

150
00:05:46,849 --> 00:05:47,449
t-shirts

151
00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:49,189
I took a visit to the breakout artist

152
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:51,050
management website and lo and behold

153
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,419
under their development clients all the

154
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:56,419
clients who miraculously got funded are

155
00:05:56,419 --> 00:05:57,620
listed there

156
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,689
I don't like breakout artist management

157
00:05:59,689 --> 00:06:02,180
but they might not be that bad compared

158
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,340
to what the project creators would make

159
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,650
if they didn't have the help of breakout

160
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:08,539
or risk management here's a beatboxer

161
00:06:08,539 --> 00:06:13,759
who wants $85,000 push into that you're

162
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:20,689
bad Native American English / Chickasaw

163
00:06:20,689 --> 00:06:23,180
hippie rock star album that way you're

164
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:32,419
gonna call the album here's a woman

165
00:06:32,419 --> 00:06:33,949
who's not even singing she's just
