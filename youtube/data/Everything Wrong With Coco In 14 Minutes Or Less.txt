1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:10,410
when all Disney and Pixar studios just

2
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:11,940
merge already they are only separate

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,590
because they both love Legos also I

4
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:14,670
don't care if it's two of the most

5
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:16,680
successful studios of all time that's 44

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,320
seconds of two logos sometimes I think

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,800
I'm cursed and a narration in one day he

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,260
left with his guitar and never returned

9
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,539
the opening narek position of this movie

10
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:28,800
is so Beauty and the Beast that I now

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,330
have expecting at least one character to

12
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,719
end up with Stockholm Syndrome and she

13
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:35,670
learned to make shoes the role of the

14
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:36,930
great-great-grandmother will be played

15
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:37,800
by Daniel day-lewis

16
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,149
who not only learned to actually make

17
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:40,739
shoes in preparation for this role he

18
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:42,690
spent the last year being animated God

19
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,219
he's such a craftsman you know the last

20
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:45,690
time I was in a room with a woman this

21
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:54,480
old wrestling mask and feathers I'm not

22
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,370
sure hatred of music could or would be

23
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,379
passed down this many generations no one

24
00:00:58,379 --> 00:00:59,760
in this family ever stop to ask if maybe

25
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,500
the real villain in that story they tell

26
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,120
every year is the music man and not

27
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,949
music itself the inside jokes and these

28
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:06,689
Pixar movies and movies in general are

29
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:11,820
becoming distracted no this really is

30
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,380
just the Mexican animated version of

31
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:18,180
Footloose right tewi brave mallanna

32
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,549
the good dinosaur frozen plains Zootopia

33
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:22,470
would it be weird to see a Disney Pixar

34
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:23,939
movie about a protagonist that was

35
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:25,590
exactly like their family and following

36
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,000
all the rules and was still a compelling

37
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,470
character the inside jokes and these

38
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,060
Pixar movies and movies in general are

39
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,940
becoming distracting

40
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:36,380
while I ponder this oddly casual death

41
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,120
being played for a LAN if I have to ask

42
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,980
was there any reason that Bell had to be

43
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,930
real I know this is a cartoon but the

44
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:43,490
candles and flowers situation here is

45
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:44,960
making me anxious not to mention all

46
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,550
that fruit next to the candles who wants

47
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:48,170
warm raw fruit and ordinarily I would

48
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:51,350
approve of the booze but again fire is

49
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,790
the one night of the year

50
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:55,580
our ancestors can come visit us we put

51
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:57,910
their folders on the ofrenda so there's

52
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:00,530
crossover expositional lecturing I feel

53
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:02,030
like I've seen this idiot dog character

54
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:03,680
played this same way in at least three

55
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,750
previous Disney movies that he or anyone

56
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,970
including Jesus and Bob Dylan could ever

57
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:12,620
properly tune a busting ass home a

58
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,150
beater guitar like that look at this

59
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,500
thing the strings are all different

60
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,300
distance apart from each other this kids

61
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,160
arnesto shrine it's kind of sweet and it

62
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,870
shows he really does get what the Day of

63
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,370
the Dead is all about just with his

64
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:24,290
personal hero as opposed to family but I

65
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:26,150
still can't remove a sin the fire safety

66
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,890
ignorance is a much bigger generational

67
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:28,940
problem for this family than their

68
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,650
hatred of music earlier his grandma had

69
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,940
super-hearing for anything resembling

70
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,770
music but here he is in the Attic

71
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:35,150
listening to and playing along with

72
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,980
music and no one in the entire house he

73
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:43,250
was it I will also take a sin off

74
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,810
because of how well this movie portrays

75
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:47,180
Miguel's genuine deep love of every note

76
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,160
a treat I've only ever seen in the very

77
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,350
best and purest musicians sure he can

78
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:53,239
sneak out but his family celebrates this

79
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:54,560
event together and they're going to

80
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,030
notice him missing I don't know how he

81
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,500
expects this plan to work the deal is

82
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,750
kind of stupid it's time he joined us

83
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:05,090
see the workshop watcher this is

84
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:06,739
exciting information but why does Miguel

85
00:03:06,739 --> 00:03:08,300
think that this changes anything he

86
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,920
already knew that Mama Coco's father was

87
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,720
a musician right so why is he emboldened

88
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,909
to spill all this to his family

89
00:03:15,909 --> 00:03:21,469
Kirt wrestling well I yelled his name a

90
00:03:21,469 --> 00:03:22,969
couple times that's probably enough to

91
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:24,409
convince him to come back no need to

92
00:03:24,409 --> 00:03:26,030
chase after him or anything how was the

93
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,409
guitar not crushed along with her nest

94
00:03:27,409 --> 00:03:29,450
oh by that Tim Burton's Batman Bell that

95
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:32,120
kid is 65 pounds tops the only way that

96
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,739
lid moves here is if it's greased

97
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:37,489
granted we're about to experience

98
00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:39,980
spirits and magic and supernatural that

99
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,659
guitar being in tune is going to end up

100
00:03:41,659 --> 00:03:42,950
being the number one thing that bugs me

101
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:44,810
about this movie also koko and the six

102
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:47,900
strings what were there people who heard

103
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,340
a strum drawn rapidly here with

104
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:54,230
flashlights how that would Julio know

105
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:56,239
this sure they are able to get back and

106
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:57,859
forth today but they have no clue what's

107
00:03:57,859 --> 00:03:59,120
happened to Miguel and this could

108
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,310
potentially kill him dead I see heaven

109
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,739
was designed by dr. Seuss hey so Christo

110
00:04:03,739 --> 00:04:05,060
I wanted to take us in off for the

111
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,889
unbelievable animation about five times

112
00:04:06,889 --> 00:04:08,480
already and the movies finally broken me

113
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,680
two cents off you mean to tell me I've

114
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,780
got to put up with in customs even after

115
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:17,150
I'm dead if the border agents know that

116
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:18,410
the bridge won't allow anyone to cross

117
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:20,150
over why do they even bother trying to

118
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:30,020
stop Hector bridge analytic old timey

119
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,430
bookkeeping skeleton guy would be

120
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:33,560
excellent at summer sense your family's

121
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,080
blessing and everything should go back

122
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,860
to normal

123
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,050
well you've got a do it by Sunrise who's

124
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:41,060
making up the rules on all this you had

125
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,159
his fingers back to the futuring should

126
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:44,810
we tell him there are no restrooms in

127
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:45,979
the land of the dead there are no

128
00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:52,159
restrooms but there are pet allergies so

129
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:54,139
I'm letting you off with a warning

130
00:04:54,139 --> 00:04:55,789
- is there law and order in the land of

131
00:04:55,789 --> 00:04:57,349
the Dead all the time or just during the

132
00:04:57,349 --> 00:04:59,090
Day of the Dead and regardless what's

133
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,099
the judiciary system based on do they

134
00:05:01,099 --> 00:05:02,930
use the same laws as the living if so

135
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:04,460
what replaces the death penalty for a

136
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,630
particularly egregious acts

137
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:09,080
oh nice gag solid joke

138
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,120
why does he even have eyeballs sure her

139
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,889
spirit guide is a horn Panther dragon

140
00:05:12,889 --> 00:05:15,110
okay but they said earlier the spirit

141
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:16,490
guides help the spirits find their way

142
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:18,500
not help find their missing living

143
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,909
descendants who were escaping in dead

144
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:20,240
land

145
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,770
why does a spirit guide even have any

146
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:23,630
human finding talents anyway who has

147
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:24,040
that

148
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,790
don't touch but why the Mizpah betta

149
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:29,740
taking flight Miguel just ran down the

150
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,030
road a few seconds ago and Pepita

151
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,380
apparently has his scent already

152
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,850
seriously they should have given this

153
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:41,530
dog a story credit this land of the dead

154
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:42,910
still celebrates the rich and famous

155
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:44,680
from life like Ernesto and his tower

156
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,660
party going on right now but this place

157
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:48,250
also bullies and mocks people who choke

158
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,750
to death in life and all I can think

159
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,640
about now here is where exactly Jimi

160
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,810
Hendrix would land on the social scale

161
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,640
here also they're mocking this guy for

162
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,320
choking to death but Ernesto gets a

163
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,730
celebrity pass against afterlife

164
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:59,140
bullying even though he died by falling

165
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,540
Mexican Liberty Bell you really want to

166
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,730
get to a Nesta there is that music

167
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,410
competition at the Plaza de la Cruz

168
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:08,170
winner gets to play at his par

169
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:09,850
not only is everything in this room

170
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:11,590
expositional fodder for Miguel's journey

171
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:13,330
there's an extremely convenient music

172
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:15,010
festival that would allow him to meet de

173
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:16,990
la Cruz also this is the second major

174
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:18,580
music competition in this movie and

175
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,930
while it's not the movies fault

176
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:21,460
the pitch-perfect series has really worn

177
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,720
me out on that kind of thing as a plot

178
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:32,470
device okay first of all you lending

179
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:34,060
your femur is on you I don't care if

180
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,230
this guy is the Homer Simpson of

181
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,880
borrowing neighbors never lend out bones

182
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,140
crucial emotive function

183
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,760
second of all how in the name of voodoo

184
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,710
witchcraft did you use any kind of twine

185
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:43,900
string tying device to secure this pipe

186
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,810
to this bone in this manner

187
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:48,010
look movie you can't have Miguel take

188
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:49,210
down a tomb guitar that hadn't been

189
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:50,860
touched over a hundred years and play it

190
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,570
with it being perfectly in tune and then

191
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:54,310
later feel me someone casually tuning a

192
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:56,080
guitar before playing it either guitar

193
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,670
tuning manners in this movie or it does

194
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:59,890
not pick one another sin off for the

195
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:01,750
movie again getting gifted guitarists

196
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,340
right every single one I've ever met can

197
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,690
wow me with their own playing in one

198
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,550
moment but sit in awe at the talent of

199
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:17,530
another player in the next classy Pixar

200
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:18,970
this is one of those jokes for the

201
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:20,530
parents studios like to sneak into kids

202
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:22,180
movies but in this case the kids will

203
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,410
actually get the joke which is

204
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,470
concerning

205
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:27,910
chicharrón waits to Yoda until the exact

206
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,560
moment Hector and Miguel show up just so

207
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:34,020
Hector can explain how that works

208
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,950
shouldn't the tequila be running through

209
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,210
Hector's skeleton and hitting the floor

210
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:39,220
I never thought I'd say this but Barbosa

211
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,810
from Pirates of the Caribbean is a more

212
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:43,180
believable dead guy wait what happened

213
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:45,700
he's being forgotten ooh okay so he's

214
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,080
living in a hammock and this part of the

215
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,490
dead land for those who never get their

216
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:49,690
picture put up during day of the dead

217
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:50,320
fine

218
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,610
but now that he's been entirely

219
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:53,920
forgotten he disintegrates so many

220
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,720
questions but chief among them who the

221
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,070
fuck was thinking about this guy in the

222
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,630
last couple decades but not putting his

223
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,910
picture up cuz that guy is a douche when

224
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:02,350
there's no one left in the living world

225
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,430
who remembers you

226
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,980
you disappear from this world we call it

227
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:09,220
the sign of death cool and then what

228
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,780
happens after final death final death

229
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,340
land how many layers are there Oh

230
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:15,400
memories they have to be passed down by

231
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,220
those who knew us in life hmm well I

232
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,230
find that to be simple my memories

233
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:21,520
aren't good enough or powerful enough

234
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,840
unless I've talked about them ad nauseam

235
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,060
around enough friends that one of them

236
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,250
still remembers the stories also this

237
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,990
movie that is clearly pro-family fine

238
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:31,390
that is cool is so pro-family they risk

239
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,770
alienating people who don't have a lot

240
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:34,120
of siblings or those that choose not to

241
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,370
have children a minority yes I'm just

242
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:38,050
saying movie is not right suggesting I

243
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:39,340
should have kids and tell them all my

244
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,470
stories and if I'm honest kids give me

245
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:42,940
panic attacks but I still have good

246
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,650
stories let's talk about how the land of

247
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:46,060
the dead but not final Dead has

248
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,460
electricity if you all don't play one

249
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,290
song how can I call myself a musician

250
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:57,160
never stop Britney Spears dude awesome i

251
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,600
legit applaud this movie for having

252
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,400
Miguel kicking ass in his first

253
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,200
performance I get it and I love it but

254
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,940
when he spin dances six feet left of the

255
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,740
mic his voice continues being projected

256
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:06,760
as though he were still in front of the

257
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,650
mic and I'm sorry I can't let that slide

258
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:10,420
you bothered to put a microphone in dead

259
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:13,810
land and carry that through movie boy

260
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:15,550
have you looked at the stage of the

261
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:17,560
arena you're in Jesus lady he's wearing

262
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,850
the same outfit is when he left you guys

263
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,800
huh apparently pretending to be dead

264
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,690
gives you a zoom and enhanced superpower

265
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:27,550
even Pixar is an immune to shoot warning

266
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,290
in a protagonist argue and separate

267
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:30,640
before the climax of the movie cliche

268
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,339
gah cuz every movie had to do this

269
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:35,509
flying magical beasts combination

270
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:36,529
somehow can't get through a narrow

271
00:09:36,529 --> 00:09:38,809
staircase in the land of the dead now

272
00:09:38,809 --> 00:09:40,220
honestly clueless on the rules of this

273
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,600
movie and that's a problem worth

274
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,739
mentioning even though the average

275
00:09:42,739 --> 00:09:44,929
viewer glosses over it family's supposed

276
00:09:44,929 --> 00:09:48,259
to do support you but you never will

277
00:09:48,259 --> 00:09:50,329
sick bear and kid well I like a sound

278
00:09:50,329 --> 00:09:51,679
let you run off to your concert even

279
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:53,029
though I have a magic spirit animal that

280
00:09:53,029 --> 00:09:54,199
could easily intercept you on the other

281
00:09:54,199 --> 00:09:55,850
side of this alley wait they're using a

282
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:58,220
super powerful spirit animal to surfing

283
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,769
hors d'oeuvres deadmau5 nobody notices

284
00:10:00,769 --> 00:10:06,459
this this works

285
00:10:06,459 --> 00:10:10,189
forget the rest back from security do

286
00:10:10,189 --> 00:10:11,989
they honestly have time for polo isn't

287
00:10:11,989 --> 00:10:13,040
Miguel on a mission that is

288
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,629
time-sensitive and confined to a single

289
00:10:14,629 --> 00:10:16,910
day I am sorry to see you go me again

290
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,109
it's at this point that movie

291
00:10:18,109 --> 00:10:19,339
prematurely gives the twist away

292
00:10:19,339 --> 00:10:20,839
considering there's 30 minutes of

293
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:22,489
runtime left and there's no way this

294
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:24,410
will actually work that's me that goes

295
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:29,989
toast and does in a gross movie look in

296
00:10:29,989 --> 00:10:32,660
the movie Donnie Darko poisons the drink

297
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,579
hang on this exact clip is playing right

298
00:10:34,579 --> 00:10:36,019
now I'm really starting to think they

299
00:10:36,019 --> 00:10:37,489
should change the name to land at the

300
00:10:37,489 --> 00:10:39,649
plot coincidence I would move heaven and

301
00:10:39,649 --> 00:10:41,839
earth for you me I'm eagle I guess

302
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,100
ernesto has just been carrying that

303
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,749
poison around in a suitcase this entire

304
00:10:44,749 --> 00:10:46,610
tour waiting for a chance to use it if

305
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:48,379
you murder a living human kid in the

306
00:10:48,379 --> 00:10:50,329
land of the dead does he die or what he

307
00:10:50,329 --> 00:10:51,739
never died the first time so we can't

308
00:10:51,739 --> 00:10:53,839
die a final death here which means that

309
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,459
best-case scenario he just comes back

310
00:10:55,459 --> 00:10:57,649
here as a proper skeleton no my daughter

311
00:10:57,649 --> 00:11:01,519
she's the reason you wanted to cross the

312
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,489
bridge I just wanted to see her again

313
00:11:04,489 --> 00:11:06,049
but I neglected to mention the sole

314
00:11:06,049 --> 00:11:07,069
reason that I've been trying to make

315
00:11:07,069 --> 00:11:08,299
this happen during this entire movie

316
00:11:08,299 --> 00:11:10,489
until now I mean seriously this movie

317
00:11:10,489 --> 00:11:12,079
would have been over a long time ago if

318
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,309
Hector had said anything about his

319
00:11:13,309 --> 00:11:14,839
daughter I wish I could tell her that

320
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:17,269
her bout was trying to come home Hector

321
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:18,980
plays the pronoun game with Coco just so

322
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,389
we can wring a little more tension out

323
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:23,689
of this reveal my role Coco's even after

324
00:11:23,689 --> 00:11:25,039
the realization that they're related and

325
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:26,660
can easily rectify both of their

326
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,069
situations by finding one of those

327
00:11:28,069 --> 00:11:29,600
plentiful petals and getting Hector's

328
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,009
blessing these assholes sit around this

329
00:11:31,009 --> 00:11:35,619
cave instead of searching for a way out

330
00:11:35,619 --> 00:11:37,939
why was he so stupid and normal looking

331
00:11:37,939 --> 00:11:40,009
and stupid then god I hate this dog does

332
00:11:40,009 --> 00:11:41,149
everything here and have to be

333
00:11:41,149 --> 00:11:41,869
skull-shaped

334
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:43,150
he left this

335
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:45,430
try to go home to you in golf ball but

336
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:48,490
delacruz murdered him it's true goddamn

337
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:49,540
it then why didn't you find a way to

338
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,100
tell this to a medal - the whole time

339
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,330
that you were in the land of the dead

340
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:54,190
this entire movie could have been solved

341
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,810
with simple communication you will

342
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:58,270
return home no more music

343
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:04,140
family comes first what oh did you oh

344
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,190
not only is this a terrible way to

345
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:07,720
convince her nesto to hand over the

346
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,370
photograph technically miguel is a

347
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,110
melda's great-great-grandson so

348
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:12,370
everything about this scene is kind of

349
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:13,990
wrong like basically all Pixar movies

350
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:15,460
this film devolves into a garden-variety

351
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,630
chase scene at the end

352
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,430
fortunately for Imelda in the movie

353
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:19,990
security takes a Blues Brothers the

354
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,760
intact of advancing on a performer on

355
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,900
stage you're going home you're not going

356
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,420
anywhere and that's on Miguel for taking

357
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:34,210
his sweet-ass time to grab that pedal to

358
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:36,160
keep your memory alive

359
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,839
billon expose it to zeebo plan for all

360
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:41,710
the world to see cliche look we all knew

361
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:43,360
there would be another spirit animal X

362
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,520
Mok in a moment here but the poppy to

363
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,020
this long somehow even though the

364
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,970
cameras are inside the stadium there's a

365
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:50,470
perfectly frame shot of the killing bell

366
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,420
for everyone to see

367
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:55,180
damn it dad's classic move of ordering

368
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,680
the kid to stop but not pursuing him is

369
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,600
still not working don't know what keeps

370
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,750
going wrong please if we forget him

371
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,570
he'll be gone forever

372
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:07,000
ah eternal sunshine I knew this movie

373
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,440
was basically an amalgamation of five

374
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,120
other movies and until now I only knew

375
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,140
four of them Back to the Future

376
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,130
crossroads

377
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:13,540
heaven can wait The Passion of the

378
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:16,000
Christ obviously and finally Eternal

379
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,920
Sunshine of the spotless mind yeah glad

380
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,750
that's solved I should remove a sin for

381
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,279
the scene being so emotionally powerful

382
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:25,990
but since I can't see what I'm writing

383
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:27,610
while ugly crying I'll just let this

384
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:28,900
encounter do what it wants

385
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,150

387
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,210
song we've heard roughly 54 times

388
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:40,720
already in the movie just keeps going on

389
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,970
