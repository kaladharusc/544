1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,850
I am definitely going to get in trouble

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:28,360
for going up here

3
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:32,419
bright and early 7:00 a.m. today special

4
00:00:32,419 --> 00:00:38,440
running guests this morning Nev Schulman

5
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:42,830
have you been running Nev nah that's

6
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:45,260
just like a bike now today really begins

7
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:50,199
my marathon my Boston training for that

8
00:00:50,199 --> 00:00:53,150
most people don't like when they get a

9
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:54,170
run in their stockings

10
00:00:54,170 --> 00:01:12,220
I love front-of-house that run for you

11
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:16,090
I just got splashed my wife a big way

12
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:17,290
I'm soaked

13
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:21,450
I was posed at 20 honey some miles 20

14
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,100
nose 8 that was a lead eight miles

15
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:32,020
all right need 30 pull-ups 30 dips

16
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:36,290
that's a wrap feel strong good to see

17
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:52,110
you sir all right my friend safe travels

18
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:55,330
Candace and Francine and her mom all

19
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:57,159
came down like a blue last night I

20
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:03,380
better not get sick

21
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:11,680
how was breakfast Francine

22
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:17,209
you want to go I was invited to go see

23
00:02:17,209 --> 00:02:20,420
Star Wars in IMAX with a friend but I

24
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,870
totally stuffed the time and now worried

25
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:34,519
I'm not going to make it the streets are

26
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:35,180
a little wet

27
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,950
I hate riding when the streets are a

28
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,870
little wet and this motorcycle is

29
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:52,590
steaming up a storm

30
00:02:52,590 --> 00:03:06,830
I never know where I'm going

31
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:12,040
whenever you keep slow

32
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,230
ah

33
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:27,120
I have no idea where I'm going

34
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,330
Wow it was great it was really all right

35
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:46,590
let's get started

36
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:49,030
for today's Q&amp;A I wanted to do something

37
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,620
a little different so I asked people on

38
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:53,110
Twitter to answer questions from me and

39
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,820
I thought I would share the questions I

40
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,340
mean the answers to my questions that I

41
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,590
found most interesting what is it that

42
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:02,740
you like about vloggers like not just me

43
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,420
in particular but like all vloggers why

44
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,190
watch a vlogger instead of watching I

45
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,810
don't know TV show or something else

46
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:10,240
like that I can just see people's lives

47
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:15,750
in their eyes as structured as TV shows

48
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,830
that is interesting because in

49
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,299
television there are producers there are

50
00:04:19,299 --> 00:04:21,340
people between like the character and

51
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:23,080
then the finished product and I guess in

52
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,240
vlogging it's more true it's fascinating

53
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,340
to see other individuals perspectives on

54
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:30,310
certain life situations vloggers based

55
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,200
on true stories told by the Creator the

56
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,600
common thread with all the answers that

57
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,520
I'm finding is that viewers have a real

58
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,230
appreciation for seeing other people's

59
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:40,090
perspective which is kind of the exact

60
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:42,460
reason I would give for why vlog I love

61
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,160
sharing my perspective question number

62
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,500
two is what makes a vlog interesting

63
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,140
okay see how much vlogs because it's a

64
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,960
new way to watch stories and at least to

65
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,670
watch TV all the time they would tell

66
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,770
stories and they're written but these

67
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:59,500
are like real life stories what makes it

68
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,410
look interesting is that is real is

69
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:04,810
really everything is what I see what you

70
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:05,870
saw from your

71
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,760
it's pretty much your point of view

72
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,740
we're so inundated today with like

73
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,840
content there's so much crammed in our

74
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,060
faces all the time and most of it's just

75
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,500
garbage that's trying to sell us

76
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,960
something and what I like about vlogging

77
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,030
and what I like about vloggers is that

78
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:21,200
it feels like there's some truth there

79
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,540
there's some honesty and I can trust

80
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,760
that authenticity in ways that like I

81
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,400
guess I've grown jaded towards what is

82
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:37,940
more traditional media I'm finding this

83
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:41,120
like really valuable research for my own

84
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,430
career okay my last question the last

85
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,650
question that I asked was what do you

86
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:47,810
see as the future of media meaning like

87
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:51,470
TV Internet YouTube even like snapchat

88
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:54,200
where are things headed here's here's

89
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:58,790
the first answer I get pretty soon it's

90
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,950
all going to be like Holograms from Star

91
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:04,820
Wars you know I don't know that I agree

92
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,880
with that look we had 3d IMAX movies

93
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,910
like 10 years ago but now we all watch

94
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,650
movies on our cell phones I don't think

95
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:14,660
it's gonna get bigger or like the

96
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,220
technology is gonna be radically

97
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,780
different I think it's gonna be like

98
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,210
it's just gonna be everywhere like it'll

99
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:22,010
be in my glasses but not like Google

100
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:24,890
glass I believe the future of media is

101
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:28,220
gonna be TV goes away everything is

102
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,520
gonna be online and digital

103
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,460
I agree with you entirely and I'm

104
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,930
betting my future on it

105
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:38,319
Myles life broadcast television will

106
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,169
probably die out ten years I think

107
00:06:41,169 --> 00:06:44,889
sports and news will still kind of keep

108
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:47,259
television afloat in some way but as far

109
00:06:47,259 --> 00:06:48,789
as I tuned in to watch TV shows I think

110
00:06:48,789 --> 00:06:50,440
we're already seeing the death of that I

111
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,910
think Netflix put a nail in that coffin

112
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:54,669
all right I got to stop because I'm like

113
00:06:54,669 --> 00:06:56,259
tweeting this live and now people are

114
00:06:56,259 --> 00:06:58,569
showing up because they figured out

115
00:06:58,569 --> 00:07:05,560
where I am sorry I didn't mean to scare

116
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,009
you

117
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:11,590
and so sorry sorry about that I just

118
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:13,000
talked to Candice she said she was

119
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,560
feeling better so maybe we'll do

120
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,690
something fun tonight we've done

121
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:19,120
anything fun in a while oh I think I

122
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,389
just ran over a light bulb

123
00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:24,840
super fun night with the family we did

124
