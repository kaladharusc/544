1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,370
hi everyone my name is Tamra chambers

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:04,890
and I'm double boiler now why did you

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:07,140
big devil doesn't take any sense but

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,900
mrs. jammers never seen and that's never

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,880
seen and today we're watching the

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,580
original Texas Chainsaw Massacre I

7
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,560
absolutely try watching this when I was

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,570
in high school some would argue the best

9
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:21,539
way on shitty VHS it was it was so

10
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:23,550
shitty though and like it was all orange

11
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,080
and black I could barely make it out

12
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,939
that's just like and I think I got up to

13
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:28,859
the first kill away yeah but everyone

14
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:30,330
says it's a classic you know it's like

15
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,279
this incredible film so I figured okay I

16
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:33,719
should give this a chance I didn't

17
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:34,890
realize there were eight of them I

18
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,239
always thought like maybe there's the

19
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:37,649
first and then I've only seen that

20
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:40,350
Jessica Biel remake of it did you see

21
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,210
that before this one oh yeah okay and I

22
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,100
really liked that movie

23
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,590
I haven't seen any of them so this is

24
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,329
totally brand-new the Jessica Biel

25
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:49,980
remake one was something I watched in

26
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,090
high school and it was one of the first

27
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,129
like horror slasher films I had ever

28
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:56,309
seen and I loved it I'm excited to watch

29
00:00:56,309 --> 00:00:58,829
this and see if it like aged well if it

30
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:01,859
lives up to like the gross Ness of what

31
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:04,379
leather faces or if it's beautifully

32
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,090
dated either it's timeless or

33
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:07,710
beautifully dated I'm always hoping for

34
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,330
one of those - yeah that's a good way to

35
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,720
put that yeah Lisa will a let's find out

36
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:24,330
what towba first yeah I'm happy it was a

37
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:27,479
family picture this was exactly what I

38
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:29,880
thought would be and the exact opposite

39
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,229
of what I thought it would be somehow

40
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:32,610
what do you mean by that

41
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:35,549
okay it's so I knew there's gonna be a

42
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:37,530
guy going around killing people with a

43
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:38,850
chainsaw that kind of goes without

44
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:41,939
saying but then you get to like the last

45
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:45,479
third where like the killer is wearing

46
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:47,790
makeup and stuff and there's more people

47
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,220
it's this weird dinner scene and I have

48
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,280
no idea what or why they were doing any

49
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,350
of that and just the whole style and

50
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,240
everything is so strange I mean I've

51
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,740
been through some tense dinners in my

52
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:03,450
life I've never been the intense dinner

53
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,869
hey we have fun

54
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:08,550
I had like a mild stomach ache

55
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,470
throughout this entire thing there's a

56
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,739
real

57
00:02:11,739 --> 00:02:14,360
uneasiness to the whole thing anyway

58
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,459
we've just seen a lot more films and

59
00:02:16,459 --> 00:02:17,659
stuff like that but yeah there's

60
00:02:17,659 --> 00:02:20,180
something not just sort of the gritty

61
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,280
style and the whole seventy style of it

62
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,250
but just this general unnerving this to

63
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,349
the way that guy comes out and the way

64
00:02:27,349 --> 00:02:29,720
he kills people in a film today I feel

65
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,280
like him just throwing these people

66
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,720
around and throwing like the girl in the

67
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,180
ice box and stuff like that what kind of

68
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,829
be seen as funny but he's just so

69
00:02:36,829 --> 00:02:39,799
massive and so creepy that you just

70
00:02:39,799 --> 00:02:41,030
can't believe how he's throwing these

71
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,950
people around like they're nothing yes I

72
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,989
think my favorite part of the entire

73
00:02:44,989 --> 00:02:46,519
film talking about him coming out is

74
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:49,459
your first reveal of Leatherface is

75
00:02:49,459 --> 00:02:52,129
there's no music cue he opens up and

76
00:02:52,129 --> 00:02:54,560
it's silent and then he grabs the guy

77
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,299
and then shuts the door and it's like no

78
00:02:56,299 --> 00:02:58,370
you would probably get like a very

79
00:02:58,370 --> 00:02:59,720
dramatic music here or at least

80
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,359
something there and it was so silent and

81
00:03:02,359 --> 00:03:05,389
I was just like that's the most

82
00:03:05,389 --> 00:03:09,859
terrifying door closed I was kind of

83
00:03:09,859 --> 00:03:13,970
like what funny note about this movie

84
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,949
and my friend Jason law has told me this

85
00:03:15,949 --> 00:03:17,449
he's a horror fanatic he knows all about

86
00:03:17,449 --> 00:03:20,060
this uh this was originally supposed to

87
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:23,959
be a PG movie now let me explain that

88
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:26,269
because it does make sense riggers the

89
00:03:26,269 --> 00:03:28,730
Lost Ark is PG and there's heads blowing

90
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:29,989
up and people get stabbed through the

91
00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:32,030
you know eyes and heads and on stuff

92
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,199
like that I don't know why I said eyes

93
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:35,720
that doesn't happen anyway so PG

94
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,699
actually meant parental guidance back

95
00:03:37,699 --> 00:03:40,730
then like look this is not for everyone

96
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:42,739
you know you may want this this is a

97
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:44,780
tough movie that are it's like absolute

98
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:47,000
adults like you know don't bring the

99
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,099
kids at all now peaches like frozen and

100
00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:51,500
inside out I like theirs if someone says

101
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,329
the word sex it's like a peachy you you

102
00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:55,159
know something like that we're back then

103
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:57,620
it really meant something it was really

104
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:00,440
warranted so this guy if you think about

105
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,629
it was not really showing much of gore

106
00:04:02,629 --> 00:04:04,340
at all you get a little bit like the

107
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,739
bodies and in the opening but you know

108
00:04:06,739 --> 00:04:08,659
what when he puts the woman on the hook

109
00:04:08,659 --> 00:04:10,519
and everything you don't see a thing

110
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:12,650
yeah it's just all suggesting the acting

111
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:14,930
is so good so apparently people were

112
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:16,609
really discussed and they saw it it's

113
00:04:16,609 --> 00:04:21,139
like well of course it's an arm was so

114
00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:23,870
fake and I wake up I really felt for the

115
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:24,450
character

116
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,400
I think the acting was really well done

117
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,140
I wasn't expecting that I think I think

118
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,730
I was expecting it oh you know it's like

119
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:31,830
a yeah it's like a horror slasher like

120
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,990
it's just gonna be like silly the acting

121
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:37,850
was very convincing what I love is

122
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:40,290
especially in the 90s when you saw like

123
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:42,180
a person in a wheelchair it's like oh

124
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,580
that's the person in the wheelchair if

125
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,740
the wheelchair trope or whatever like we

126
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,600
just got to get in you know and there's

127
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,340
the black kid and there's the girl in

128
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,380
there and like this person is in a

129
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,510
wheelchair but he's not the wheelchair

130
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:57,180
guy like he is really weird and out

131
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,340
there and funny and I just love the shit

132
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,950
out of it but he was also pain too so

133
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,690
funny Holly which is so good cuz he's

134
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:05,190
like well-rounded he's not like this

135
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:07,050
sympathetic character in a wheelchair it

136
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,270
was like he's just a person I think my

137
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,950
favorite character was the hitchhiker

138
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,660
brother that they pick up he was

139
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:16,560
terrified know scary he was like maybe

140
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,260
creepier than Leatherface yeah who is

141
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,690
also very creepy and yes James Franco

142
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:23,960
with a birthmark

143
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,820
I wrote down James Franco I also thought

144
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,970
Walter and again I mean it's just like

145
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:32,340
it's just so early the creepiness kind

146
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,410
of starts where it's just like II all he

147
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:36,390
has is a knife he just looks at a guy's

148
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:39,330
knife and it's like so tense you just

149
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:42,210
have no idea what he's gonna do and it's

150
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:43,770
not just a fake out he legitimately

151
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:45,690
comes through it just starts cutting

152
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:47,220
someone but it takes a really long time

153
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,620
and they're just like okay can we trust

154
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,960
you can we not you I think because you

155
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,610
really feel like you're in that car

156
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:55,110
there's not a sense of like we'll just

157
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:56,640
stop and kick him out or whatever like

158
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,460
it it doesn't look that easy absolutely

159
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,810
and what you said with time with

160
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:02,730
something that multiple times I was like

161
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,830
now that would have just been a jump to

162
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,660
like the next scene in the end the girl

163
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,430
after the dinner scene or before the

164
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,110
dinner scene she escapes she gets then

165
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,760
tied up by the guy at the gas station

166
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,470
and then she's in the car they're about

167
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:15,060
ready to go and he's like Oh left the

168
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,860
light on and you see him get up yeah

169
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:21,840
don't you're gonna light up why there is

170
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,490
so much time to take it throughout the

171
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:26,160
movie and I was like that would be so

172
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,200
different now and say I enjoy it it's

173
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,420
like immediately scary and funny at the

174
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,220
same time then just for no reason he's

175
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,930
just hit her with the broom stick it

176
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:35,100
what a dumb

177
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,790
than a broomstick so silly and strange

178
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,890
but also just so creepy because you do

179
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:42,750
feel like you're kind of there yeah and

180
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,170
it just lets you sit in that awful

181
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:47,850
disgustingness I would say the biggest

182
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:50,100
point for me with that is the dinner

183
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,800
scene just lingers so long actually

184
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,260
that's the one part I was almost getting

185
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,870
born there the grandma that was really

186
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:00,360
really uneasy like I was very like

187
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,630
creeped out by him I watched the second

188
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,700
one after I watched this one and they

189
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,350
got more of a budget and the grandpa got

190
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:08,700
better makeup and it was way less

191
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,010
effective okay no no here's what I was

192
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:12,600
wondering cuz I was watching this I'm

193
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,000
just like is that a mask or is that

194
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,500
supposed to be a skin I think is

195
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,750
creepier imagining that as a mask cuz

196
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,790
Leatherface wears a mask wait I always

197
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:23,040
thought Leatherface way over roar is

198
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,950
that music oh I didn't no idea that's

199
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:28,650
what Leatherface sounded like he always

200
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:30,810
danced at the end like I was giggling

201
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:32,880
throughout it's like really fun I love

202
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,830
that end sequence of her driving away

203
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,110
laughing and like him like doing like an

204
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:40,530
interpretive day I could tell he was

205
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:43,530
happier mad now like she got away with

206
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:46,170
you know he's like oh no he got away go

207
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:47,850
tell your friends anytime there's a

208
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:49,350
chase scene in this don't you be like

209
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:51,600
feel like he's right behind you like you

210
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,170
know Liam I really want you Ron run

211
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:57,210
closer get closer and that one scene at

212
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,950
the end it's just the truck is there and

213
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,810
she gets in when he's getting towards

214
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:04,650
the door like something about the way

215
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,210
they should it just really looks like

216
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:08,730
he's closed it he's gonna get you yeah

217
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:10,710
okay here's my question though get in

218
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:12,810
the truck they close they starts hitting

219
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:14,010
the door or whatever why didn't they

220
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:16,680
just drive off why why did they just

221
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,360
drive the hell out through the door

222
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,730
we'll just go out the other door the

223
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:25,230
best though is when he drives up and he

224
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:26,850
opens the door and he gets out he's like

225
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:28,920
what's going on that he sees Leatherface

226
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,620
of me and then the other car comes up

227
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,090
and they just run towards the other car

228
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:35,430
it just really feels chaotic I love when

229
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:37,440
she goes in the house which is army

230
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,669
great cuz you know there's nothing but

231
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:40,380
terror in there so I'm like well

232
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,669
whatever habit she goes in the house

233
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:42,990
she's dead she stays out there she's

234
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:44,400
dead just either way she's gonna be and

235
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,170
she actually lives but she goes in the

236
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:47,200
house

237
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,000
which was already great cuz he's chasing

238
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,130
after her and in horror movies they

239
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,300
always look out the window they're like

240
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,210
um she doesn't think she just dives out

241
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:58,180
the window yeah I feel like people going

242
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,220
in kinda know what it's gonna be it's

243
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:02,950
gonna be that exploitation style movie

244
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:05,020
that's super gritty and super you know

245
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:07,660
odd an uncomfortable kind of artsy that

246
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,700
yeah and you can see all these are films

247
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,870
that came from it like The Devil's

248
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,490
Rejects and stuff like that like just

249
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:15,010

250
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:16,930
