programming that you've come to know and

20
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:35,230
ladies in life

21
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:42,560
[Music]

22
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,200
so I have I have a dream that didn't

23
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,119
come out right I have a watch something

24
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:50,100
that I really wish I had that I don't

25
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,259
think exists in the world I want to be

26
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:54,390
able to take my cell phone plug it into

27
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,539
any computer and have an icon show up on

28
00:01:57,539 --> 00:02:00,479
that computer I double-click and the

29
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,509
computer unlike a new computer interface

30
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:05,610
opens up just running off of my cell

31
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,590
phone on the computer I want that to

32
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:10,019
work on my Samsung phones I want that to

33
00:02:10,019 --> 00:02:13,470
work on my on an iPhone does that make

34
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:14,640
sense though so you don't need to travel

35
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,350
with a computer you just travel with

36
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,090
your cell phone you plug it into any

37
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,980
computer and that computer then becomes

38
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,569
your computer which you carry in your

39
00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:22,980
pocket I don't think this will ever

40
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,470
exist because it would decimate the PC

41
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,630
market that said this is a perfect segue

42
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,040
to the first part of today's unboxing

43
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,739
video which which is going to be about

44
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:34,590
this apparatus that Samsung is also for

45
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,600
what it's worth I currently carry a

46
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,760
black Galaxy s8 I'm switching to a

47
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,799
silver one because all I didn't know

48
00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:41,970
they made a silver one I think it's

49
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:50,190
better-looking if you're a longtime

50
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,750
viewer of this show you know that I

51
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,880
always disclose when I'm being paid to

52
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:57,510
do something I am NOT being paid to make

53
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,970
this video but I do work with Samsung

54
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,380
and they put me in that commercial and

55
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,060
if I'm going to be totally honest with

56
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,980
you I just tweeted a couple weeks ago

57
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,019
that I was curious about this thing and

58
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:09,000
next thing I know Kelsey you know

59
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,650
Chelsea she's the girl everybody likes

60
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:13,470
it sent me a keyboard a mouse the deck

61
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,660
station in this ridiculous monitor so

62
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:20,489
this is an absolutely bias review take

63
00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:22,049
everything I say with a grain of salt

64
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:26,069
but uh okay let's just start it what

65
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:27,870
this is supposed to be is a way to plug

66
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:31,290
your well you plug well this apparatus

67
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:34,319
here becomes the dock for your phone so

68
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,810
you take this plug your phone in and

69
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,100
then in the back here you can plug this

70
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,079
into a monitor and a keyboard and then

71
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:41,400
this is supposed to operate as a

72
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:48,099
computer

73
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:50,840
what we have here is your basic Logitech

74
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,030
Bluetooth keyboard this is a bluetooth

75
00:03:53,030 --> 00:04:02,269
mouse calc yellow why you think I don't

76
00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:03,769
appreciate it this is a big enough

77
00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:11,290
monitor or what HDMI a lot of cable to

78
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:19,609
power cable just like an evening just

79
00:04:19,609 --> 00:04:23,300
 like a woman - alright thanks for

80
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,389
your tech support you turn it on

81
00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:33,639
ah power hey I changed screen resolution

82
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:37,729
so now this whole computer system here

83
00:04:37,729 --> 00:04:42,320
is based on my phone how to pair

84
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,840
aha that's the browser I have running

85
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:52,130
these are all my apps oh you're a new TV

86
00:04:52,130 --> 00:05:01,300
video you add Jesse and Jeana oh shoot

87
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:06,000
[Applause]

88
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,490
okay so just to be clear this is what my

89
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:16,660
phone playing on a monitor this is

90
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:19,150
YouTube playing on a monitor off my

91
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:21,730
phone control the computer and keyboard

92
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:23,650
of Jesse's new video all right Jesse I

93
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:24,760
love you I'm going to come watch Phoenix

94
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,980
watching that later this is very very

95
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,500
impressive so far Samsung alright so

96
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,850
moment of truth here this is really

97
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:32,950
important when it comes to this say I

98
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,210
have all this setup at home

99
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:37,960
I unplug it that's good that's how it

100
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:38,650
should work

101
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:40,390
except for now I can't access my phone

102
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,840
it just said yeah now here we go ready I

103
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:49,600
come home from work plug it in one one

104
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,010
thousand two one thousand three one

105
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:54,400
thousand four one thousand see I just

106
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,080
want to be able to plug it in have a

107
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:02,380
boot up and go okay alright that's

108
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,970
pretty it's hard to say where this is

109
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:06,520
super practical because you do have to

110
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,930
have this and then you have to have all

111
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:09,040
the cables and then you have to have

112
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,990
wireless Bluetooth and keyboards it's

113
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:12,730
not as simple as that idea that I want

114
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:13,840
where you just plug this into any

115
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,790
computer when you're at a hotel you're

116
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,530
at an airport or something like that you

117
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:19,000
boot this up plug it in when all you

118
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,890
have is this and it sort of acts as a

119
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:22,240
computer alright I know that was a

120
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,970
pretty abbreviated review but so far

121
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,770
pretty impressed with this thing Samsung

122
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:31,640
nicely done

123
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,250
[Music]

124
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,750
now there are a lot of packages here for

125
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,460
mail time but I'm going to go ahead and

126
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,050
begin with the bigger packages because

127
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:42,970
they take up the most space and I need

128
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:55,180
my space back Oh a dry erase channel

129
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,610
thank you whoever sent that to me just a

130
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:00,190
quick we are redoing all the branding

131
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:02,500
around beams so the old beam logo that

132
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,730
looks like this I don't wanna get too

133
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:05,470
nostalgic but that's not a thing of the

134
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:09,240
past

135
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,450

general I try to discourage this kind of

138
00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:27,400
thing this is the bag of dirt there's no

139
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,260

00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:33,310
probably some sort of joke haha hi case
