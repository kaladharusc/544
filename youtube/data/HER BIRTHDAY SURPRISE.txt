68
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,520
there's a lot of screaming all right

69
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,900
think they're gonna leave soon

70
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,580
I got a hide better so they don't see me

71
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,860
it's more special for her if I'm not

72
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:07,800
here

73
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,310
put on your birthday surprise Candace so

74
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:13,170
now they're just like going to a spa and

75
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,940
they get like a massage and their nails

76
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,430
done and I got pizza in there for them

77
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:19,380
and champagne and that's kind of it

78
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,030
that's the whole surprise but she seems

79
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:22,160
so excited

[Music]

81
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:27,860
there is nothing nothing like a

82
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,620
well-executed surprise one dime for my

83
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,210
brother vans birthday we had the

84
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:33,699
surprise party at a barbecue restaurant

85
00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:36,550
that was incredible

86
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:39,110
and then for Candace it's tricky cuz she

87
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:41,000
doesn't really like surprises so it has

88
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,009
to be like basically you have to give

89
00:04:43,009 --> 00:04:45,380
her exactly what she wants before she

90
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,599
asks for it which is by definition a

91
00:04:47,599 --> 00:04:54,240
surprise but there's some nuance there

92
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,860
storytime I haven't done storytime in a

93
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,450
while and since this morning was all

94
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:00,610
about Candis and today is her birthday I

95
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:05,440
thought I'd share Canada's story the

96
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,110
most common question about Candis is why

97
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:12,340
isn't she's smiling the thing that I

98
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,110
find most attractive about her is she

99
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:16,870
truly doesn't give two shits what

100
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:19,600
anybody thinks and to all of the ladies

101
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,340
that to all the people out there you

102
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,440
smile when you want to smile don't you

103
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,000
ever smile because somebody else tells

104
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,570
you to alright so this story is going

105
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:30,790
all the way back to 2008 that is eight

106
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:38,230
years ago this is what we were sort of

107
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,940
dating on and off this is when I was a

108
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,310
much crazier much more reckless Casey

109
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:49,030
and Candice was just 100% maniacs now

110
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,650
this is the first time that I was like

111
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,630
reconnecting with my old friends from

112
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:54,730
Connecticut who I knew before I became a

113
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,310
filmmaker and I wanted to make a

114
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,930
positive impression on them so I invited

115
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:02,230
Candace to this wedding she left an

116
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:08,020
impression I don't know how it's going

117
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,730
with those girls but I'm following their
