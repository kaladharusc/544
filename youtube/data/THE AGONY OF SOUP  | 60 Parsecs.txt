12
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,870
executing order 1961 if you flip that

13
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,239
upside down it's still 1961 new protocol

14

18
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,329
space is a bad idea if I know anything

19
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:55,890
about anecdotal evidence from the past

20
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,600
that suggested fire in space is probably

21
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,760
the worst thing you brought a little bit

22
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,980
I think I've made my point

23
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,460
welcome to Icarus 13 Space Station Astro

24
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:07,470

31
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:29,729

178
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:24,220
way your finger gun in most races bullet

179
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,740
here

180
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,560
[Music]

181
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,880
when you are young you are youing I

182
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,680
don't know what you're aiming out here

183
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,659
but it might be the uterus

184
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:36,510
what is this crafting module captain

185
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,039
it's important to keep yourself a new

186
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:40,500
crew well-fed one portion of delicious

187
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,539
canned soup is enough to sustain a human

188
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:44,760
for a few days even one can be the

189
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,890
difference between life and death that's

190
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:48,240
why it's important to keep a good

191
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,339
inventory of your stock unless you want

192
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:53,130
to each one of your crewmates haha that

193
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:53,850
was a joke

194
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:55,950
please appreciate it in laughs thank you

195
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:57,750
for your cooperation captain who'll

196
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,089
perform the routine supply check the

197
00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:02,520
only requirement is simple mathematics I

198
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,040
realize I might be asking a lot but I

199
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,540
have a good feeling about this crew

200
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,660
captain well I mean earn I the Smarty

hang on can I get some stats what does

202
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,339
this sanity is a sock puppet stops

203
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:16,500
insanity or so they say it doesn't say

204
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,300
what their intelligence is all about oh

205
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:26,370
he baby baby baby is an adult man bought

206

207
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,790
limber average fifth okay so she's

208
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:38,240
probably the most agile he's clever

209
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,709
strong and average so he's pretty good

210
00:09:40,709 --> 00:09:42,570
across the board formal child athlete

211
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:44,100
promising career was ended by an

212
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,140
untimely injury struggles to reinvent

213
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,640
herself but the reality is far from what

214
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,760
she imagined a man who was seen at all

215
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,320
sporting a dastard the eyepatch and a

216
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,510
coat of once magnificent blond hair Tom

217
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,160
believes to be everyone's dream come

218
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,810
true at the personification of the

219
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:59,760
American hero except no this is true

220
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,200

224
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,570
good news captain this shuttle came pre

225
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:17,370
stocked with an emergency food supply

226
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:20,100
use it well the routine supply check is

227
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,200
now complete well well look at that the

228
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,510
numbers add up good job human crew the

229
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,190
current number of soup cans on board is

230
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:28,770
5 correction the actual tally is

231
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:30,870
actually seven additional foodstuffs

232
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,430
were delivered to this shuttle instead

233
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:35,430
of entertainment supplies lucky you with

234
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:37,050
decent leadership and rational could

235
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:38,700
restraint the reserves of food on the

236
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,079
ship should be sufficient for the time

237
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,180
being that said it is in your best

238
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,950
interest to procure more as soon as

239
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:48,390
possible how are we how you do that how

240
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:50,490
do we do that captain the crafting

241
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:52,020
module in the back of the cabin has been

242
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,060
activated it's just like the Astro

243
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,130
citizen materials said it's wonderful

244
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:58,260
machine lets you create and destroy in

245
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,730
accordance with the principle of mass

246
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:02,040
conservation all you need it's a little

247
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,920
bit of minerals chemicals or power use

248
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,930
it to craft recycle and repair your

249
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:09,150
supplies as well as to upgrade items and

250
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:12,690

yesterday all right captain it's time

272
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,500
for a life-or-death challenge the most

273
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,270
humble tasks available on this ship

274
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:29,940
keeping the floor clean from specks of

275
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:32,339
melted Todd a small rubber scuff marks

276
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:34,500
the place could do with a good scrubbing

277
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,900
baby looks free will you ask him to

278
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,820
apply some elbow grease or request you

279
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,980
to improvise a cleaning formula from

280
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,230
whatever we have on board Oh baby gonna

281

basement baby once scrubbed a tree took

285
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:57,620

286
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:00,440

but I want to what I want to upgrade

295
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,410

296
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:30,290
like a smart I'm a smart or is anybody

297
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:30,950

worked away at even the smallest spots

309
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,350
of tough dirt down there on the floor

00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:55,619
disk and quarantined the virus I am

332
00:14:55,619 --> 00:14:57,149

captain

334
00:14:57,689 --> 00:14:59,429
we checked the asteroid from which the

335
00:14:59,429 --> 00:15:01,350
virus originated it was actually an

336
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:03,629
alien supply warehouse fortunately for

337
00:15:03,629 --> 00:15:07,319
us soup is universal crafting module

338
00:15:07,319 --> 00:15:08,939

339
00:15:08,939 --> 00:15:10,949

okay what did that do I have no idea

343
00:15:19,049 --> 00:15:20,790
what that actually did maybe it just

344
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:24,209
means it can make more armor atomic

345
00:15:24,209 --> 00:15:31,829
battery that seems nice okay seems

346

348
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:38,669
decide to ask him what's up cop

349
00:15:38,669 --> 00:15:40,860
no one's ever trusted me with anything

350
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:44,970
but my muscles my bag scrubbing muscles

351
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:47,459
all I ever hear is how I'm just a broad

352
00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:49,919
my parents used to say I always

353
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:52,199
strong-armed myself into more trouble

354
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:59,549

363
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:28,740
crisis of purpose you reassured him that

364
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,899
he's not a liability you said while his

365

brawn is useful his good nature and

366
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:34,560

eyes welled up you're the closest thing

369
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:43,350
I've ever had to a dad cap he said mine

370
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:45,959
didn't do much for me the only reason

371
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:48,360
I'm here is Mama and Papa Bronco gave me

372
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,480
up to the cops they left me in jail said

373
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,209
it wasn't even theirs but I scrub them

374
00:16:54,209 --> 00:16:55,439
out of existence

375
00:16:55,439 --> 00:16:57,689
you both got a bit emotional and Bronco

376
00:16:57,689 --> 00:16:59,579
laid his massive head on your shoulder

377
00:16:59,579 --> 00:17:00,959
you don't remember feeling this

378
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,360
protective of anyone or anything

379
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,039
baby express his feelings for you love

380
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:13,039
is oh he said that I was like the dad

381
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:16,620
maybe he was calling me daddy maybe I

382
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:20,010
misinterpreted that I don't know what

383
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:22,169
the atomic battery does but I've got it

384
00:17:22,169 --> 00:17:25,169
now and I think I need to make some soup

385
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:28,079
wash your favorite thing baby ask you

386
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,960

387
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,200
Oh like this he said reaching into his

388
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,909
suit collar and produced a little toy

389
00:17:35,909 --> 00:17:39,059
superhero branded the Soviet soccer he

390
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:41,490
says this was the only toys parents let

391
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:43,500
him have and that when they made him do

392
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,270
bad stuff he'd imagine he was the

393
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:49,200
all-american hero was yours baby asks

394
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,059
again captain he is glancing

395
00:17:51,059 --> 00:17:53,010
suspiciously around the cabin is he

396
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:55,650
harboring a secret as far as I know the

397
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,360
only thing you care about right now on

398
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,270
the board is DIY equipment Oh duct tape

399
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:02,130
duct tape is everybody's best friend you

400
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:03,690
can always do what you need to do with

405
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:16,500
asks you to give him something you

406
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,559
gestured to the duct tape roller okay he

407
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:21,929
bumbled baby took the roll carefully

408
00:18:21,929 --> 00:18:24,330
with a boyish grin he reached behind the

409
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:25,679
crafting module to reveal some

410
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,570
components he's been sitting there for a

411
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:29,429
while he got to work on a few hours

412
00:18:29,429 --> 00:18:31,350
plugging things together methodically

413
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:34,930
before giving you brand-new upgraded

414
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:46,600
Oh baby baby your daughter's you

415
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,800
sweetheart

416
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:54,280
baby baby upgraded the tape baby good

417
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:58,000
babe baby boy okay I got one soup that

418
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,580
was it though alright one soup that

419
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,750
wasn't as much as I thought it was gonna

420
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,840
be captain dee dee is bored so bored she

421
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,820
doesn't want to bother you so she won't

422
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,650
complain she just looks around in sighs

423
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:11,470
loudly if you trust she would not damage

424
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:13,270
anything you could encourage her to

425
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:15,370
tinker with something on board maybe you

426
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:16,870
would help her escape the black hole of

427
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:19,810
boredom for a little while all right I

428
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:22,480
wish I had that artifact now not that I

429
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,900
really want an upgraded artifact but

430
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:28,750
yeah we go I guess now I guess I'll make

431
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:33,340
some more sue also wears this weird

432
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,800
chemical flask on are we recycling our

433
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,020
piss back into soup I guess if you could

434
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,330
just preserve mass that would make sense

435
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:42,040
right if you're always just making soup

436
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,720
and you're peeing enough and you're

437
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,340
pooping enough you could turn that poop

438
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:49,660
and pee back into soup and pee right I

439
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:54,580
guess recycling I guess sure yeah I'm

440
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,690
gonna make an artifact

441
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:57,520
all right everybody still good everyone

442
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,630
still not no one's hungry so that's good

443
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:02,110
all right

444
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,100
they're probably gonna be hungry

445
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:06,010
tomorrow no no they seemed okay when you

446
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:07,240
hand EBD the mask

447
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,190
she looks so pleased she told you she

448
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:11,110
wore all sorts of fun outfits during a

449
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:13,090
figure skating career she used to have a

450
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:14,800
knack for showing him jazzing up her

451
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,750
outfits I'm happy to report crew may

452
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,520
dawkins spruced up the dusty masts

453
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,230
significantly using some bits and

454
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:24,640
baubles she found on board oh wow thank

455
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,980
you so nice of you

456
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:31,750
fullfil wow that's impressive thank you

457
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,030
oh is it time for expeditions I guess

458
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:36,460
your attention is required captain this

459
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:38,350
is most abnormal we are registering

460
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:40,240
unknown transmissions but I cannot

461
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,920
identify who's sending them and more

462
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,110
importantly what they contain it might

463
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,720
be a solar flare interference or worse a

464
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,300
new type of Soviet in

465
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,190
Crypton we need to decipher these

466
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:52,140
signals as soon as possible for all we

467
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,000
know our survival depends on it who do

468
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,290
you want to put in charge of monitoring

469
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:57,270
the communications I guess me cuz I'm

470
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:59,370
the smartest right that's what that

471
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:01,080
would seem like right I'm gonna go with

472
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,880
a big ol YES on that one yeah it's

473
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,200

474
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,180
everyone's suit cuz I'm just that

475

okay I'm gonna give everyone soup I know

479
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,680

480
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:35,150
just gonna do it because I want to do it

about that yeah first contact captain

486
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:53,370
you need to see this I'm not easily

487
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:55,650
excited but this is one of the greatest

488
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:57,660
moments for humanity and human made a

489
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:00,150
higher like we are not alone in this

490
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:02,270
universe well we did see that alien

491
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:05,100
Depot back the other way anyway whatever

492
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,560
the signals we intercepted we're finally

493
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,230
decrypted they are alien transmissions

494
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:13,110
as in coming from other life-forms and

495
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:16,080
no I do not mean the Reds it's something

496
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,880
we have never seen before there seems to

497
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,740
be a number of intelligent civilizations

498
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:24,330
in the galaxy decision see sorry bug in

499
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:25,830
my system the signals are coming from

500
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:27,540
everywhere we can safely assume we are

501
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,980
going to meet some of them sooner or

502
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:32,130
later our or rather your life will never

503
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:34,110
be the same captain you did a splendid

504
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:36,480
job the electromagnetic interferences

505
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,430
that you trace point to what seemed to

506
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:40,470
be a potential landing spot for our

507
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:43,110
flight path our eta for that celestial

508
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:45,300
body whatever it might be is t-minus

509
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,580
four babies still your friend baby is

510
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,080
still your soulmate crafting complete

511
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,760
baby has been taking care of his mental

512
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,590
health and is now alert dee dee

513
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:54,930
oh good they're all luck then good no

514
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:57,690
more finger gun no finger gun today okay

515
00:22:57,690 --> 00:22:59,490
whatever you say ma'am Tom says his

516
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:00,850
favorite thing to do during

517
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:02,890
downtime is a tarantula trainer on a

518
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:05,080
highly classified CIA secret weapons

519
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,840
project was fought around with his

520
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,490
company's equipment to try and make it

521
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:11,350
work better I've never heard of this

522
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:13,750
idiom before captain I hope he means to

523
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,970
tinker and not to actually flatulate on

524
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:18,040
delicate ik electronic devices he's

525
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,320
offering to fart around with some of our

526
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,690
items - I haven't detected any methane

527
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:24,910
spikes in our air supply recently so I

528
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:26,830
believe he is using a metaphorical

529
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,810
version of his phrase will you give Tom

530
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:33,430
anything to tinker with yeah fart on the

531
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:36,760
gun I guess if you shove that gun up

532
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:41,470
your ass and shoot it in if you if you

533
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:44,050
kill yourself by trying to fart into

534
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:45,820
that gun by shoving it up your ass I'm

535
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:49,030
gonna be very very upset with you Tom

536
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:51,970
just saying that right now I will be

537
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:58,330
very pissed off don't do that don't you

538
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:00,760
give Tom the gun to fart around with Tom

539
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,440
spend several hours with it taking it

540
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,120
apart putting it back together when he

541
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,320
was finished the gun looked and

542
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,060
functioned significantly better than

543
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:11,320
before oh that's nice okay captain are

544
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,240
you all right those weird spots on your

545
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,460
arms are a little worrisome can you see

546
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,230
them please wait while I search through

547
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:18,940
the medical database searching

548
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,680
unfortunately I am unable to identify

549
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,630
your affliction I'm afraid you will have

550
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:24,460
to diagnose it yourself that shouldn't

551
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,030
be too hard

552
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:27,010
doctors are overrated can you do that

553
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:30,040
captain oh yeah I got a book I guess I

554
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:34,330
could do with the book okay I'm gonna do

555
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:36,610
with the book there we go

556
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:38,740
also we got a fart gun yeah we do we

557
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:39,910
definitely have a fart gun

558
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:41,650
we had spots appeared on your body

559
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:43,720
yesterday luckily you found the solution

560
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,520
in the handbook the spots were a first

561
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,500
symptom of a potentially dangerous and

562
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:50,530
highly shameful ailment at least it was

563
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:52,570
easy to cure all you needed to do is for

564
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:54,040
all the step-by-step instructions in the

565
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,660
handbook planet or no planet whatever

566
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:58,210
fine it was getting closer okay

567
00:24:58,210 --> 00:24:59,980
we are experiencing minor technical

568
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:01,420
difficulties with the communications

569
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:03,130
console in other word we are completely

570
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:05,410
deaf and blind I cannot pinpoint the

571
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:06,880
origin at this malfunction but I am

572
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,070
registering an intensifying tonal signal

573
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:11,590
captain it's a bomb oh the captain

574
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:13,060
countdown will be over soon do something

575
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:14,060
sure it

576
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:17,210
the fart gun fart gun shoot shoot shoot

577
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:18,950
it I'm gonna upgrade this battery

578
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:25,520
upgrade the book battery lighter but

579
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,180
battery there we go I don't know what's

580
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,710
shooting it's gonna do but we're gonna

581
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:33,290
shoot it cuz that's how I roll baby

582
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:35,360
there is nothing that can't be solved

583
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,430
with violence apparently at least that's

584
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:39,380
my take on you repeatedly firing the gun

585
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,910
at the communications console and the

586
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:42,650
bomb congratulations the bomb was

587
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:44,570
disabled in the gunfire frenzy we

588
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:45,200
survived

589
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,850
unfortunately you damaged other things

590
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:50,330
in the cabins well of course it Oh what

591
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:53,900
did I damage what did I damage doesn't

592
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,030
look like anything's hurt looks like

593
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:57,530
everything's fine you big baby

594
00:25:57,530 --> 00:26:00,530
upgrade or the communicator I'll grab

595
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:02,630
the communicator why not baby looks

596
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:05,720
upset captain he says when he feels sad

597
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,970
he does exercise but that's not easy in

598
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:10,100
the shuttle whether he was in the prison

599
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,990
gym or occasionally attending football

600
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:13,790
practice exercise was always an escape

601
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,500
for him he says one of the few things

602
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,210
his parents would let him do was visit

603
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:19,730
the gym suddenly he looks at you sharply

604
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:22,040
and begins hopping up and down he asks

605
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,170
if he can press you like a barbell

606
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:26,150
probably one of the strange requests

607
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:28,130
you'll receive on this trip sir oh my

608
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:29,000
god

609
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,260
baby wants to press me oh my baby please

610
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:35,540
we don't have a separate room in this

611
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:40,420
shuttle it's just us oh my god I guess I

612
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:43,160
guess I might be down for a little of

613
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,980
excitement in this horrible situation we

614
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,810
have ourselves in I I suppose you know

615
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:49,820
if it's for your best interest I'll let

616
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:52,940
you press me you agreed to let baby turn

617
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:57,050
you into a barbell good good he wheezed

618
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:59,210
as you were elevated and descended

619
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:01,250
repeatedly and then elevated and

620
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:03,860
descended again repeatedly with him

621
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:07,460
wheezing good God over and over again

622
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:10,280
you were repeatedly ascended descended

623
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:14,780
elevated de elevated good god he wheezed

624
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:17,330
through his teeth as he turned you into

625
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:19,360
a barbell Oh

626
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,250
anyway after baby use you for a big

627
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:25,460
session a big session of elevating and

628
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,130
descending

629
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:30,670
good god big li he said in a session

630
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:34,540
he'll set you softly on the ground you

631
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:40,900
okay cap you were shaking like a leaf he

632
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,630
ripped a sock out of his suits inner

633
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:47,110
lining they left an extra in my dorm on

634
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:50,470
the station I'm assuming sock is just a

635
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:54,040
euphemism for condom in the situation he

636
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:59,020
said and made a puppet and stuck his

637
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:03,640
hand in the sock and made a puppet with

638
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,830
it he handed you the puppet with a grin

639
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:14,910
baby continues to think if he was so me

640
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:17,140
no one seems hungry yet

641
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,760
so I guess maybe I was over feeding him

642
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,730
what is that a strange new world I guess

643
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:23,200
I can make armor it's the only thing we

644
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,840
have left captain wake up we're

645
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,640
approaching some sort of celestial body

646
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,650
it resembles a moon but I think it's a

647
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:32,920
small planet let me run a quick scan 96

648
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,410
98 100 scanning complete oh it's right a

649
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:37,570
small rocky planet with no organic

650
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:39,760
life-forms but there's a lot of movement

651
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,860
down there strange my scanners detect

652
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:44,100
some caves in rock formations below

653
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,090
captain if you want to land on this

654
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:47,890
planet safely you will have to fix up a

655
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:49,630
small malfunction in thar steering

656
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:51,640
system since we're not even able to turn

657
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,230
at the moment oh and you will have to do

658
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:56,429
it before we float away from the planet

659
00:28:56,429 --> 00:28:59,830

660
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:02,650

00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:18,760
69 is that your objective here oh it's

666
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:22,030

667
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:22,630

I'll count in 69 okay book wins okay

669
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:27,580
we'll do the book but if this turns out

670
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:29,290
to be wrong I'm gonna be real pissed

671
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:31,420

Papa could baba would have been fine and

674
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:42,110
again people still although hungry which

675
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:43,700
makes me think I was over feeding him or

676
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,950
maybe it collected all of the feeding

677
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,660
that I did see you can't really waste

678
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:50,630
cuz body fats a thing okay this better

679
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:52,070
work if this doesn't work I'm gonna be

680
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:55,280
real pissed and we really really really

681
00:29:55,280 --> 00:30:02,060
pissed okay here we go Oh oh shit oh God

682
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:04,160
you flip through your trusty handbook

683
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,110
looking for some kind of manual or at

684
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:07,760
least how to land a spaceship for

685
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,320
dummies Shepherd not sure if it was your

686
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,720
fast reading skills or pure luck but you

687
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,920
opened the book to the right page

688
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,600
following the instructions you

689
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,250
reconnected some cables and steer the

690
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:18,170
shuttle towards the ground it was not a

691
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:20,450
soft landing nobody's doing great after

692
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:22,910
the stunt not even me I'm shaking too my

693
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:25,910
cause yes all of them your face had a

694
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:27,530
pretty unpleasant close encounter with

695
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:29,870
our communicator module and at least one

696
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,310
of these things is useless now

697
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:33,620
considering fixing it if you want to

698
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:36,290
avoid radio silence in the future what's

699
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:38,780
next captain and maybe you could use the

700
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,460
information I found while scanning the

701
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:42,290
environment there are robotic units not

702
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:44,540
far from here but my scan detected very

703
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:46,880
aggressive signatures I think these are

704
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,330
peaceful automatons right okay most of

705
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:52,130
them perhaps they can be of help to you

706
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:54,230
and in case you perish at least I'll

707
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:57,010
have company so it's a win-win situation

708
00:30:57,010 --> 00:30:59,060
okay you might want to secure your

709
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:00,920
rations for yourself dee dee would like

710
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,390
to eat something okay they're hungry now

711
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:05,840
so now I can give them some food okay

712
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,580
find an appropriate landing spot so we

713
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:11,690
first there instructions okay you know

714
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:13,820
you said you detected no life but oh I

715
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:17,530
guess robots that would make sense

716
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:20,330
look at that they put a unique low

717
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:24,860
jacket on a spacesuit what a stupid

718
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:25,580
piece of crap

719
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:27,470
I always think they look stupid those

720
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:30,140
are doing making soup

721
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:33,140
did I get anything damaged I mean that's

722
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:35,360
damage captain the expedition module in

723
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,920
the back of the cabin has been activated

724
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,380
my advise order someone to put the space

725
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:41,660
suit on and send them outside we must

726
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:43,190
learn everything we can about this place

727
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:45,559
one small step for a true citizen one

728
00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:47,090
giant leap for whatever's left of

729
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:48,970
humanity okay thank you

730
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:52,309
all right Wow well I don't like this

731
00:31:52,309 --> 00:31:54,410
statute I don't like anything here two

732
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:58,040
of twelve looked what village ooh

733
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:01,220
chance for tourist information chance

734
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:08,540
for energy what okay what is that what

735
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:10,790
the Hat what's a hazard what's that what

736
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:12,620
is that hazard what's that hazard do I

737
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,630
need energy or do I need it material I

738
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:16,429
don't really need materials I've made

739
00:32:16,429 --> 00:32:18,500
everything I need grass that's not a

740
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:22,340
hazard okay grass then what does the

741
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:25,429
grass do hazard from Shrek and his swamp

742
00:32:25,429 --> 00:32:27,710
yeah it seems likely I guess tourist

743
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:31,640
information why not uh it does look like

744
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:34,340
grass which isn't a hazard the other one

745
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:37,070
was obviously radiation rocky terrain my

746
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:39,980
left nut that is not rocky don't worry

747
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:42,049
about it I'm gonna worry about our didi

748
00:32:42,049 --> 00:32:45,559
you're going oh I see I see I see

749
00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:50,559
oh it seems like being agile and limber

750
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:54,830
would be best right Tom Thomson his last

751
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:57,799
name is Thompson Tom Thompson all right

752
00:32:57,799 --> 00:33:00,010
we're gonna send didi

753
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:04,679
and you're gonna have oh that's right

754
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:06,100
okay

755
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:09,160
ah okay armor and a gun that seems

756
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:13,150
pretty basic right armor gun maybe you

757
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:14,230
need the mask

758
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:16,150
maybe the mask would be better than

759
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:21,340
armor I don't know ah Dee Dee's gonna go

760
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:23,169
let's go armor let's go armor let's go

761
00:33:23,169 --> 00:33:24,669
armor I think that's probably the best

762
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:27,970
okay so you're all hungry so I'm gonna

763
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:28,330
make sure

764
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:31,360
dinis fed before she goes or else she's

765
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,350
gonna starve

766
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:35,559
righty-ho here we go can't you do

767
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:38,620
anything about this it seems fine

768
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:42,100
oh this duh need to make soup it's

769
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:45,100
probably okay it's probably fine if

770
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,630
you're going to send an expedition why

771
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:48,580
not do it it style

772
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:50,350
remember to upgrade your expedition

773
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:52,360
module dee dee left to check out the

774
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,400
most logical location to visit the

775
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,410
tourist info let's hope she find

776
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:58,299
something more than dusty brochures and

777
00:33:58,299 --> 00:34:03,730
tacky souvenirs so now we wait and also

778
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:07,840
we're out of shit systems disabled why

779
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,149
captain something's not right there's an

780
00:34:10,149 --> 00:34:11,889
uncontrolled power surge in the crafting

781
00:34:11,889 --> 00:34:14,139
module I cannot do anything to stop it

782
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:15,970
also I can't do anything at all cuz I'm

783
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:18,040
a computer this is no accident it's

784
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,090
sabotage

785
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:21,010
someone needs to fix it immediately or

786
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:25,690
it's going to blow honey or I'll fix it

787
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:27,820
as the leader okay

788
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:30,429
that's all we need to do right crafting

789
00:34:30,429 --> 00:34:32,790
systems down don't blow up please

790
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:35,409
amazing captain not only did you stop

791
00:34:35,409 --> 00:34:36,909
the power search in the crafting module

792
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:38,980
but you also upgraded it in the process

793
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:41,230
somehow captain stay alert this may

794
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:41,679
happen again

795
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,419
who did it which one of you was you Tom

796
00:34:43,419 --> 00:34:45,790
Thompson it wouldn't be my lover who

797
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:48,609
elevated me and descended me repeatedly

798
00:34:48,609 --> 00:34:51,629
up top guard guard he yelled as I was

799
00:34:51,629 --> 00:34:54,460
elevating me raising me lowering me

800
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:56,320
raising me as he turned me into a

801
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,530
barbell guard guard he yelled or

802
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:02,170
whispered but it felt like yelling was

803
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:04,050
it so strong he yelled

804
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:06,600
when I was far away and then God went up

805
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:10,040
up near his ear oh so good and not good

806
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,220
okay

807
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:15,090
Oh God I got a hammer a spatula and a

808
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:17,490
tutor Oh penis I don't know how that

809
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:21,900
happened but uh shovel okay sure

810
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,780
shovel I guess captain we were able to

811
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:27,120
detect transmissions of unknown origin

812
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,040
unfortunately the communications console

813
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,260
was damaged during landing and we cannot

814
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:33,030
make anything out of them or reply for

815
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:34,470
that matter we could hardwire a

816
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:36,480
primitive field communicator to bypass

817
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,730
the ax damaged subsystems and access the

818
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:40,560
external external transmitter and

819
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,740
receiver yeah do that that sounds yeah

820
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,150
do that why wouldn't you do that do that

821
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:48,510
Jesus Christ just do that whatever do it

822
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:55,560
good God hello world great success

823
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,330
captain if the communicator attached to

824
00:35:57,330 --> 00:35:58,710
the communications console worked like a

825
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:00,960
charm how about just the aesthetics

826
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,460
since we can finally receive an answer

827
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,620
transmissions now all we need to do is

828
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,870
wait for someone to contact us someone

829
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:09,330
will find us eventually the crew is

830
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:11,550
visibly excited by this incredible feat

831
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:12,330
of Engineering

832
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:14,520
they were only slightly smirking while

833
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,020
looking at the patch communication

834
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:18,270
control tomorrow will be great captain

835
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:20,190
you need to be cautious this is yet

836
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:23,190
another sabotage attempt well wait what

837
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:24,470
was another

838
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:27,900
what what was another sabotage attempt

839
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:30,240
it was already broken beforehand why

840
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,430
would why would it

841
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:35,670
what captain I am detecting troubling

842
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:38,220
buildup of mental tension recommended

843
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:40,830
course of action throw an epic party I

844
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:42,450
took the liberty of inviting myself

845
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:45,450
invite the entire crew but of course the

846
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:47,970
more the merrier I guess how about we

847
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:50,190
invite someone new captain someone you

848
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:52,410
don't know or we make ourselves a new

849
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:56,310
companion yes how do we do it with this

850
00:36:56,310 --> 00:37:05,840
used sock it's a sock definitely a sock

851
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:11,330
yep first peppers ready then the day

852
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:14,460
lunk that was one super party captain I

853
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,140
loved how you put a sock on your hand

854
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:18,390
yesterday and pretended it's a person of

855
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:21,450
a serious mary-jane apparently you've

856
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:23,940
had quite a lively debate with it - well

857
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:26,160
desperation breeds unexpected chat mates

858
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:26,940
doesn't it

859
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,620
I found it little weird when teams

860
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:29,910
started arguing with the sock and

861
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:31,710
eventually taught apart you've got quite

862
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:33,660
a temper captain the important part is

863
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:36,300
you blew off some steam you are still

864
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:41,220
very mentally stable okay I think I'm

865
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:45,390
giving people too much food but that's

866
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:49,160
okay probably they're only hungry and we

867
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:52,650
really don't have any food to spare and

868
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:54,900
we have yet to piss out all the

869
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:57,870
necessary supplies for another can so I

870
00:37:57,870 --> 00:38:00,030
think we're fucked I'm gonna give them

871
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:02,490
food anyway interesting news captain it

872
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:03,930
appears that there's a hollow space

873
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:06,030
behind one of the wall panels a hidden

874
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:08,730
room maybe a secret stash it would be

875
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:10,350
worth checking out what's your approach

876
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:12,270
to finding out what's behind your panel

877
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:14,700
my agility I'm gonna do a double

878
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:17,130
backflip while smacking that panel on

879
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:20,490
its ass it's one poor get rocked by my

880
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:23,160
good Chile's I'm so limber right baby

881
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:27,150
why he good limber his legs move reel up

882
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:29,380
and around my

883
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:31,959
anyway eat damn you but we're blowing

884
00:38:31,959 --> 00:38:33,759
around after this one yeah we're gonna

885
00:38:33,759 --> 00:38:36,459
recycle we're gonna turned every bodily

886
00:38:36,459 --> 00:38:38,949
fluid I have back into soup I have done

887
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:41,829
every day yesterday I brought your

888
00:38:41,829 --> 00:38:43,180
attention to the hidden space behind the

889
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:45,459
panels you did your best access it but

890
00:38:45,459 --> 00:38:46,089
to no avail

891
00:38:46,089 --> 00:38:48,519
oh shit we will probably never learn

892
00:38:48,519 --> 00:38:50,229
what's on the other side my computation

893
00:38:50,229 --> 00:38:52,119
suggests there's only one percent chance

894
00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:53,769
of there being any treasure like a

895
00:38:53,769 --> 00:38:56,680
really big soup can in short definitely

896
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,579
not worth the trouble

897
00:38:57,579 --> 00:38:59,319
dee dee has returned safely from a trip

898
00:38:59,319 --> 00:39:01,029
she says she's a bit hungry when

899
00:39:01,029 --> 00:39:03,009
scanning a body had to Tek some mental

900
00:39:03,009 --> 00:39:05,170
imbalances and a little weakness the

901
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:06,910
path was a tricky one the uneven surface

902
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:08,680
of this planet makes it really easy to

903
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,989
trip and fall the armor has lost the

904
00:39:10,989 --> 00:39:14,739
battle against sharp rocks oh well shit

905
00:39:14,739 --> 00:39:16,809
the outpost was mostly empty save for

906
00:39:16,809 --> 00:39:19,539
one board dusty robot who gave dee dee a

907
00:39:19,539 --> 00:39:21,789
few power cells as a welcome gift the

908
00:39:21,789 --> 00:39:23,349
tourist center employee explained the

909
00:39:23,349 --> 00:39:25,209
dee dee in every series of board beeps

910
00:39:25,209 --> 00:39:27,160
and distorted words the weight of the

911
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,259
museum in the library who transported

912
00:39:29,259 --> 00:39:30,759
these outside our solar system

913
00:39:30,759 --> 00:39:33,339
so strange anyway dee dee came back

914
00:39:33,339 --> 00:39:35,469
carrying rations Dee said the place was

915
00:39:35,469 --> 00:39:37,209
a little neglected in almost-empty say

916
00:39:37,209 --> 00:39:39,579
for that one rusty employee the tourism

917
00:39:39,579 --> 00:39:41,289
industry isn't exactly booming on this

918
00:39:41,289 --> 00:39:43,900
planet you don't need extra rations for

919
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:48,279
now baby is doing ok soup wise nice ok

920
00:39:48,279 --> 00:39:51,009
then we still don't have enough for more

921
00:39:51,009 --> 00:39:55,119
soup dee dee is tired but not hungry yet

922
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:57,369
long-term space travel presents many

923
00:39:57,369 --> 00:39:59,920
risks to one's physical well-being from

924
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,589
muscular atrophy to laziness to die it's

925
00:40:02,589 --> 00:40:05,170
notoriously high in sodium I'm concerned

926
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:06,400
about the decline I've seen in the

927
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,440
entire crews physical fitness since our

928
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,049
little sojourn began I recommend a daily

929
00:40:11,049 --> 00:40:13,059
regimen of movements that use only your

930
00:40:13,059 --> 00:40:14,529
own body weight you don't need any

931
00:40:14,529 --> 00:40:16,479
equipment for those just gravity or

932
00:40:16,479 --> 00:40:18,910
artificial gravity any volunteers for a

933
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:22,900
workout well baby loves workout baby

934
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,999
gonna work out baby like working out

935
00:40:24,999 --> 00:40:27,699
baby like work out real good should we

936
00:40:27,699 --> 00:40:34,329
go what is that like a demon symbol or

937
00:40:34,329 --> 00:40:36,340
their demons in there

938
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:41,380
oh here we go hazards dorkness the

939
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:43,000
hazard is dorkness

940
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,910
I don't know what can help dorkness but

941
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:47,890
I don't know why it's full of darkness

942
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:50,350
and this one's full of demons but I need

943
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:54,040
the liquid for soup oh yeah baby's

944
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,880
working all right Tom Thompson you're up

945
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,400
you intelligent bastard Tom's gonna be

946
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,280
the one for this all right Tom you're

947
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:08,440
gonna take this and if its door no

948
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:11,650
lighter four light light up the dark

949
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:15,310
darkness around you you got a light up

950
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:20,650
the darkness oh it's a smart God the

951
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:23,800
darkness I guess I'd be it I'm gonna

952
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,990
take the armor I guess just cuz that

953
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:27,430
generally seems like a good idea I

954
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:28,840
thought they said the armor lost the

955
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:31,390
fight but apparently apparently not I

956
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:34,920
don't want to recycle anything upgrade

957
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,450
double let's upgrade the ball quite

958
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:40,410
hungry nobody's hungry nobody's hungry

959
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:41,770
nobody's hungry

960
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:46,710
I'm vigorous I changed my mind

961
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:49,270
Tom you're gonna carry the gun there's

962
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:51,310
one thing that dorkness needs its gun

963
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:53,170
that's the answer to that question all

964
00:41:53,170 --> 00:41:54,190
right let's do this

965
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:57,640
chunk man I'm so good at this game

966
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,490
babies form was impeccable pull ups

967
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:02,320
plank squats and lunges in this

968
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,510
environment he even had to wait by

969
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:06,070
lifting the spare parts for the shuttle

970
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:09,340
sweaty and roaring baby crushed that

971
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:11,230
workout like an empty can of soup the

972
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:12,820
automated automated system predicted

973
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:15,130
benefits for being a model Astro citizen

974
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:17,620
a hidden dispenser opened and spit out

975
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:20,200
two soup cans I'm sorry to report there

976
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,600
are only two surplus cans hidden aboard

977
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:26,410
this ship for our there okay cool Hey

978
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:30,040
cosmos 102 that's so nice and didi is

979
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:37,279
not hungry

980
00:42:37,279 --> 00:42:39,779
okay let's upgrade the armor all right

981
00:42:39,779 --> 00:42:41,430
well we are captain Ellis a pair of

982
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:43,739
robots on meandering towards us they are

983
00:42:43,739 --> 00:42:45,660
facing each other and appear to be fused

984
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:47,729
at the hands when it's a large Hulk

985
00:42:47,729 --> 00:42:49,589
dragging the other which is smaller in

986
00:42:49,589 --> 00:42:51,749
stature could this be a parent-child

987
00:42:51,749 --> 00:42:54,630
pair the big droid thugs along in one

988
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:56,579
leg after the other as if low on power

989
00:42:56,579 --> 00:42:59,160
while the little one pieces fumes from

990
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,619
his back one has a power socket the

991
00:43:01,619 --> 00:43:04,229
other a mouth like receiving chamber do

992
00:43:04,229 --> 00:43:05,940
you wish to charge the big robot feed

993
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:07,680
the little one or leave them to their

994
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,809
Freight case I'll charge the big one

995
00:43:09,809 --> 00:43:12,450
then feel bad for the little one but I I

996
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:14,549
don't think soup would be good to shove

997
00:43:14,549 --> 00:43:17,489
in the gob of a random Robo I'll charge

998
00:43:17,489 --> 00:43:20,309
him up with my battery and people are

999
00:43:20,309 --> 00:43:21,359
still not hungry

1000
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:23,670
well goody good for us goodie good for

1001
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:26,039
us okay let's do this see what happens I

1002
00:43:26,039 --> 00:43:27,779
don't know what that's gonna do my

1003
00:43:27,779 --> 00:43:29,489
battery seems better for a robot then

1004
00:43:29,489 --> 00:43:31,650
soup you would lock the battery over to

1005
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:34,079
the Robo Renton Robo kid who is slowly

1006
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:36,329
trudging past the shuttle once you plug

1007
00:43:36,329 --> 00:43:37,680
the unit into the father Bart it's

1008
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,209
straighten its back and sprung with

1009
00:43:39,209 --> 00:43:41,339
energy the hulking machine bowed in

1010
00:43:41,339 --> 00:43:43,259
thanks and with renewed energy picked up

1011
00:43:43,259 --> 00:43:44,699
the weak little robot next to it and

1012
00:43:44,699 --> 00:43:47,130
sprinted into the distance I hope their

1013
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:48,749
journey isn't just one of those fatherly

1014
00:43:48,749 --> 00:43:51,719
character building exercises okay

1015
00:43:51,719 --> 00:43:54,359
alright well everyone's hungry now don't

1016
00:43:54,359 --> 00:43:55,799
know what the benefit of all that was

1017
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:58,650
but okay oh we can make one soup good

1018
00:43:58,650 --> 00:44:02,039
one delicious soup sir one of our crew

1019
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:03,749
spotted something strange in the

1020
00:44:03,749 --> 00:44:05,699
neighborhood a Space Ghost floating

1021
00:44:05,699 --> 00:44:07,380
towards our boat with purpose are we a

1022
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:09,239
carrying anything mysterious it might be

1023
00:44:09,239 --> 00:44:13,709
interested yes this weird cow don't know

1024
00:44:13,709 --> 00:44:17,549
why we made it but we've got it so their

1025
00:44:17,549 --> 00:44:19,319
soup for us

1026
00:44:19,319 --> 00:44:23,160
wha-bam perfect love the way I end my

1027
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,619
days the Space Ghost phase towards you

1028
00:44:25,619 --> 00:44:28,049
waiting a protoplasmic microphone you

1029
00:44:28,049 --> 00:44:30,390
have to the artifact at it and exploded

1030
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:33,630
in a mess of slime well done sir okay

1031
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:35,729
who else would the crew call and

1032
00:44:35,729 --> 00:44:42,589
ghosties Oh Space Ghost Coast to Coast

1033
00:44:42,589 --> 00:44:46,970
the host with the most space

1034
00:44:46,970 --> 00:44:52,349
microphone ah bring a sock puppet to

1035
00:44:52,349 --> 00:44:53,609
transmitted coordinates what does that

1036
00:44:53,609 --> 00:44:55,369
even I don't have a sock

1037
00:44:55,369 --> 00:44:59,369
Oh sock requires fluids

1038
00:44:59,369 --> 00:45:01,740
since when captain a transmission we

1039
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,480
received while you were asleep I took

1040
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,160
the liberty of decoding the message for

1041
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,869
you what I found with geographical

1042
00:45:06,869 --> 00:45:09,779
coordinates I don't have any so screw me

1043
00:45:09,779 --> 00:45:15,390
huh I can't do nothing I can upgrade the

1044
00:45:15,390 --> 00:45:24,589
shovel the medkit shovel the shovel

1045
00:45:24,589 --> 00:45:29,700
shovel fetish a big shovel wider shovel

1046
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:32,880
shovel axe a shavax when you reach the

1047
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,349
location from the transmission

1048
00:45:34,349 --> 00:45:36,660
coordinates you could see somebody

1049
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:38,789
sneaking off into the dark behind a big

1050
00:45:38,789 --> 00:45:40,920
rock a little suspicious although you

1051
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,359
did not bring the sock puppet the

1052
00:45:42,359 --> 00:45:44,339
stranger asked for how forgetful of you

1053
00:45:44,339 --> 00:45:47,220
okay so we got a better ship what the

1054
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:49,130
fuck

1055
00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:51,869
wow that's a nice shovel that's a

1056
00:45:51,869 --> 00:45:54,450
quality shove right there all right why

1057
00:45:54,450 --> 00:45:56,490
are we making all we need a new

1058
00:45:56,490 --> 00:46:03,950
communicator I guess that makes sense

1059
00:46:03,950 --> 00:46:06,720
you say art in these situations right I

1060
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,130
hate raising my volume but that

1061
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:10,079
malfunctioning body odor removal filter

1062
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:11,069
is making a racket

1063
00:46:11,069 --> 00:46:13,200
I think it's malfunctioning captain

1064
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,900
there's something that we need captain

1065
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:18,950
can you hear me captain

1066
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:22,849
what's tape wait what does that mean

1067
00:46:22,849 --> 00:46:30,150
listen Tom supposed to be back by now Oh

1068
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:31,529
everything in life is just for a little

1069
00:46:31,529 --> 00:46:33,569
while captain always needs to be wary of

1070
00:46:33,569 --> 00:46:35,670
surprises all can be lost in a single

1071
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:40,410
day guys I got a bad feeling I got a bad

1072
00:46:40,410 --> 00:46:42,260
feeling about all this

1073
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:45,320
oh there's Tom you fix the body odor

1074
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:47,120
removal filter by replacing the worn-out

1075
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:49,610
screws with tape the captain no longer

1076
00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:51,740
smells of unwashed astronauts everyone

1077
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:53,390
on board could think clearer without the

1078
00:46:53,390 --> 00:46:55,460
constant din drowning out every thought

1079
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:57,470
Tom returned from his library excursion

1080
00:46:57,470 --> 00:46:59,510
quite exhausted problems from all the

1081
00:46:59,510 --> 00:47:01,460
heavy reading he complains about a

1082
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:04,670
rumbling stum a rumbling tumbly I judge

1083
00:47:04,670 --> 00:47:07,010
his mental state to be a little off tom

1084
00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:09,050
says library is a little boring but

1085
00:47:09,050 --> 00:47:11,600
nevertheless impressive a few automatons

1086
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:13,580
take care of a big data collection while

1087
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:15,320
some citizens visit the building to

1088
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:17,570
browse yeah Tom got a bit lost in the

1089
00:47:17,570 --> 00:47:19,310
dark corridors of the libraries of

1090
00:47:19,310 --> 00:47:20,300
restricted section

1091
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:22,550
he used the lighter to find his way back

1092
00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:25,070
but kept dropping it due to shaky hands

1093
00:47:25,070 --> 00:47:27,830
the light has suffered Oh Tom did learn

1094
00:47:27,830 --> 00:47:29,360
something useful during his trip when he

1095
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:30,680
came back he pointed out a few things

1096
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:31,700
around the shuttle that we could

1097
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:33,710
repurpose for crafting who scattered all

1098
00:47:33,710 --> 00:47:35,840
these cans so far away from Earth weird

1099
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:37,670
anyway Tom picked up some soup on the

1100
00:47:37,670 --> 00:47:39,320
way this trip had the potential to

1101
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:40,730
uncover technologies of the astros

1102
00:47:40,730 --> 00:47:42,380
citizen creators could only dream of

1103
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:44,270
only the human mind wasn't solely

1104
00:47:44,270 --> 00:47:46,070
limited baby it shows you that you can

1105
00:47:46,070 --> 00:47:48,320
still count on his friendship oh that's

1106
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:50,750
good that's nice empty stomach

1107
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:52,670
Communications Ray's intercepted number

1108
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:53,840
transmissions that are referencing a

1109
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:55,490
crash space vessel they might referring

1110
00:47:55,490 --> 00:47:59,090
to our ship captain oh is that good or

1111
00:47:59,090 --> 00:48:02,450
bad that could be bad hungry tired

1112
00:48:02,450 --> 00:48:06,980
vigorous okay well we got some goop

1113
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:08,930
might as well make a sock puppet since

1114
00:48:08,930 --> 00:48:10,760
we're good on soup for now because I

1115
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:12,650
want to have one of those captain crew

1116
00:48:12,650 --> 00:48:14,150
made Dawkins is staring at you and

1117
00:48:14,150 --> 00:48:16,700
smiling it's a little disturbing to be

1118
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:18,290
honest she's been doing it for a while

1119
00:48:18,290 --> 00:48:20,420
she says she only wants to chat and lift

1120
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:22,100
your spirits because you look a little

1121
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:22,730
down

1122
00:48:22,730 --> 00:48:24,440
I believe didi is is trying to be a good

1123
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:26,720
friend but captain you're busy right now

1124
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,940
you doing captain stuff you're the boss

1125
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:30,920
here but I think you should not abandon

1126
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:33,230
your post for some idle chats do you

1127
00:48:33,230 --> 00:48:36,590
wish to mingle with the crew of course I

1128
00:48:36,590 --> 00:48:40,460
do I wouldn't do that try do not do or

1129
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:42,590
do not try everyday must end with one

1130
00:48:42,590 --> 00:48:43,910
clear decision hopefully the right one

1131
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:46,880
that's not reassuring at all go to the

1132
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,490
village there's radioactive hazard I

1133
00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:51,240
guess the gas mask would help that

1134
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:55,680
probably okay let's send let's send Dede

1135
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:59,040
out again but Dedes hungry but I've

1136
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,260
it'll feed didi if she if I say right

1137
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:02,820
now on the way out I'm almost positive

1138
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:05,790
so yes we'll spend some time wait is

1139
00:49:05,790 --> 00:49:07,920
that gonna spend time with Dede then let

1140
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:08,900
me see what that does

1141
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:12,360
no it doesn't okay all right all right

1142
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:15,830
Dede you gonna take over in the gas mask

1143
00:49:15,830 --> 00:49:17,000
mask

1144
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,700
yeah when there is none I'm guessing

1145
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:22,500
that's what that's all about

1146
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:27,420
that sounds right it's all right it's

1147
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:29,640
all right yeah it's pretty good so Dee

1148
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:30,990
Dee's the only one that's hungry but Dee

1149
00:49:30,990 --> 00:49:32,550
Dee is gonna get a can of soup on the

1150
00:49:32,550 --> 00:49:35,460
way out that is good maybe a shovel oh

1151
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:38,580
you might be on to something there but

1152
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:39,990
you gotta be banned for backseat gaming

1153
00:49:39,990 --> 00:49:41,900
sorry okay

1154
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:45,270
alright I think we're good to go I think

1155
00:49:45,270 --> 00:49:48,480
we're good okay you spent most of the

1156
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,100
afternoon with Dee Dee discussing your

1157
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:51,810
favorite cinema flicks and sticking out

1158
00:49:51,810 --> 00:49:53,730
your tongues in my direction how dare

1159
00:49:53,730 --> 00:49:55,110
you I'm writing this down is

1160
00:49:55,110 --> 00:49:57,359
insubordination stop laughing at once

1161
00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:01,380
okay well that that was good so we need

1162
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:05,280
to eat now good everything's good I'm

1163
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,770
detecting the huge energy surge the

1164
00:50:07,770 --> 00:50:10,080
service seismic waves I think there's an

1165
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:11,760
earthquake coming the shuttle is sturdy

1166
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,800
but this ground isn't his soil has a

1167
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:15,390
high potential to liquefy when those

1168
00:50:15,390 --> 00:50:17,190
earthquake hits there's a better patch

1169
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:18,720
of rocky ground just a few yards ahead

1170
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,940
you can use the shuttles thrusters to

1171
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:23,250
scoot onto it but if you overshoot it

1172
00:50:23,250 --> 00:50:24,810
you'll be on even worse ground than you

1173
00:50:24,810 --> 00:50:26,340
are now will you attempt the maneuver

1174
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:28,380
well if we don't try it

1175
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:31,380
we're screwed anyway so I say we go for

1176
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:33,510
it because no matter what we got to try

1177
00:50:33,510 --> 00:50:36,090
something right that's the only thing we

1178
00:50:36,090 --> 00:50:38,640
gotta try something we gotta try and

1179
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:41,460
succeed you use the shuttles thrusters

1180
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:43,350
to scoot on to a better patch of ground

1181
00:50:43,350 --> 00:50:44,940
coming to rest on the edge of a rocky

1182
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:47,490
soil the moment the earthquake hit for a

1183
00:50:47,490 --> 00:50:49,530
few nightmarish seconds the shuttle

1184
00:50:49,530 --> 00:50:53,010
bucked to and fro like baby lifting you

1185
00:50:53,010 --> 00:50:55,770
up and down elevating you descending you

1186
00:50:55,770 --> 00:50:59,210
good good yes he cried out into the moon

1187
00:50:59,210 --> 00:51:02,390
light Oh raising you lowering you the

1188
00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:04,550
whole shuttle undulating with your

1189
00:51:04,550 --> 00:51:07,849
passion over a few nightmares seconds

1190
00:51:07,849 --> 00:51:11,240
good good seconds the shuttle buck to

1191
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:13,930
and fro back and forth like a bad

1192
00:51:13,930 --> 00:51:15,560
atmospheric entry

1193
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:18,710
coughing you left right up down forward

1194
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:22,640
backwards Gord Gord anyway but the

1195
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,800
shaking stopped you opened your eyes and

1196
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,859
the strangest silence followed then you

1197
00:51:27,859 --> 00:51:31,670
laughed okay alright what happens when

1198
00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:33,290
we upgrade this sock puppet I think

1199
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:36,260
that's hilarious but we need more soup

1200
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:39,380
we just gotta keep our soup hi baby

1201
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:42,140
appears to be upset captain in his hands

1202
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:45,080
he holds a tiny toy his beloved Soviet

1203
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:47,570
soccer figurine its head has come off he

1204
00:51:47,570 --> 00:51:49,670
sobs saying that this was the only toy

1205
00:51:49,670 --> 00:51:52,700
he was allowed I know I remember

1206
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:54,140
whenever his parents made him do other

1207
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:55,160
things to people

1208
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:57,859
nasty things lifting things he would

1209
00:51:57,859 --> 00:51:59,839
always imagine he was the soccer and as

1210
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:02,089
the victim was a commie spy now he's

1211
00:52:02,089 --> 00:52:04,099
older he realizes if parents were

1212
00:52:04,099 --> 00:52:06,170
probably the bad guys if I had tear

1213
00:52:06,170 --> 00:52:09,050
ducts eyeshadows in abscissa yes if you

1214
00:52:09,050 --> 00:52:11,150

1215
00:52:11,150 --> 00:52:12,950
never seen anyone else touch it it's his

1216
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:14,839
most precious possession what do you

1217
00:52:14,839 --> 00:52:16,910

1224
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:33,050
thought there'd be no harm in indulging

1225
00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:35,690
baby's Soviet beating fantasies so you

1226
00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:37,190
looked at the Soviet soccer figurine

1227
00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:38,990
with him the two of you huddled up in a

1228
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:40,190
chair for a few hours

1229
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:42,680
lifting and lowering benching and unn

1230
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:45,710
benching discussing in depth what baby

1231
00:52:45,710 --> 00:52:47,869
thought about the earth and old America

1232
00:52:47,869 --> 00:52:49,880
then you fell asleep in his arms and it

1233
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:51,470
was the best rest you've had in recent

1234
00:52:51,470 --> 00:52:55,280
memory in baby's big warm embrace you

1235
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:57,080

cosmos he's big strong lifting on

1237
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:04,550
lifting arms good god he whispered as he

1238
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:05,970
went off to sleep

1239
00:53:05,970 --> 00:53:07,920
beautiful captain I remember that

1240
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,359
transmission we received recently the

1241
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:10,619
one with the coordinates it's back

1242
00:53:10,619 --> 00:53:12,270
whoever sent it must still be waiting

1243
00:53:12,270 --> 00:53:16,050
there ah okay well guess we'll take a

1244
00:53:16,050 --> 00:53:17,970
sock puppet and go out there I guess

1245
00:53:17,970 --> 00:53:21,990
guess we'll upgrade a cow nobody's

1246
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:24,090
hungry good

1247
00:53:24,090 --> 00:53:26,070
I could probably wait one more day after

1248
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:28,740
they're hungry but I like keeping my

1249
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:32,790
guys fed maybe rendezvous you approach

1250
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:34,650
the location held up the sock puppet on

1251
00:53:34,650 --> 00:53:36,630
one hand and exclaimed I come at Bridge

1252
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:38,550
a small metal figure has stepped out

1253
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:39,210
from behind the rock

1254
00:53:39,210 --> 00:53:48,000
her name was she Sheila sh e il a Sheila

1255
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,830
and her disappointed look made it

1256
00:53:49,830 --> 00:53:51,180
obvious she was expecting someone else

1257
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:51,930
entirely

1258
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:54,780

the planet system

1266
00:54:09,030 --> 00:54:11,130
Sheila believes Dumbo's programming is

1267
00:54:11,130 --> 00:54:13,080
not flawed and he cannot return her

1268

you have to leap through a string of

a promised free gift and determined you

1310
00:55:51,270 --> 00:55:52,710
did not when you ask why not the

1311
00:55:52,710 --> 00:55:54,210
pamphlet said you had violated the terms

1312
00:55:54,210 --> 00:55:55,530
of service but refused to explain

1313
00:55:55,530 --> 00:55:57,359
further then it vanished in a cloud of

1314
00:55:57,359 --> 00:56:00,000
annoying paradoxes dearly returned from

1315
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,470
the nearby robot village so the place

1316
00:56:01,470 --> 00:56:03,119
isn't big just a few streets in a few

1317
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:05,190
dozen robotic families at the most all

1318
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:07,380
of them peaceful anyway didi state is a

1319
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:08,369
little fragile

1320
00:56:08,369 --> 00:56:10,289
she's famished and a mental state is

1321
00:56:10,289 --> 00:56:12,599
questionable did he walk through some

1322
00:56:12,599 --> 00:56:15,150
weird bad smelling fumes from machinery

1323
00:56:15,150 --> 00:56:17,130
the mask filters were completely covered

1324
00:56:17,130 --> 00:56:19,799
up by a black greasy film knew didi

1325
00:56:19,799 --> 00:56:21,660
stumbled upon a rock formation shaped

1326
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:23,250
like a banana she took a piece to show

1327
00:56:23,250 --> 00:56:24,599
to you but I took the liberty of

1328
00:56:24,599 --> 00:56:26,279
breaking it down to its base components

1329
00:56:26,279 --> 00:56:27,329
you're welcome

1330
00:56:27,329 --> 00:56:28,950
didi found some small dusty rocks and

1331
00:56:28,950 --> 00:56:30,660
even a few gems behind the robotic

1332
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:32,549
houses the inhabitants of the village

1333
00:56:32,549 --> 00:56:34,500
were kind enough to give didi directions

1334
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:36,779
to the bomb craters and robot statue she

1335
00:56:36,779 --> 00:56:38,160
did not expect them to find one out

1336
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:39,930
there but there was an old sock I was

1337
00:56:39,930 --> 00:56:42,510
making a sock the fact that you could

1338
00:56:42,510 --> 00:56:43,770
find some soup out there will never seem

1339
00:56:43,770 --> 00:56:45,660
to amaze me didi was pleasantly

1340
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:47,309
surprised by this trip the automatons

1341
00:56:47,309 --> 00:56:48,720
might keep their distance little though

1342
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:50,789
they are friendly enough that's good

1343
00:56:50,789 --> 00:56:53,579
news but crafting complete I got stupid

1344
00:56:53,579 --> 00:56:56,760
shit okay whatever captain the sentient

1345
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:58,829
robots who introduced himself as Charles

1346
00:56:58,829 --> 00:57:01,289
d12 is welcoming us to the planet of his

1347
00:57:01,289 --> 00:57:01,859
people

1348
00:57:01,859 --> 00:57:04,049
I was asking us for aid he hurt his arm

1349
00:57:04,049 --> 00:57:06,510
in a fall and requires assistance this

1350
00:57:06,510 --> 00:57:09,480
is some advanced technology captain not

1351
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:11,819
sure we can do much to help poor Charlie

1352
00:57:11,819 --> 00:57:13,500
here well perhaps you could improvise

1353
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:15,779
solution okay

1354
00:57:15,779 --> 00:57:24,050
no puss abductee I got a hiccup again

1355
00:57:24,050 --> 00:57:29,950
[Applause]

1356
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:32,750
wait information from Sheila Oh we're

1357
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:34,040
gonna get more information from Sheila

1358
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:36,380
okay I get it so that wasn't a waste

1359
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:37,820
okay where can we go

1360
00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:40,040
you got the museum again we've got robot

1361
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:42,470
statue that's interesting but we don't

1362
00:57:42,470 --> 00:57:45,560
need more Rock bomb craters uh go back

1363
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:47,750
to the bomb craters I guess all right

1364
00:57:47,750 --> 00:57:49,760
Tom you demand Tom well you're not very

1365
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:52,760
agile let me suffer baby to go out there

1366
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:54,710
maybe it's time for baby some baby

1367
00:57:54,710 --> 00:57:56,630
pulled baby's share our baby you're

1368
00:57:56,630 --> 00:57:58,460
gonna go with armor you're gonna go with

1369
00:57:58,460 --> 00:57:59,540
gas mask

1370
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:02,510
wait craters crater is mean digging

1371
00:58:02,510 --> 00:58:05,210
shovel I don't know why they're already

1372
00:58:05,210 --> 00:58:06,440
holes in the ground we'd only make the

1373
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:07,160
holes bigger

1374
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:08,990
okay whatever it's fine Tom Thompson

1375
00:58:08,990 --> 00:58:12,380
hungry tired I'm gonna give Tom some

1376
00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:16,940
food there you go tom you suck go away

1377
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:19,310

1380
00:58:22,910 --> 00:58:24,920
to lift me some more you fixed up the

1381
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:26,480
wandering robots are truly the

1382
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:28,520
cornerstone of human invention Charlie

1383
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:30,440
he said I could call him Charlie was

1384
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:32,030
properly impressed and offered to repay

1385
00:58:32,030 --> 00:58:33,920
the favor the robot shared with her some

1386
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:36,320
information about local customs the

1387
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:38,000
mechanical diseases of the planets have

1388
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,920
renounced violence and Charlie assures

1389
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:41,540
us that we are welcome and should feel

1390
00:58:41,540 --> 00:58:43,280
safe here as he was leaving he promised

1391
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:44,750
to throw us in a good word for his

1392
00:58:44,750 --> 00:58:47,300
compatriots okay baby left to explore

1393
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:48,710
about two holes in the ground riveting

1394
00:58:48,710 --> 00:58:51,140
babies gonna love that sir something is

1395
00:58:51,140 --> 00:58:53,810
seeping into the shuttle it looks like a

1396
00:58:53,810 --> 00:58:56,450
trickle of iron fillings could it be

1397
00:58:56,450 --> 00:58:59,180
nano machines outside - shut up a tract

1398
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:01,280
of bright vital flowers and clean soil

1399
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:02,990
lead away into the distance the nano

1400
00:59:02,990 --> 00:59:04,850
machines are pouring in and pooling on

1401
00:59:04,850 --> 00:59:06,650
the floor sliding in various directions

1402
00:59:06,650 --> 00:59:08,870
there's a high risk situation captain

1403
00:59:08,870 --> 00:59:14,090
shall I continue letting them in

1404
00:59:14,090 --> 00:59:17,010
wait a tract of bright vital flowers and

1405
00:59:17,010 --> 00:59:18,210
clean soil lead away into the distance

1406
00:59:18,210 --> 00:59:20,490
but that seems like a good thing

1407
00:59:20,490 --> 00:59:23,430
I think this clean soit vital flowers

1408
00:59:23,430 --> 00:59:26,270
clean soil that sounds good to me

1409
00:59:26,270 --> 00:59:29,310
sounds good to me honestly that seems

1410
00:59:29,310 --> 00:59:31,260
like a good thing I don't know what this

1411
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:33,900
wad of tissues is all about but I can

1412
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:36,000
guess yeah that's probably fine vital

1413
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,780
flowers vital flowers and clean dirt I

1414
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:44,070
want that give give me some clean dirt

1415
00:59:44,070 --> 00:59:46,950
and vital flowers that sounds perfectly

1416
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:48,420
wonderful the flood of nanomachines

1417
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:49,950
entering the cabin was becoming a

1418
00:59:49,950 --> 00:59:51,780
torrent but you decided not to stem the

1419
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:54,510
flow and interesting decision sir within

1420
00:59:54,510 --> 00:59:55,830
moments they wrapped themselves around

1421
00:59:55,830 --> 00:59:58,020
your leg like a snake of solids once

1422
00:59:58,020 --> 00:59:59,580
they got a taste of you the nanomachines

1423
00:59:59,580 --> 01:00:01,920
started piling up to create a demon gray

1424
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:04,080
pillar I figure beragon to emerge from

1425
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:06,540
the mass it was your captain a nano

1426
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:08,850
clone complete doppelganger within

1427
01:00:08,850 --> 01:00:10,230
minutes it was complete and started

1428
01:00:10,230 --> 01:00:12,210
attacking you we managed to wrestle the

1429
01:00:12,210 --> 01:00:13,350
pretender out of the shuttle but you

1430
01:00:13,350 --> 01:00:16,080
took a matin oh you're in peak physical

1431
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:21,150
condition captain wait wait a minute is

1432
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:22,420
this the cloth

1433
01:00:22,420 --> 01:00:24,040
[Music]

1434
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:26,980
it's the cool it's a clone on the ship

1435
01:00:26,980 --> 01:00:27,430
with us

1436
01:00:27,430 --> 01:00:29,500
Oh rats you know those scratching sounds

1437
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:30,640
coming out of the ventilation shafts

1438
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:31,330
late at night

1439
01:00:31,330 --> 01:00:33,250
we have rodents captain they must have

1440
01:00:33,250 --> 01:00:34,900
hitched a ride from Earth if the

1441
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:36,550
infestation isn't handled the rats will

1442
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:38,650
eat your food supplies then probably you

1443
01:00:38,650 --> 01:00:41,410
how will you deal with this problem and

1444
01:00:41,410 --> 01:00:47,380
book and book II book to the hand nailed

1445
01:00:47,380 --> 01:00:50,140
it I wonder if I'm a clone about that

1446
01:00:50,140 --> 01:00:52,210
rodent infestation yesterday the result

1447
01:00:52,210 --> 01:00:53,860
of your decision about how to handle it

1448
01:00:53,860 --> 01:00:56,470
were unexpected your research how to

1449
01:00:56,470 --> 01:00:58,240
domesticate alien wildlife in the

1450
01:00:58,240 --> 01:00:59,710
handbook and applied what you learned at

1451
01:00:59,710 --> 01:01:01,900
the earth rats great news captain it

1452
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:02,320
worked

1453
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:04,120
they won't ravenously chew through your

1454
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:06,160
food supplies but you do have to love

1455
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:08,890
them oh that's not so bad

1456
01:01:08,890 --> 01:01:10,060
that's actually pretty good I've got

1457
01:01:10,060 --> 01:01:11,920
nothing left to do I don't have any

1458
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,780
other materials I don't want to recycle

1459
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:16,810
anything anyone hungry hungry hungry we

1460
01:01:16,810 --> 01:01:17,800
all hungry

1461
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:20,530
seeing as humans as slaves to emotions I

1462
01:01:20,530 --> 01:01:22,450
understand Sheila came back to get your

1463
01:01:22,450 --> 01:01:25,420
advice on a romantic request it's a way

1464
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:27,250
to make a different robot love her

1465
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:29,770
unconditionally or is it possible for

1466
01:01:29,770 --> 01:01:31,390
her to get rid of a defective feelings

1467
01:01:31,390 --> 01:01:33,580
module altogether now it is a time to

1468
01:01:33,580 --> 01:01:34,840
reconnect with your basic human

1469
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:36,760
instincts what do you feel is the best

1470
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:38,260
approach to effectively revolving

1471
01:01:38,260 --> 01:01:53,320
Sheila's situation 5.1 you guys show you

1472
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:57,370
muscles you gonna not use your muscles

1473
01:01:57,370 --> 01:02:02,770
you got there mates will lift them up

1474
01:02:02,770 --> 01:02:04,270
you gotta elevate them you gotta put

1475
01:02:04,270 --> 01:02:05,680
them down you gonna lift him up you

1476
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:07,540
gotta lift him down you got lift lift

1477
01:02:07,540 --> 01:02:09,310
lower lift lower you lift them up

1478
01:02:09,310 --> 01:02:11,590
because florrum now together with Sheila

1479
01:02:11,590 --> 01:02:13,120
you decide that the best defense is a

1480
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:14,920
good offense you promised to help her

1481
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:16,450
cause the similar glitch in Dumbo's

1482
01:02:16,450 --> 01:02:18,220
programming perhaps this will allow them

1483
01:02:18,220 --> 01:02:20,320
to reciprocate Sheila's feelings I have

1484
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:21,790
to say captain this isn't the most

1485
01:02:21,790 --> 01:02:23,770
ethical decision especially considering

1486
01:02:23,770 --> 01:02:25,030
that this society already has

1487
01:02:25,030 --> 01:02:26,860
matchmaking rules in place you might

1488
01:02:26,860 --> 01:02:28,150
want to start looking around for spare

1489
01:02:28,150 --> 01:02:30,100
parts and tools that's not what I was

1490
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:33,760
suggesting I'm sure Sheila is going to

1491
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:34,930
need a few things to complete the

1492
01:02:34,930 --> 01:02:37,270
procedure oh I didn't know that's

1493
01:02:37,270 --> 01:02:39,340
that's what you were gonna go for I

1494
01:02:39,340 --> 01:02:42,010
didn't think you were gonna do that I'm

1495
01:02:42,010 --> 01:02:45,040
gonna make a super sock puppet I didn't

1496
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:47,290
know that was the thing there's a robot

1497
01:02:47,290 --> 01:02:49,300
city passing outside yes

1498
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:51,460
starlight cities mobile it floats above

1499
01:02:51,460 --> 01:02:53,050
the planets solar Terminator the

1500
01:02:53,050 --> 01:02:55,630
twilight line where day becomes night

1501
01:02:55,630 --> 01:02:57,310
the city has both the day in the night

1502
01:02:57,310 --> 01:03:00,010
side but is 100% starlight palliative

1503
01:03:00,010 --> 01:03:01,780
their technology is far more advanced

1504
01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:03,400
than the other robot communities we've

1505
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:05,260
seen on this world maybe they could help

1506
01:03:05,260 --> 01:03:06,880
you one of you might be able to catch

1507
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:08,170

back tomorrow so we should be good on

1520
01:04:06,809 --> 01:04:09,900
that one we're making it pretty far so

1521
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:11,759
that's pretty good the floating cities

1522
01:04:11,759 --> 01:04:13,680
slowed down and let DeeDee catch up to

1523
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:13,980
it

1524
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:16,049
the robots gave our oxygen and insisting

1525
01:04:16,049 --> 01:04:18,210
on giving a free stuff oh they were so

1526
01:04:18,210 --> 01:04:20,430
nice there are about sub Starlight city

1527
01:04:20,430 --> 01:04:22,049
worried about you getting hungry on such

1528
01:04:22,049 --> 01:04:24,029
a lifeless rocky world so they give you

1529
01:04:24,029 --> 01:04:26,099
swoop to fill your belly good news

1530
01:04:26,099 --> 01:04:27,539
everyone baby found his way back from

1531
01:04:27,539 --> 01:04:29,849
the treacherous bomb crater field he

1532
01:04:29,849 --> 01:04:31,589
returned exhausted on an empty stomach

1533
01:04:31,589 --> 01:04:33,509
and a bit rattled ready to hear his

1534
01:04:33,509 --> 01:04:35,579
report there's a reason even automatons

1535
01:04:35,579 --> 01:04:37,109
don't want to settle there apart from

1536
01:04:37,109 --> 01:04:39,029
the bad memories there are some toxic

1537
01:04:39,029 --> 01:04:41,099
gases still around the air and pollution

1538
01:04:41,099 --> 01:04:42,930
in the ground the master did his job but

1539
01:04:42,930 --> 01:04:44,759
the filters look pretty used up by now

1540
01:04:44,759 --> 01:04:46,980
baby descended into the abyss and looked

1541
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:48,599
particularly promising and shoveled

1542
01:04:48,599 --> 01:04:51,509
until he uncovered some proper Oh baby

1543
01:04:51,509 --> 01:04:53,250
managed to dissect some of the toxin

1544
01:04:53,250 --> 01:04:55,019
fumes coming from the ground who

1545
01:04:55,019 --> 01:04:56,549
scattered all these cans so far away

1546
01:04:56,549 --> 01:04:58,769
from Earth weird anyway baby came back

1547
01:04:58,769 --> 01:05:00,210
carrying rations good thing the

1548
01:05:00,210 --> 01:05:02,009
civilization moved on from their violent

1549
01:05:02,009 --> 01:05:03,900
ways the bomb craters remain what are

1550
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,400
the few reminders of the turbulent past

1551
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:07,589
not the most engaging experience but it

1552
01:05:07,589 --> 01:05:09,119
was still more fun than slowly dying of

1553
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:10,640
boredom inside the shuttles baby says

1554
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:13,589
alright everyone seems to be so happy oh

1555
01:05:13,589 --> 01:05:16,109
it is troublesome captain but appears

1556
01:05:16,109 --> 01:05:17,789
someone was following our Explorer

1557
01:05:17,789 --> 01:05:20,490
during their expedition oh I don't know

1558
01:05:20,490 --> 01:05:21,180
who that could be

1559
01:05:21,180 --> 01:05:24,750
I have no idea who that could be who who

1560
01:05:24,750 --> 01:05:27,329
who could that be I have no idea that

1561
01:05:27,329 --> 01:05:31,410
there's weird uh captain my weather

1562
01:05:31,410 --> 01:05:33,000
systems that detecting a storm on the

1563
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,220
horizon is moving fast so it will

1564
01:05:35,220 --> 01:05:37,170
hopefully pass by tomorrow but this one

1565
01:05:37,170 --> 01:05:39,930
could get nasty thunder lightning gale

1566
01:05:39,930 --> 01:05:42,089
force winds sharp objects howling at you

1567
01:05:42,089 --> 01:05:43,890
from every which way I'd like to keep

1568
01:05:43,890 --> 01:05:45,299
monitoring the storms movement

1569
01:05:45,299 --> 01:05:46,619
throughout the night but doing so will

1570
01:05:46,619 --> 01:05:48,299
require my sensors to run on battery

1571
01:05:48,299 --> 01:05:50,730
power as it is on advisable to leave the

1572
01:05:50,730 --> 01:05:52,680
main generator reacting through a storm

1573
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:55,589
what do you want to do battery

1574
01:05:55,589 --> 01:05:58,769
well captain you are so resourceful and

1575
01:05:58,769 --> 01:06:01,920
handsome no I have a soulmate baby's

1576
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:03,930
back I'm sorry computer it just can't be

1577
01:06:03,930 --> 01:06:05,039
the same between us

1578
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:09,599
Oh gonna go out into the darkness again

1579
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:12,989
that does look like a demon symbol what

1580
01:06:12,989 --> 01:06:15,390
is this what what hazard is that what

1581
01:06:15,390 --> 01:06:17,969
hazard is that and remember if I take

1582
01:06:17,969 --> 01:06:19,499
your answer I'm gonna have to ban you

1583
01:06:19,499 --> 01:06:22,289
but just what is that Klingons I don't

1584
01:06:22,289 --> 01:06:24,329
think so evil pumpkin hazard died

1585
01:06:24,329 --> 01:06:26,699
doubtful pentagram that seems like

1586
01:06:26,699 --> 01:06:27,569
that's what it is

1587
01:06:27,569 --> 01:06:31,680
odd the artifact wait yeah wait do you

1588
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:33,509
send the artifact I thought that myself

1589
01:06:33,509 --> 01:06:35,459
I think I think you would need to bring

1590
01:06:35,459 --> 01:06:36,959
the artifact wouldn't you that makes

1591
01:06:36,959 --> 01:06:39,269
sense to me no no and ban from now and I

1592
01:06:39,269 --> 01:06:41,849
I got to there myself so that was all me

1593
01:06:41,849 --> 01:06:44,009
okay well it says there's a chance for a

1594
01:06:44,009 --> 01:06:46,799
gun there but the same time I'm kind of

1595
01:06:46,799 --> 01:06:49,259
like maybe I should bring a gun just in

1596
01:06:49,259 --> 01:06:51,689
case maybe you should bring the book I'm

1597
01:06:51,689 --> 01:06:53,519
gonna go cow book I'm gonna go cow book

1598
01:06:53,519 --> 01:06:55,650
I'm a cow book we're gonna do cow book

1599
01:06:55,650 --> 01:06:58,140
wait rich if it is a ritual it could be

1600
01:06:58,140 --> 01:06:58,709
dangerous

1601
01:06:58,709 --> 01:07:01,650
I'm gonna give her some armor just in

1602
01:07:01,650 --> 01:07:03,689
case okay and by hungry no hungry no

1603
01:07:03,689 --> 01:07:06,390
hunger I'm not hung go cuz I'm a machine

1604
01:07:06,390 --> 01:07:08,789
you ran the weather monitoring systems

1605
01:07:08,789 --> 01:07:10,619
on battery power the storm moves south

1606
01:07:10,619 --> 01:07:12,479
and you were spared the worst of it by

1607
01:07:12,479 --> 01:07:14,939
morning you'd completely passed oh don't

1608
01:07:14,939 --> 01:07:16,439
you love the smell after her terrains

1609
01:07:16,439 --> 01:07:18,089
you spend the morning sifting through

1610
01:07:18,089 --> 01:07:20,039
the washed up junk piles but it was just

1611
01:07:20,039 --> 01:07:22,380
a bunch of water logs crap dude he went

1612
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:23,910
off to pay a visit to the rowboat tofu's

1613
01:07:23,910 --> 01:07:26,189
first and only Museum while you worry

1614
01:07:26,189 --> 01:07:27,719
about a safe return I will make some

1615
01:07:27,719 --> 01:07:28,859
space on my hard drive for new

1616
01:07:28,859 --> 01:07:30,719
information about this mysterious planet

1617
01:07:30,719 --> 01:07:34,069
okay what are you deleting to do that

1618
01:07:34,069 --> 01:07:36,839

01:07:36,839 --> 01:07:38,309
not hungry you're hungry you're hungry

1620
01:07:38,309 --> 01:07:41,369
okay captain we have unwanted visitors a

1621
01:07:41,369 --> 01:07:43,469
horde of robotic penguins after the

1622
01:07:43,469 --> 01:07:45,539
shadow completely surrounded they appear

1623
01:07:45,539 --> 01:07:47,309
hostile unless they're brandishing those

1624
01:07:47,309 --> 01:07:49,019
knives for some other reason their lawn

1625
01:07:49,019 --> 01:07:51,209
penguins captain the kind of cheap

1626
01:07:51,209 --> 01:07:53,249
decoration of wealthy robot would put in

1627
01:07:53,249 --> 01:07:55,380
his front garden the computers have all

1628
01:07:55,380 --> 01:07:57,959
been hacked by a murderous virus how

1629
01:07:57,959 --> 01:08:00,449
will you deal with them gone oh we just

1630
01:08:00,449 --> 01:08:03,020
got rid of the artifact

1631
01:08:03,020 --> 01:08:07,220
Oh God the second-best option we shall

1632
01:08:07,220 --> 01:08:11,090
use gun on them we're gonna gun them

1633

1637
01:08:26,390 --> 01:08:27,680
and crouched with the gun in your hand

1638
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:29,089
praying it would be enough to stop the

1639
01:08:29,089 --> 01:08:31,160
hold of murderers yard penguins or at

1640
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:32,660
least let you take some of them with you

1641
01:08:32,660 --> 01:08:34,339
but after a few hours you're not sick of

1642
01:08:34,339 --> 01:08:36,440
waiting and opened the door the penguin

1643
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:38,420
were gone there was only an obscene

1644
01:08:38,420 --> 01:08:40,250
shaped carving in the dirt in front of

1645
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:43,160
the shovel Wow real mature guys I bet if

1646
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:44,569
I had the artifact that would have been

1647
01:08:44,569 --> 01:08:47,060
very different but we got soup so that's

1648
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:50,150
good you hungry you hungry no hungee

1649
01:08:50,150 --> 01:08:52,460
alright make more soup we're receiving a

1650
01:08:52,460 --> 01:08:54,140
signal from deep space it seems to be a

1651
01:08:54,140 --> 01:08:56,390
pulsar except it's pulse isn't like

1652
01:08:56,390 --> 01:08:58,370
anything we have seen before pulsars are

1653
01:08:58,370 --> 01:09:00,620
neutron stars we all know what Paul SARS

1654
01:09:00,620 --> 01:09:03,290
are they met beams of e/m radiation that

1655
01:09:03,290 --> 01:09:04,910
can appear to be intelligent in orders

1656
01:09:04,910 --> 01:09:07,160
but this one is the intelligent in

1657
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:09,049
origin do you want to decode the message

1658
01:09:09,049 --> 01:09:12,529
for your VR do your hungee hungee

1659
01:09:12,529 --> 01:09:15,710
okay you are ghee alright go you rush to

1660
01:09:15,710 --> 01:09:17,779
decode the pulsars message it was an

1661
01:09:17,779 --> 01:09:20,270
advertisement domains a Zacks porn

1662
01:09:20,270 --> 01:09:23,779
Emporium voted best in universe freak

1663
01:09:23,779 --> 01:09:25,910
gun giveaway still going on

1664
01:09:25,910 --> 01:09:29,510
turn left off the super strength 462

1665
01:09:29,510 --> 01:09:32,000
parsecs muting this at my league to

1666
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:32,630
death

1667
01:09:32,630 --> 01:09:35,299
you waited but no guns appeared anywhere

1668
01:09:35,299 --> 01:09:37,549
what a lame giveaway Sheela the troubled

1669
01:09:37,549 --> 01:09:39,319
robot is currently trying to gather some

1670
01:09:39,319 --> 01:09:41,120
mechanical parts and tools to help her

1671
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:43,190
create a malfunction in fellow robot

1672
01:09:43,190 --> 01:09:45,710
Dumbo she's hoping to awaken love within

1673
01:09:45,710 --> 01:09:47,810
Dumbo's programming similar to her own

1674
01:09:47,810 --> 01:09:51,440
hold off on gun um cuz it's already gone

1675
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:53,120
bad and we're gonna wait on that one

1676
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:54,830
just a little bit longer we're gonna

1677
01:09:54,830 --> 01:09:56,870
wait and we're gonna get the artifact

1678
01:09:56,870 --> 01:10:01,010
back we're not gonna gun just go over to

1679
01:10:01,010 --> 01:10:04,550
the guy like you better love me or I

1680
01:10:04,550 --> 01:10:07,310
swear because it allowed me to loop back

1681
01:10:07,310 --> 01:10:08,930
before whoa

1682
01:10:08,930 --> 01:10:12,110
Tom are you okay you are looking sassy

1683
01:10:12,110 --> 01:10:14,270
everybody's looking so good everybody

1684
01:10:14,270 --> 01:10:16,760
good everybody's good vigorous alerts oh

1685
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:19,430
I like it alert and vigorous you refuse

1686
01:10:19,430 --> 01:10:21,050
to participate in this scenario any

1687
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:24,740
further captain oh wait no no wait no

1688
01:10:24,740 --> 01:10:29,930
wait wait what no wait no wait no what

1689
01:10:29,930 --> 01:10:34,880
God I still think it's marginally better

1690
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:38,210
than Gunn no but at the same time I wish

1691
01:10:38,210 --> 01:10:41,420
I could have seen it through that was

1692
01:10:41,420 --> 01:10:52,220
real mother real pissed about that one

1693
01:10:52,220 --> 01:10:54,950
okay Tom wants to get matching tattoos

1694
01:10:54,950 --> 01:10:56,450
is a symbol of taking your relationship

1695
01:10:56,450 --> 01:11:01,550
to the next level oh okay according to

1696
01:11:01,550 --> 01:11:03,170
Tom's stories about being a gold

1697
01:11:03,170 --> 01:11:05,360
medalist Olympic bobsledder this was

1698
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:07,160
commonly done before bobsledding teams

1699
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:09,830
before the big race however there will

1700
01:11:09,830 --> 01:11:11,480
be nowhere you can hide this from baby

1701
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:12,740
should you accept it you'll have to

1702
01:11:12,740 --> 01:11:14,480
choose one person or the other will it

1703
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:16,550
be well there's the obvious baby the

1704
01:11:16,550 --> 01:11:18,890
first wrong with you Tom Thomson didi

1705
01:11:18,890 --> 01:11:22,340
we'll be back in a second Jesus Tom get

1706
01:11:22,340 --> 01:11:23,030
over yourself

1707
01:11:23,030 --> 01:11:25,700
me and baby were soul mates soul mates

1708
01:11:25,700 --> 01:11:28,010
Tom you declined to get matching tattoos

1709
01:11:28,010 --> 01:11:30,290
with Tom and chose baby to be a partner

1710
01:11:30,290 --> 01:11:32,930
instead Tom grab the homemade tattoo gun

1711
01:11:32,930 --> 01:11:34,010
and pointed it at you

1712
01:11:34,010 --> 01:11:35,870
you reminded him that wasn't now tattoo

1713
01:11:35,870 --> 01:11:37,760
guns worked and the standoff ended in

1714
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:40,160
tears I observed that a human can still

1715
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:42,770
cry with both eyes open even after

1716
01:11:42,770 --> 01:11:44,930
losing one captain didi returned from

1717
01:11:44,930 --> 01:11:45,650
expedition

1718
01:11:45,650 --> 01:11:47,450
she should have exhausted starved and

1719
01:11:47,450 --> 01:11:49,250
quite stressed out her visit to the

1720
01:11:49,250 --> 01:11:51,110
museum was rather educational did you

1721
01:11:51,110 --> 01:11:53,060
know these automatons programming has

1722
01:11:53,060 --> 01:11:55,280
been set to 0% violence for the past few

1723
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:57,800
centuries a spooky exhibits scare didi

1724
01:11:57,800 --> 01:12:00,200
so much she ran away waving the artifact

1725
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:02,360
around in panic the little statue was

1726
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:04,160
badly damaged did he scored some

1727
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:05,770
resources the trip was definitely

1728
01:12:05,770 --> 01:12:07,670
educational it's clear the history of

1729
01:12:07,670 --> 01:12:09,260
the life on this planet organic or

1730
01:12:09,260 --> 01:12:10,670
otherwise reaches back further than

1731
01:12:10,670 --> 01:12:12,230
human history I found it especially

1732
01:12:12,230 --> 01:12:13,550
interesting that these atomic tones

1733
01:12:13,550 --> 01:12:14,900
build mechanical fauna to keep

1734
01:12:14,900 --> 01:12:19,280
themselves company okay I mean Thomas oh

1735
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:25,820
shit oh shit dude oh he looks oh he

1736
01:12:25,820 --> 01:12:27,320
looks mad

1737
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:29,090
it said that artifact was damaged but it

1738
01:12:29,090 --> 01:12:30,590
doesn't look damaged at all well

1739
01:12:30,590 --> 01:12:32,329
whatever I guess I can't complain we got

1740
01:12:32,329 --> 01:12:35,270
so much Rock why do we have so much rock

1741
01:12:35,270 --> 01:12:37,070
we don't have anything else to make we

1742
01:12:37,070 --> 01:12:39,170
just got Rock no well now Tom's in

1743
01:12:39,170 --> 01:12:45,139
supporting whatever Tom shut up shut up

1744
01:12:45,139 --> 01:12:47,360
Tom my metal detector is showing a piece

1745
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:49,489
of ancient robot technology buried a few

1746
01:12:49,489 --> 01:12:51,260
paces from the shuttle I don't know if

1747
01:12:51,260 --> 01:12:53,020
it's possible but it's a coffeemaker

1748
01:12:53,020 --> 01:12:55,699
fancy one do robots even drink coffee

1749
01:12:55,699 --> 01:12:57,530
really way the coffeemaker isn't buried

1750
01:12:57,530 --> 01:12:58,760
too deep you could probably get in with

1751
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:00,170
your bare hands still seems to be

1752
01:13:00,170 --> 01:13:01,909
functioning you want to dig it up sure

1753
01:13:01,909 --> 01:13:04,489
haunted coffee maker I'll take it who's

1754
01:13:04,489 --> 01:13:04,989
hungry

1755
01:13:04,989 --> 01:13:08,270
who's hungry we're all hungry Hey time

1756
01:13:08,270 --> 01:13:09,920
for a family meal everybody food all

1757
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:11,449
round and we're gonna have coffee

1758
01:13:11,449 --> 01:13:14,150
is there even a better way to live life

1759
01:13:14,150 --> 01:13:15,889
you know what Tom shouldn't have asked

1760
01:13:15,889 --> 01:13:19,670
Tom knew I was spoken for oh he's better

1761
01:13:19,670 --> 01:13:21,800
now he's better you and the other crew

1762
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:23,810
members dug up with fancy coffeemaker

1763
01:13:23,810 --> 01:13:25,219
and discovered it was still full of

1764
01:13:25,219 --> 01:13:27,050
beans genetically engineered to meet

1765
01:13:27,050 --> 01:13:29,630
robot tastes meaning the longest lasting

1766
01:13:29,630 --> 01:13:32,270
and best-tasting in the universe they

1767
01:13:32,270 --> 01:13:34,159
were still good you sat and shared the

1768
01:13:34,159 --> 01:13:36,550
most amazing cup of coffee of your lives

1769
01:13:36,550 --> 01:13:39,020
philosophizing for hours about how the

1770
01:13:39,020 --> 01:13:40,520
robots were able to provoke this once

1771
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:42,800
exclusive human art form I've never seen

1772
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:44,360
a human more excited than dee dee was

1773
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:45,770
when she drank that delicious coffee

1774
01:13:45,770 --> 01:13:47,599
she's much happier since she received

1775
01:13:47,599 --> 01:13:49,400
that unexpected dose of caffeine

1776
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:51,380
she kept sniffing the mug for hours

1777
01:13:51,380 --> 01:13:53,300
until the smell finally went away well

1778
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:55,730
he's no longer insubordinate that's fun

1779
01:13:55,730 --> 01:13:57,949
now everyone's happy I am a machine and

1780
01:13:57,949 --> 01:13:59,900
machines cannot hear voices the voices

1781
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:01,820
that I'm not hearing right now are

1782
01:14:01,820 --> 01:14:03,739
getting very loud though oh you hear

1783
01:14:03,739 --> 01:14:05,389
them too my weight sensors are picking

1784
01:14:05,389 --> 01:14:07,489
something up as well a two-dimensional

1785
01:14:07,489 --> 01:14:09,949
species that explains why my cameras

1786
01:14:09,949 --> 01:14:12,260
missed them quite vicious I gather with

1787
01:14:12,260 --> 01:14:14,389
one decisive yell the voices are

1788
01:14:14,389 --> 01:14:16,429
approaching fast here inside the doors

1789
01:14:16,429 --> 01:14:18,530
look very empty yet very hostile all of

1790
01:14:18,530 --> 01:14:20,630
a sudden how will you defend us captain

1791
01:14:20,630 --> 01:14:26,270

1851
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:58,349
recorded a transmission this morning it

1852
01:16:58,349 --> 01:16:59,789
was a public service announcement from

1853

behind his quarters permanently

1858
01:17:08,940 --> 01:17:10,980
deactivated as I understand it was an

1859
01:17:10,980 --> 01:17:13,170
accidental deactivation looks like

1860
01:17:13,170 --> 01:17:14,519
someone unqualified was trying to

1861
01:17:14,519 --> 01:17:16,019
perform a complicated procedure on the

1862
01:17:16,019 --> 01:17:17,730

how tragic

1864
01:17:19,349 --> 01:17:21,239
