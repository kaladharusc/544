1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:10,440
I don't have time very sure but

2
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,599
genetically engineered to stop aging at

3
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:15,420
25 but why does this movie ever explain

4
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,580
why how this came to be no no it does

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,310
not just deal with it time is now the

6
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:22,289
currency will be chooses an expositional

7
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:23,820
monologue that reveals a central conceit

8
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,109
of the movie instead of showing it to us

9
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:26,430
in a much more interesting way without

10
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,529
context I just want to wake up with more

11
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:31,019
time on my hand and hours in the day but

12
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:32,940
if you were down to around 24 hours why

13
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,860
would you even sleep you've got a date

14
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,420
Olivia get out there and hustle some

15
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:36,989
more hours

16
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:38,309
how much hardware is required to make

17
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:40,170
this on the skin displayable even work

18
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,850
this is like three surgeries worth of

19
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,379
bullshit right you can't do this with

20
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:45,960
genetic modification happy fiftieth yep

21
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,670
that's his mom even though the actor

22
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:48,960
Timberlake is a few years older than

23
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,100
Olivia a while this movie's

24
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,690
understanding of time allows for them to

25
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:53,340
appear to be the same age thanks not

26
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,890
philip k dick 25 for the 25th time

27
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,660
actually if she's 50 years old she'd be

28
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,000
25 for the 26th time but Justin wasn't

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,350
told there would be math involved in

30
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,000
this movie heavily reliant on Matt I was

31
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,890
sure I'd have a grandchild by now so

32
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,080
will is 28 years old perfect baby-making

33
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,790
age but since everyone's bodies remain

34
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:10,710
physically 25 does that mean everyone

35
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,900
can procreate into their hundreds I can

36
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,479
make extra on the side you know fighting

37
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:17,460
nobody wins in that case the book you

38
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,229
should be pretty upset I just wouldn't

39
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:21,479
know what to do if I lost it reverse for

40
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:22,140
shot irony

41
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,580
so shaking hands with someone in this

42
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,229
universe results in time changing hands

43
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:26,369
it's not like they have timers or

44
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:27,659
controllers in this scene they just

45
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:29,460
clasp hands and then watch the clocks on

46
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,110
their wrists I mean how many times have

47
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:32,340
folks in this world given up their time

48
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,570
on accident just because they touched

49
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:35,220
someone else the wrong wait I'm give you

50
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,509
30 minutes you can have a decent lunch

51
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:38,340
how does the arm timer know when to stop

52
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,930
is it controlled by the brain but

53
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:41,759
stopped at 30 minutes donated flat how

54
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,470
did it do that I'd be goddamned it this

55
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,060
movie explains anything the name of this

56
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,890
beer is a nice time-related pun but it

57
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:48,869
costs an hour earlier Will's mom gave

58
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:50,460
him 30 minutes for a decent meal but a

59
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,869
fucking six-pack will set an average

60
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:54,659
person back 4% of their lifespan another

61
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:57,149
one broad daylight and his corpse is

62
00:01:57,149 --> 00:01:58,170
just hanging out in the middle of the

63
00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:59,520
workforce does this movie need Sally

64
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,170
Field to step in and organize a union in

65
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:02,340
the future money will be replaced by

66
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,229
time genetic modification is rampant and

67
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:06,119
yet factories will still somehow need to

68
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:08,039
employ humans to operate a lever I think

69
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,390
the scariest part of this future is that

70
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:11,460
we'll be wearing a button suits

71
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:14,910
anything stupid go I'm only going to

72
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,380
obviously stand here and watch some guys

73
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,880
kill another guy from 20 feet away

74
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,280
that's not stupid right and this is a

75
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,530
very nice watch this statement brings up

76
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:23,820
an interesting point why don't more

77
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,350
people have watches in this movie sure

78
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:26,790
they have time printed on their arm but

79
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,230
that's only the time they have left what

80
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,280
if they have a doctor's appointment or

81
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,930
want to catch a movie um is anyone gonna

82
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:32,250
notice the obvious Timberlake buy a

83
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,200
stander in the background no okay

84
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,120
at the moment not only does Henry

85
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,950
ludicrously ask for a moment to puke

86
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,660
before he dies these assholes give it to

87
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:44,340
him ready to go wait will was standing

88
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,990
in the stall this whole time he couldn't

89
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:47,190
have come in after Henry since The Goon

90
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:49,470
followed him so he had to know Henry was

91
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,030
gonna do some pre death vomiting Jesus

92
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,470
this movie has already broadcast that

93
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,820
it's brain wasn't a line item in the

94
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,260
budget this dumpster that was easily

95
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,090
movable by will is somehow able to hold

96
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,710
off many strong men from opening the

97
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:01,050
door I know who took him I know who he

98
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,390
is also how the does discount Ryan

99
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:05,490
Filipino who will is he didn't have one

100
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:06,810
look at his face when he got knocked out

101
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,340
in the bathroom he saved till morning

102
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,930
I'll get you out of here yeah I'm sure

103
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:11,430
those large men with guns are just gonna

104
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,570
forget all about this incident even

105
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:14,130
though at least one of them is literally

106
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:15,420
outside the front door and I'm standing

107
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:18,000
in plain sight 105 but the day comes

108
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,890
when you've had enough your mind can be

109
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:22,230
spent even if your body's not sure but

110
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,940
Henry's whole suicide by drunken fight

111
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,530
with gangsters plan ensures those

112
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:26,970
fuckers get his time instead of donating

113
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:28,230
it the people who could really use it

114
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,700
why do you think there are time zones

115
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,950
because the earth is gigantic the truth

116
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:34,200
is there's more than enough no one has

117
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,970
to die before their time but what is

118
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:37,710
everyone's time movie yada yada spaz

119
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,690
sickness murderer accidents and any

120
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,010
other cause of death besides running out

121
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:42,930
of King time this plot would be perfect

122
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,430
for a Twilight Zone episode but instead

123
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,870
is stretched out to a whole movie I'm

124
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,430
honestly surprised those assholes with

125
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,780
guns who were directly outside this

126
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:49,950
building last night decided not to

127
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:51,510
inspect it first off this is some pretty

128
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:53,310
goddamn non-consensual time swapping

129
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,450
here don't you have to have a willing

130
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:55,740
participant before you go sticking your

131
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,630
minutes inside someone also earlier it

132
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,010
took wills mom a decent chunk of time to

133
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:00,720
transfer thirty minutes to him but Henry

134
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,370
transfers more than a fucking century in

135
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,500
less than 18 seconds even goddamn

136
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,210
newborns have the green timers did they

137
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:07,740
somehow make this green clock bullshit

138
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,600
part of the common genetic code the fuck

139
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,900
look at this where did you get that

140
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,370
even though he saw the dude last night

141
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:16,109
that had all the time Burrell must think

142
00:04:16,109 --> 00:04:17,549
there's a possibility we'll ran into

143
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:18,989
another person that might have gifted

144
00:04:18,989 --> 00:04:20,930
him some sweet future currency

145
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:22,789
okay after being treated for having too

146
00:04:22,789 --> 00:04:24,139
much obvious time which will get him

147
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:25,789
killed in the zone will gives Burrell a

148
00:04:25,789 --> 00:04:27,500
bunch of obvious time in the hopes it

149
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,650
won't get him killed in this zone

150
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:34,430
received two hours to walk goddamnit

151
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:36,050
movie mamas Alice just looked all happy

152
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:37,400
about making her loan payment that was

153
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,289
two fucking days but she only left

154
00:04:39,289 --> 00:04:40,639
herself an hour and a half and after

155
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:41,990
paying what she thought was the one hour

156
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,520
bus fare she'd have thirty fifteen

157
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,410
minutes if it's a two-hour can walk the

158
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,000
bus ride must take at least thirty

159
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,889
minutes especially with stops mother the

160
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:50,660
stupid movie takes an awesome premise

161
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,160
and pisses all over it let's just be

162
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,419
honest we've all had a dream where

163
00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:55,400
Olivia Wilde was our mother right oh you

164
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,009
imagined her as your oh god that's nasty

165
00:04:58,009 --> 00:04:59,240
what's wrong with you

166
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,860
oh they're both running well then I

167
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,090
guess she's gonna die within sight of

168
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:03,889
him a mom dies because she stupidly

169
00:05:03,889 --> 00:05:05,330
spent all our time on a loan payment and

170
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:06,500
didn't have enough to make it to meet

171
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,789
her son who is suddenly flush with

172
00:05:07,789 --> 00:05:11,930
currency cliche I'm sorry but

173
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:13,520
Timberlake's crying over his mom's death

174
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,620
here is pretty hilarious and you thought

175
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,030
the crying Jordan mean was over-the-top

176
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,259
how long you been keeping time Jaeger

177
00:05:18,259 --> 00:05:20,030
five years let me know what you're

178
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:21,830
thinking you've been doing it for 50 Wow

179
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,780
sick burn detective but if this guy has

180
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:24,860
been on the force for five years

181
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,210
shouldn't he already be aware how long

182
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:27,770
you've been doing this what would you

183
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:29,510
like us to do sir what we always do all

184
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:31,580
the time you know kind of like Prince

185
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,020
and the revolution did in purple ring

186
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,820
I'll give you ten minutes for an hour

187
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,770
this is the most confusing proposition

188
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,599
of all time we don't normally make

189
00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:39,560
pickups in this zone

190
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,539
so how the fuck did will get the contact

191
00:05:41,539 --> 00:05:42,979
information for this transport service

192
00:05:42,979 --> 00:05:44,720
and why didn't anyone in Dayton notice

193
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,190
this nice ass car where and when did

194
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,510
we'll get this fancy ass looking suit

195
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,800
did he bury his mother already why is

196
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,599
this movie so dumb and he's blowing past

197
00:05:50,599 --> 00:05:51,830
all the other time zones he's never

198
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,389
experienced missing out on the famous

199
00:05:53,389 --> 00:05:54,740
sights and pleasures each might have to

200
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,300
offer above the only zone he's ever

201
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,669
known the outermost super pores oh sure

202
00:05:58,669 --> 00:06:00,050
he's obviously got some kind of goal but

203
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,849
all I'm saying is he's acting like only

204
00:06:01,849 --> 00:06:03,740
the very richest most exclusive time

205
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,060
zone has anything interesting to offer

206
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,370
which can't possibly be true I'm gonna

207
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:09,169
take them for everything they've got at

208
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:10,099
escalated quickly

209
00:06:10,099 --> 00:06:11,840
he went from my mom just died to the

210
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,000
entire system up in like a day also

211
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,770
driver continues to casually drive after

212
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,150
hearing an obvious threat to his way of

213
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:19,190
life supposedly utopian new Greenwich

214
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:21,199
looks a lot more like suburban Galveston

215
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,840
totally by happenstance JT shows up here

216
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,759
just as the redheaded wig girls arriving

217
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,590
and longing for someone to stare at also

218
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:28,159
JT

219
00:06:28,159 --> 00:06:30,409
Olivia Wilde and Amanda ciphered this is

220
00:06:30,409 --> 00:06:31,909
like a Shawn at uh C or Dominique Swain

221
00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:33,380
appearance away from being a full-bore

222
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,669
alpha dog reunion

223
00:06:34,669 --> 00:06:36,830
it's fast it's gonna have to be but they

224
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,389
must have just seen Henry dial-up

225
00:06:38,389 --> 00:06:40,310
without will even touching it so why do

226
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,870
they immediately think he's the one that

227
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,490
took his time that'll be eight and a

228
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:44,029
half weeks

229
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:45,979
dang one week shy of a mickey rourke

230
00:06:45,979 --> 00:06:47,900
movie also let's break this down a

231
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,300
standard room is two months or sixty

232
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:50,719
days

233
00:06:50,719 --> 00:06:52,639
breakfast is eight and a half weeks or

234
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,310
basically sixty days a room here and

235
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,560
breakfast here cost the exact same think

236
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,879
about that the society is either

237
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:00,529
devaluing hotel rooms or way over

238
00:07:00,529 --> 00:07:02,719
valuing eggs I probably don't have to

239
00:07:02,719 --> 00:07:04,430
tell you this about JT but as long as

240
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,749
he's got that suit in time he's gonna

241
00:07:05,749 --> 00:07:07,159
leave it all on the floor tonight so

242
00:07:07,159 --> 00:07:08,870
he's got a hundred years told the limo

243
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,250
driver he's here to fuck the entire

244
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,199
system and he goes gambling how much

245
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:13,550
high-stakes poker did he play back in

246
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:15,050
the slums to be this fucking confident

247
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,759
also good to know that in the dystopian

248
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:18,590
future people will not only still be

249
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:20,300
playing Texas Hold'em but it'll still be

250
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,490
a fucking sausage fest wait is this shot

251
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:25,759
telling me he now has 250 years he's 150

252
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,529
years at poker already and no one

253
00:07:27,529 --> 00:07:28,849
thought to discuss who he was or where

254
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:30,919
he came from until now so if she's not

255
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:32,569
outside the hotel right when JT arrives

256
00:07:32,569 --> 00:07:34,279
to get infatuated with him none of the

257
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:35,810
rest of the movie is even possible just

258
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:37,699
FYI always been survival of the fittest

259
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:39,680
raise you another two centuries

260
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,719
literally down to his last 27 seconds

261
00:07:41,719 --> 00:07:43,639
what a stupid fucking bet not to mention

262
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:45,529
if that small talk about survival of the

263
00:07:45,529 --> 00:07:47,180
fittest had gone on even 30 seconds

264
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,860
longer this bet might not even have gone

265
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:51,690
through but mostly what a stupid can bet

266
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:54,520
[Music]

267
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,469
and Silvia quietly climaxes under the

268
00:07:57,469 --> 00:08:00,379
table also yeah he wins what the ever I

269
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:01,789
don't think this movie pokers any better

270
00:08:01,789 --> 00:08:04,009
than it futures that was some risk that

271
00:08:04,009 --> 00:08:07,080
was some understatement

272
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,640
drive it man wills plan to take down the

273
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,080
cultural elite to avenge his mom's death

274
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,030
by gambling and buying expensive cars is

275
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:15,310
going perfectly and my daughter Sylvia I

276
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,420
believe you two have already met

277
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,550
Philippe says this slyly like he didn't

278
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:20,140
introduce them to each other two movie

279
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:20,770
minutes ago

280
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,510
and we have yet another example of the

281
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:24,190
screenwriters cramming unnecessary James

282
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,690
Bond tea and cliches into the script

283
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:27,100
okay will is smart enough to know that

284
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,420
Philippe is not to be trusted

285
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,860
so therefore dancing with Philippe's

286
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,480
daughter is dangerous but apparently the

287
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,830
allure of the redhead is too much for

288
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:34,180
will these two are able to run away from

289
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,590
the party with on a single escort

290
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:37,810
bodyguard or even a curious voyeur we

291
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:39,760
don't go in how did you evolve to be

292
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,229
afraid of the ocean or is it somehow

293
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,120
poison but instead of saying it's poison

294
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,710
do you say you're insane

295
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:46,060
they're time-codes be glowing while

296
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,980
we'll soundless be growing and yes those

297
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,510
time codes would be emitting light and

298
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,100
all but they've never been shown to be

299
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,540
this bright it's like we needed a way to

300
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,800
show the leads faces while they're

301
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,240
skinny-dipping in the grotto section of

302
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,860
the ocean they both got dried off and

303
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,060
back into their clothes and basically

304
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,350
record time for this scene to be

305
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:01,240
possible how about that candidate Jesus

306
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,650
who's the actual antagonist in this

307
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:04,780
movie Papa Weiss the detective new

308
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,730
Greenwich the gangsters in Dayton time

309
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:08,740
itself andrew niccol these cops bust in

310
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,240
and grab will for questioning and then

311
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,010
take him upstairs in the house the party

312
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,620
is going on in while Willy gets

313
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,970
questioned in an 18th century French

314
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:17,950
parlor I'm left to ask about the guards

315
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:19,780
guns what are they for can you shoot

316
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,100
someone who still has tons of time on

317
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,540
their wrists and if you do what happens

318
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,670
to that time and also who thought C

319
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:25,870
green and gold was a good combination

320
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:27,550
for this room I can only assume wills

321
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,230
plan to up in society is going a

322
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:30,760
schedule and that he intended to get all

323
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,510
his time taken and himself in prison

324
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,530
this is a gathering of some of the

325
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:37,060
richest people in the world security is

326
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,530
tight and there's a gaggle of policeman

327
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:40,630
to arrest will but only one asshole is

328
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:41,980
out here guarding the parking lot pretty

329
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,720
amazing that you can see LA's I mean new

330
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,130
Greenwich is skyscrapers from the same

331
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:46,870
angle here is in Dayton I gotta ask

332
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,970
coming from the slums has he even driven

333
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:49,360
before

334
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,680
my point is that he shouldn't have an up

335
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,330
driving experience to be this good but

336
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:55,390
yet he does no cop trailing a fleeing

337
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,490
suspect with a hostage would ever RAM

338
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:59,380
the car the hostage is in that's in

339
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,060
laughable movie I know you need action

340
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,470
in tension but try to leave at least a

341
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:04,330
10% connection to reason not only was

342
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:05,920
Leon the only police officer to give

343
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,940
chase from the house he immediately

344
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,500
gives up after getting into a fender

345
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,470
bender he

346
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:12,350
covered anybody cz you're definitely

347
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:15,110
dead but why unless they work back to

348
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:16,430
the ghetto somehow there's still a new

349
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:17,840
Greenwich which should be the safest

350
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,280
place in the world we'll had a little

351
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,510
more than an hour left after they

352
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:21,890
escaped from the house party and it was

353
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:23,180
pitch dark but now it's broad daylight

354
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:27,830
and he's very not dead they both

355
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:28,610
survived this

356
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:30,980
I can't tell is it irony or incompetence

357
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,660
that has these same officers back at the

358
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,220
same LA River for yet another crime

359
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:34,550
scene

360
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,860
I mean it's cyclical right he's back in

361
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:39,410
his own neighborhood looking how even if

362
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:40,760
it doesn't cost any time to get from the

363
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,230
riches owned to the poor zone there were

364
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:44,180
barriers and checkpoints going both ways

365
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,260
on the trip to new Greenwich

366
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,490
look I know they're in the ghetto and

367
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:48,230
everything but wills walking down the

368
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,730
middle of the goddamn street with a gun

369
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:53,960
pointed at Silvia Wow thank God he gave

370
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,990
her a gun am i right his shot was

371
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:58,070
words.you time down but I took my

372
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:59,630
sweet-ass time getting here just in case

373
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:03,050
we don't cute together well maybe that

374
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:04,880
should still be like the 15th furthest

375
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,140
thing from your mind right now after

376
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,630
escape escape escape and 12 more escape

377
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:11,090
thoughts you've forgotten I shot a cop

378
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:12,830
our time keepers really cops I thought

379
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:14,060
they just kept track of time for the

380
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,320
various districts but do they

381
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,000
investigate other non time related

382
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,410
criminal acts like arson

383
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:21,380
you can go back go back to life oh I

384
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,720
don't know security immortality caviar

385
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,520
was that objectionable I don't have a

386
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,090
choice

387
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:27,260
I'm starting to think that I don't

388
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,300
either movie veers jarringly into a

389
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,620
meditation of life in the meaning of

390
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,180
existence and the disparity between

391
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:34,340
classes in a society and I could not

392
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,800
give viewers romance by proximity

393
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,390
there's almost no reason for them to be

394
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:39,950
kissing except the last few hours spent

395
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,750
together and a bit of Stockholm Syndrome

396
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,340
this map informs us that Philippe is on

397
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,480
the phone with the American West Coast

398
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,610
the entirety of Europe most of Central

399
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:48,980
Africa and Moscow which means I guess

400
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,840
the rest of the world is ghettoized what

401
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,740
about white

402
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,150
after being recently shot in the street

403
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:54,800
to the ghetto detective redeye is right

404
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,600
back to evening without any difficulty

405
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,540
this is cog a trigger you don't pull it

406
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,010
until you actually want to shoot

407
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:03,050
something first off these two have hours

408
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:04,370
left but somehow they have time for

409
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:06,500
witty banter and target practice second

410
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,060
she just shot the moving detective that

411
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,440
was about to kill will so I don't think

412
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,180
she needs much direction on firearms I

413
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,490
can hope you get overtime

414
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:14,470
and finally wills take them for all

415
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,880
they're worth plan pays off after

416
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,470
countless instances where he could have

417
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,060
and should have died prior to this this

418
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,860
was the plan to steal an armored truck

419
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,300
and Ram it into a bank that for some

420
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,560
reason has a wide-open vault

421
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,779
okay fine but why did will need Silvia

422
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:27,250
for this caper he couldn't come up with

423
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,380
this on his own why has nobody tried

424
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:31,330
this before if it's a cz come on help

425
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:32,080
yourselves

426
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,450
take it causing a literal riot for your

427
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:35,770
getaway I mean there is no question

428
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:37,600
one-fourth of these people are dead by

429
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,510
the time this bank vault is empty right

430
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:40,750
huh

431
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:41,890
at this point I'm willing to believe

432
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:43,480
Leon is actually a series of clones

433
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,980
considering he's able to get from the

434
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,240
ghetto to new Greenwich and back in

435
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,910
seconds Sylvia Weis withdrew some of her

436
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,709
inheritance when she and will Salas

437
00:12:50,709 --> 00:12:53,140
robbed her father's time bank for the

438
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,540
sixth time in a week looking 6th time

439
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,430
now where the bank's not hip to the hole

440
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:58,810
drive an armored truck through the front

441
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:00,490
door scheme after the first one also

442
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:02,110
shouldn't the timekeepers just be

443
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:03,339
keeping an eye out for the fucking

444
00:13:03,339 --> 00:13:04,810
armored truck that has dents and glass

445
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:06,520
shards all over it why do I play strip

446
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,709
poker with you why did you hide wager

447
00:13:08,709 --> 00:13:10,330
it's because it's been 40 minutes since

448
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:11,740
this movie showed any skin wheels

449
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,029
character was introduced as a fighter

450
00:13:13,029 --> 00:13:14,770
but his biggest attribute thus far has

451
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:16,209
been long-distance running which is

452
00:13:16,209 --> 00:13:17,649
obviously much more entertaining than

453
00:13:17,649 --> 00:13:19,240
seeing him actually fight someone to

454
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,220
look familiar how about now goddamn

455
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,750
everyone in this movie is motivated by

456
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,910
currency over everything else and I'm

457
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:27,399
gonna clean the cross off of every one

458
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:29,910
of you in this hellhole until someone

459
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:33,550
says something I wanna hear gotta be

460
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:35,410
honest no idea who this guy is I know

461
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:36,490
I've seen him a couple times in this

462
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:38,020
movie and he's clearly bad but other

463
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,060
than that I'm lost with a reward like

464
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,980
ten years these two are screwed right I

465
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,570
mean ten years in the ghetto is like a

466
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:47,959
hundred years elsewhere right he catches

467
00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:51,240
there's no way they won't kill us movie

468
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,250
that started off as 1984 then morphed

469
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,050
into Casino Royale then became Robin

470
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:56,459
Hood now wants to be Bonnie and Clyde

471
00:13:56,459 --> 00:13:58,140
well I guess they're in love now then

472
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,870
ain't fortunately for you I don't like

473
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,040
to kill a man in cold blood

474
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,750
I like to give him the plot information

475
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,519
let him escape easily then futile II

476
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:06,510
chase him for a few minutes before

477
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,790
giving up that's my kind of thing after

478
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:11,430
I take you I'll take her all bad guys

479
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:12,470
are rapists

480
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:14,610
these armwrestling fights make no

481
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:16,529
goddamn sense first we've never seen an

482
00:14:16,529 --> 00:14:17,640
actual fight to this point in the movie

483
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,440
so there's no point of reference second

484
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,180
how the fuck does it work is it a battle

485
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,250
of wills of strength of who can pad the

486
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,899
movies runtime the longest listen if all

487
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:26,519
these were just standing around staring

488
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:28,019
at this fight while we'll pulls out a

489
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:29,870
gun they deserve to die

490
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:32,730
stop Sylvia Weis the most wanted woman

491
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:34,680
in every time zone is able to not only

492
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,180
travel from Dayton back to new Greenwich

493
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,100
but can walk the through the front door

494
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,750
of this building you see this is what

495
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,860
happens when you don't properly check

496
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,480
references you mistakenly hire the guy

497
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,620
who kidnapped your daughter at gunpoint

498
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:44,910
and is actively trying to bring down

499
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,860
your international banking scheme wait

500
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,899
last we saw these two they were all the

501
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:50,279
way over in the slums and then they get

502
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:51,959
an idea and what waltz all the way back

503
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:53,339
to new Greenwich without any trouble at

504
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:55,320
any other time zone stops let's go for a

505
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,029
ride and the three of them got away with

506
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:59,130
no one following phew and wire me my per

507
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:02,490
diem wait never mind I have him yes but

508
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:04,440
does Leon really think even in the best

509
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,970
of circumstances that this arrest will

510
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:07,829
take less than 45 minutes and couldn't

511
00:15:07,829 --> 00:15:09,209
he pursue them while he's getting his

512
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:12,029
per diem wait never mind I haven't yeah

513
00:15:12,029 --> 00:15:13,680
that's right kids just happened to drive

514
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,149
past the people I'm looking for in this

515
00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:17,459
huge city because movie if I gave any

516
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:18,810
more because I'd literally be upset

517
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:20,279
they've now set enough to have Dayton

518
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:22,020
directly adjacent to new Greenwich even

519
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,130
though there should be several other

520
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,390
time zones between them is that thing

521
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,430
being bulletproof somehow or did no one

522
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:28,380
shoot at the tires this movie suggests a

523
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,760
crowd of desperate poor people would all

524
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,709
share in the spoils evenly which anyone

525
00:15:31,709 --> 00:15:32,640
who has ever studied American history

526
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,890
can tell you is a first and a half yeah

527
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:37,199
I know it's personal all now but is it

528
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:38,760
Leon's still more concerned about the

529
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,230
system crashing than these two criminals

530
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,180
the million year capsule is right in the

531
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,769
middle of town for God's sake one of us

532
00:15:43,769 --> 00:15:46,890
can make it take my arguing over who

533
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:48,360
should go will almost definitely end up

534
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,130
killing both these fools or at least it

535
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:51,600
should what are the odds that this guy

536
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,130
once again finds himself literally

537
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:55,110
racing toward a female he hopes to save

538
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:57,089
with his time and cutting it too close I

539
00:15:57,089 --> 00:15:58,890
mean yeah parallel narratives or

540
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:00,449
whatever but the odds still make this

541
00:16:00,449 --> 00:16:00,720
scene

542
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,189
kind of stupid right Sylvie has been

543
00:16:02,189 --> 00:16:04,290
running all this away in heels despite

544
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:06,509
being on TV levels of wanted neither of

545
00:16:06,509 --> 00:16:07,529
these fools have changed their

546
00:16:07,529 --> 00:16:16,300
appearance yet

547
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:29,720
[Music]

548
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,450
singing kill my grandma okay

549
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:42,240
dance with me so your idea is to get a

550
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,490
van and cruise the streets looking for

551
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:51,390
kids to pick up yes its Peter Campbell

552

Hastings how come here is like a gas and

554

twice
