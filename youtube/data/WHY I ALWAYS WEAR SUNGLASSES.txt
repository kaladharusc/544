i have a meeting in midtown this morning took the subway

10
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:13,229
I don't like a change of pace today's episode in its entirety is going to be

11
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:15,240
about my sunglasses

12
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:24,990
now I've made an entire movie about the design of my sunglasses and then like a

13
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:29,009
year ago I made an entire blog episode about how to make these sunglasses

14
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,570
you want a sharp knife and you just kind of scrape today I want to really get

15
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:36,720
into like the why I wear sunglasses

16
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,470
plus they do buy a pair these are kind of whoa

17
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:45,119
these are not sunglasses that look crazy

18
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:52,890
don't want it super hero hello this like a heads-up display setup for this little

19
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:57,509
drone that was a gift it's one of those like you like 60 mile-an-hour racing

20
00:01:57,509 --> 00:01:58,350
drones

21
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:03,929
let me stand subject today's video is going to be just about my sunglasses

22
00:02:03,929 --> 00:02:06,060
when

23
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,060
and

24
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,580
a long time you got somebody asked Jack Nicholson why he always wears sunglasses

25
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:20,100
and he responded when I'm not wearing sunglasses and just another old guy and

26
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,990
what i am wearing sunglasses

27
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:29,670
I'm Jack Nicholson you wanted to get me on my back just had to ask the following

28
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:34,770
scene is not sponsored by Norman affiliation with this

29
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:37,770
sunglass store

30
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,580
you have those

31
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:49,210
does your sunglasses they are my sunglasses

32
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:54,940
not as good as yours but do you ever wear sunglasses at night always really

33
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:55,900
working with them

34
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:02,410
I'm Casey Casey black on black ok let's see let's see who these are virgin

35
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,720
glasses they feel so good

36
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,970
all right you mind your mind that's why thank you i was really nice to meet you

37
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:16,870
now I just want to be super duper clear this is not an endorsement of this brand

38
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:20,740
these glasses are the only box that fit on my gigantic head

39
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:24,280
so that's why I wear them if you're thinking of making your glasses

40
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,280
I just find a pair that works for you and start there

41
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:38,820
Chloe asked hey Chloe

42
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:42,720
on a scale of one to 10 how much does candice dislike me wearing my glasses

43
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,140
it's not that she doesn't like me wearing the glasses that she doesn't

44
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:50,250
like me wearing the glasses like when I'm not outside when it's not sunny out

45
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:54,720
has anyone ever has anyone ever stolen a pair from you

46
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,100
I know this can ever accuse you of using them to check out other beautiful

47
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:04,410
no no how often do you get new ones well I did just get a new pair but typically

48
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,630
like less than once a year

49
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:10,110
I rarely lose them that's one of the good parts of always wearing them is

50
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:12,180
that you always know where they are

51
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:16,860
do you wear them all the time off camera not really how much they cost i think

52
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,570
they're like a hundred and fifty dollars

53
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:23,820
- the scraping are you uncomfortable showing your eyes know what spray paint

54
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,230
brandi is

55
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:33,570
ah krylon the spray-painted champions

56
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:36,810
why do you make your nice glasses look like they came from the dollar store

57
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:42,090
well I think nice is in the eye of the beholder that was the plan words i think

58
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:47,970
these glasses are nicer because I made them then some glasses that were made in

59
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:49,350
italy in a factory

60
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:52,890
just because their new doesn't mean they're nice I don't think those are

61
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:55,410
nice i think those are generic these are mine

62
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:59,550
how do you keep them clean I don't throw is filthy do you sleep with them on no

63
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:03,060
but they're usually on my bedside table when i wake up

64
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:08,460
here's a good question Oscar asks why do you buy real expensive ray-bans remove

65
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:12,030
the logo instead of buying cheap fake words because these are actually higher

66
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:13,380
quality glasses

67
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:17,070
what makes a Mercedes or Lamborghini nice is not just the thing that says

68
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:21,419
mercedes lamborghini it's actually a better car if you're right Lamborghini

69
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:24,840
on a Hyundai it wouldn't be a Lamborghini would be a Hyundai that says

70
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,919
Lamborghini

71
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,850
so these are actually really good quality glasses that's glass not plastic

72
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:33,810
in their top and I wear them every day and they don't break

73
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:37,500
usually so I like to wear good glasses

74
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,930
I just don't like the name brand

75
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:42,830
so i take it off Casey when are you going to make another pair

76
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:47,060
how about right now making these things

77
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:50,780
it's not that hard I don't know how many pair of made over the years

78
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:54,830
the truth is I don't lose them and they don't really break but they do expire

79
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:59,720
it's like all the balance in the plastic that makes up the frame it just starts

80
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,039
to stretch out in time

81
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:08,090
right now I'm scraping the logo off of the lens see what I have a tendency to

82
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:12,919
lose things and i'm making me so I've got a fresh pair and then this old

83
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:17,810
parent here will become my back up here just taking out the logo there you will

84
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,009
paint in it

85
00:06:19,009 --> 00:06:25,610
the last step here just hit them with the tape you break every rule spray

86
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:30,020
painting is what you wanted you wanted to sink into the cracks II just flooded

87
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:35,300
with me

88
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,850
that is the sloppiest worst spray paint job you'll ever seen you do

89
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:45,669
now I'll just leave them there to sit over night when I wake up in the morning

90
00:06:45,669 --> 00:06:48,400
I'll strip the paint off and they look kind of like these

91
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,660
probably just a touch more paint now the biggest question that I get asked is why

92
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:55,480
why do I always wear sunglasses

93
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,540
the first part of the answer is I just like the glasses look there's a really

94
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,950
pragmatic reason

95
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:03,910
ok you know how when I'm talking to camera i'm talking camera right now I

96
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:07,180
can always point at things like hey look at this screen right here or come out

97
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:11,050
these lights behind me or check out this blue lunch box right here or this movie

98
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:12,760
poster movie produced right there

99
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:17,260
The Godfather it's right here I'm not looking into the lens i'm looking into

100
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:21,160
this screen right here and now i can frame things up I know what I'm looking

101
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:21,669
at

102
00:07:21,669 --> 00:07:25,990
but what I do with my glasses off I don't look like I'm looking at you

103
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:30,100
I look over here so like imagine if in all my blogs

104
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:34,180
I'm looking like this it starts to feel really weird I can look at here and then

105
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,880
look over there try to pretend to look over there

106
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,180
but in the end it's just like if i want to point this I can either look over

107
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:47,229
here or I look here and just sort of guess but what I have classes on it

108
00:07:47,229 --> 00:07:49,360
always looks like i'm looking at camera

109
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,229
so that's why I started wearing glasses and all my blogs

110
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:57,130
it's like a really practical reason that's why i was having fun at night is

111
00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:01,990
just like it's the only way I can check my framing without having to look weird

112
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:05,560
I would see when people log and they're not looking into the lens it's like it

113
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,669
did it doesn't

114
00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:10,120
what about my class about your

115
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:14,320
they're awesome but you want to know what not

116
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,740
nothing was young you up with them on them because your eyes are so cute and

117
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,770
pretty and then you cover them with these glasses

118
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:25,630
I know what you're talking about just such pretty brown

119
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:36,659
just like my glasses

120
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,849
ok

121
00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:44,849
that's it

122
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:53,050
will you help me cut my hair tonight

123
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:57,820
no why not
