00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,700
crushed up some crackers and instead of

54
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,070

let me see what you got so I turned the

58
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,060
bread into ash by burning it then I use

59
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,459
a liquid nitrogen to harden the cheese

60
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,620
then I threw it at a plate from a

61
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,940
20-foot ladder and then created this

62
