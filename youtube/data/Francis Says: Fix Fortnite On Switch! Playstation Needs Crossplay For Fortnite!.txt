consumer decisions getting into bed with

00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,010
EA and then do shit

73
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:14,569

74
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:15,709
stupid shit and you were down here

75
00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:17,060

games being all consumer friendly hey so

77
00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:20,599

78
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:22,610
swaps you around we just do this oh shit

79
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:24,530
faster in the garbage but must be

80
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:26,150
something about the altitude all the way

81
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,190
up there on top okay because you guys

82

your consumers just like xmarks dead now

84
00:02:32,269 --> 00:02:33,530

85
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:36,200
generation assholes alright it's simple

86
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,450

PlayStation we're listening we're

91
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,379
listening hey I got an idea how about to

92
00:02:45,379 --> 00:02:46,549
get our guys to actually fix something

93
00:02:46,549 --> 00:02:48,560
instead of just listening actually do

94
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,989
something and now it's going so bad that

95
00:02:50,989 --> 00:02:53,690
even the living meme himself Todd Howard

96
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:56,780
the the walking cringefest that is Todd

97
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,390
Howard has single-handedly blamed your

98
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:02,690
company and your policies for fallout 76

99
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:04,879
not having crossed me because all you

100
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,209
guys do is listen okay Todd Howard later

101
00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:11,030
rating diarrhea down on your head and

102
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,829
this generation isn't even older how do

103
00:03:12,829 --> 00:03:14,180

00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:40,430
the chosen one okay I know it's not as

112
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:43,010
easy as pressing a button I understand

113
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:45,919

114
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:48,169
