1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:06,210
I made this video last week basic thesis

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,550
of the videos that youtube doesn't do

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,519
enough to support their community that

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,380
is creators in the platform I didn't

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,700
release it so that I was too harsh a

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,890
critique and then this morning I look at

7
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,119
my I look at the creator app here and I

8
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,340
saw that this travel vlog which is the

9
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,619
most innocuous vlog ever it's literally

10
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:28,830
me going to Indonesia to sit down with

11
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,960
the president of Indonesia was

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,870
demonetized so here's my kind of long

13
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:37,500
and boring but critical commentary on

14
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,879
YouTube and how they should do a better

15
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,050
job looking after their community last

16
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:45,120
week there's a gigantic controversy here

17
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,039
on YouTube a controversy that I found

18
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,500
myself just accidentally at the very

19
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,270
heart of it had to do with D

20
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,329
monetization and hypocrisy and unfair

21
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:56,489
treatment of one channel over another on

22
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:58,829
YouTube and in the end I think YouTube

23
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:00,239
might actually be changing policy

24
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,039
because of the uproar if you don't know

25
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:03,840
what I'm talking about I will link Phil

26
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,030
DeFranco his video on the subject below

27
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,670
Phil does an absolutely fantastic job of

28
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,320
explaining the circumstances around that

29
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,790
controversy controversy is coming Joe

30
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:16,020
there's always me something people are

31
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,970
upset about when you have as big of a

32
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:20,729
user base as YouTube has what caught me

33
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:22,920
I froze just how upset a huge swath of

34
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,680
the YouTube community was at YouTube and

35
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,600
and not just because of this controversy

36
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,460
this controversy just proved to be sort

37
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,770
of a catalyst for a lot of the community

38
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:34,890
to speak up about what upsets them about

39
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:36,530
YouTube

40
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:43,970
I genuinely don't feel YouTube does

41
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,890
enough to take care of and look after

42
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:47,119
their community

43
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:48,799
now before I unpacked that let me just

44
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,020
say I'm a huge fan of YouTube I am so

45
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,940
much of my career to YouTube I traveled

46
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:55,430
the world evangelizing YouTube I want

47
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:57,729
this platform to succeed also I

48
00:01:57,729 --> 00:01:59,990
personally know much of the leadership

49
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:02,509
team the executive team at YouTube I

50
00:02:02,509 --> 00:02:05,780
truly believe that in their heart they

51
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,759
think and they're working towards doing

52
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,679
what they feel is the very best not just

53
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,480
for YouTube's bottom line but for

54
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,430
everybody that is the community creators

55
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:16,459
the viewers everybody on YouTube I think

56
00:02:16,459 --> 00:02:18,410
they think that they're really doing the

57
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:20,360
best they could do I just don't agree

58
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,890
with them I don't think that they're

59
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:24,590
doing enough for the community that's

60
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:28,519
what I want to talk about any business

61
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:30,560
in order to be successful you have to do

62
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,420
things that your competition isn't doing

63
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,470
you have to have a product that people

64
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,690
want over whatever the competition is

65
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:37,280
and then this is my very naive

66
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,900
understanding of YouTube's business so

67
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,940
the first tentacle of their business is

68
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,040
search search is the way my dad uses

69
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,360
YouTube he can't figure out how to use a

70
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,040
cell phone he Google's it and he lands

71
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,420
on YouTube watching a video as to how to

72
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,220
fix his cell phone next is you have

73
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,049
YouTube red YouTube red subscription

74
00:02:51,049 --> 00:02:53,120
service ten bucks a month the original

75
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,590
content so good you're willing to give

76
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,540
them that money so you can see their

77
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:59,600
unique original content YouTube TV is 35

78
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,370
bucks a month and you get what is

79
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:03,320
normally on regular TV but on YouTube

80
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,090
with some other features alright the

81
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:06,560
last and what I think is certainly the

82
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,880
biggest part at least from my

83
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,040
perspective of YouTube's business is the

84
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,290
YouTube community that's most likely

85
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,060
most of you watching this video people

86
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,560
who subscribe to other people's channels

87
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,799
people who upload people who a big

88
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:20,840
gigantic community that is a web of

89
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,519
people all over the world that

90
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:24,590
contribute that consume that considerate

91
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,329
YouTube a part of who they are and what

92
00:03:26,329 --> 00:03:28,489
they do and just judging anecdotally

93
00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:30,019
from what I've been able to gather and

94
00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:31,070
when I see all the time in a

95
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:32,299
conversation that just doesn't seem to

96
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:34,880
die is that a lot of the community is

97
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,700
unhappy with YouTube the more I think

98
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,760
about it the more I empathize with that

99
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,250
perspective

100
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:46,750
I think the community being upset is an

101
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,180
existential threat to YouTube's entire

102
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,970
business meaning that if if this

103
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:54,250
community isn't happy if this community

104
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,140
isn't constantly psyched about what

105
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,210
YouTube is doing anything could prove to

106
00:03:58,210 --> 00:03:59,650
be a crack in the foundation of the

107
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:00,790
company that is YouTube that could

108
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:02,770
ultimately give way and be extremely

109
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:08,140
disruptive to their business so let's

110
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,000
rewind a couple months back to ad

111
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,500
pocalypse which is earlier this year

112
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,570
some controversial content put on

113
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:15,130
YouTube that had ads in front of it

114
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,680
advertisers flipped out and they didn't

115
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,090
want to be in front of this content they

116
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:21,250
went to YouTube YouTube immediately bent

117
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,320
over what can we change how can we

118
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,120
please you advertisers so you'll

119
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,460
continue to advertise on this platform a

120
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,980
lot of creators a lot of that community

121
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:32,830
got hit very very hard so my friend saw

122
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:36,370
a drop literally of 80% imagine you have

123
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:38,110
a day job you work 9:00 to 5:00 five

124
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,820
days a week you show up for those 40

125
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,410
hours you work as hard as you can and

126
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:43,750
for that you are paid 500 dollars a week

127
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,790
that's your take home 500 bucks a week

128
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:48,010
then ad pocalypse something completely

129
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:49,120
out of your control something that you

130
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,640
had no part of on either side and now

131
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,960
you're still showing up at work you're

132
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,190
still working from 9:00 to 5:00 you're

133
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,479
putting in your 40 hours a week you're

134
00:04:55,479 --> 00:04:57,250
still busting your ass but instead of

135
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,110
even paid that 500 bucks a week your

136
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:01,840
take-home is now 100 dollars a week okay

137
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,419
that sucks but happens now imagine

138
00:05:04,419 --> 00:05:06,460
this your boss doesn't tell you what's

139
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,020
going on you can't get in touch with

140
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,490
your boss you don't know how to get in

141
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:11,229
touch with your boss you look around for

142
00:05:11,229 --> 00:05:12,640
answers there are no answers anywhere

143
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,930
and there's no one telling you what's

144
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:14,650
going on

145
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:16,419
will your income ever come back is it

146
00:05:16,419 --> 00:05:18,160
ever gonna go back to where it was how

147
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,900
long until it goes back to where it was

148
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,090
why is my income being affected even

149
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:23,140
though I'm being the same thing I've

150
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,669
always done and I wasn't part of the

151
00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:26,140
problem to begin with the thing that was

152
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,360
most troubling for me of all of that was

153
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,100
the lack of communication the lack of

154
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,560
transparency on the part of YouTube the

155
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,050
boss to the people showing up for work

156
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:36,790
every day which is the community that

157
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:38,979
people are uploading with a regular

158
00:05:38,979 --> 00:05:40,300
schedule putting the same amount of work

159
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,530
the same amount of energy and the same

160
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:43,300
amount of expense into the content

161
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,919
they're creating but now they're getting

162
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:46,330
paid only a fraction of what they did

163
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:48,850
okay so YouTube's reaction to to their

164
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:51,370
advertisers was loud and was clear we're

165
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:53,080
going to fix this our trust and safety

166
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,550
issues are going to be made number one

167
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:55,289
we will

168
00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:56,789
take care of this this is a great place

169
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:58,020
for you to advertise we can give you all

170
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,639
kinds of new tools to make this possible

171
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,770
what they weren't loud about least to

172
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:04,439
the community as I understood it was how

173
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:05,580
those changes are going to affect the

174
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,289
community how they can aid the community

175
00:06:07,289 --> 00:06:09,180
what changes the community should expect

176
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,999
and on and so what does this feel like

177
00:06:11,999 --> 00:06:13,499
from the community's perspective it's

178
00:06:13,499 --> 00:06:16,469
that advertisers are a bigger priority

179
00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:21,960
to this platform than the community so

180
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,219
that when this controversy takes place

181
00:06:23,219 --> 00:06:25,349
last week wherein they D monetize a

182
00:06:25,349 --> 00:06:27,240
creators video for talking about a

183
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,849
tragedy but not Jimmy Kimmel one of

184
00:06:29,849 --> 00:06:31,469
their bigger more corporate partners

185
00:06:31,469 --> 00:06:33,659
it's sort of reeks of hypocrisy and

186
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:35,309
again the community the community felt

187
00:06:35,309 --> 00:06:37,110
like a second-class citizen the

188
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,610
community felt like much less of a

189
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:41,039
priority to the platform than these

190
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,459
bigger more mainstream outlets and that

191
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:47,219
that is the problem the community not

192
00:06:47,219 --> 00:06:55,499
feeling good about the platform this

193
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:57,180
part of YouTube's business this is

194
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,339
duplicatable somebody else could do this

195
00:06:59,339 --> 00:07:01,289
they might do it better but this isn't

196
00:07:01,289 --> 00:07:01,979
enough

197
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:04,199
this here original programming YouTube's

198
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:05,969
doing good work there I believe will do

199
00:07:05,969 --> 00:07:07,110
better work in the future

200
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:09,389
but even so YouTube spending a couple

201
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:10,680
hundred million bucks a year on original

202
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,749
programming Netflix is spending 7

203
00:07:12,749 --> 00:07:14,879
billion I think you can objectively say

204
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:16,379
that in this facet of their business

205
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:18,240
YouTube's trying to play catch-up but

206
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,629
this is a long play TV will TV it's the

207
00:07:21,629 --> 00:07:23,699
community that makes YouTube special

208
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:25,619
community is the only thing that that

209
00:07:25,619 --> 00:07:27,689
none of YouTube's competition has the

210
00:07:27,689 --> 00:07:29,599
community is what makes YouTube

211
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,949
extraordinary community is the one thing

212
00:07:31,949 --> 00:07:33,899
that none of their competitors have been

213
00:07:33,899 --> 00:07:37,379
able to copy it's the it's the You Tube

214
00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:41,879
community community community that

215
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:44,789
provides the armor that the body armor

216
00:07:44,789 --> 00:07:46,889
that YouTube needs against competition

217
00:07:46,889 --> 00:07:49,409
no matter what they do they're not going

218
00:07:49,409 --> 00:07:51,230
to get through this

219
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:55,340
I think that this disruption could take

220
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:58,010
place when when two things happen the

221
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:00,500
first thing being a competitor shows up

222
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:04,190
a competitor that gives creators access

223
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:07,160
to a bigger audience and gives creators

224
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,020
better opportunities to monetize their

225
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,270
content so the first thing that has to

226
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,950
happen is is a really viable competitor

227
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,620
to YouTube the second thing that has to

228
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,510
happen is for the community to have lost

229
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:21,260
faith in YouTube I don't think that's

230
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,150
happened I hope that never happens but

231
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:26,120
if those two things the community loses

232
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,860
faith and then there's a competitor that

233
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,420
offers a bigger audience and a better

234
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,310
way to monetize I think there's a very

235
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,680
real chance for disruption within the

236
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,180
entire YouTube community

237
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,979
and this is not apples to apples here

238
00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:39,260
but I point to vine vine is a company

239
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,820
that had tens of millions maybe hundreds

240
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,130
of millions of monthly active users it

241
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:45,500
was a vibrant vibrant vibrant platform

242
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,280
but when the top 20 top 20 of their top

243
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,430
50 creators felt like there wasn't real

244
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:54,110
opportunity to make a living off the

245
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,700
platform and they went to the powers

246
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,740
that be within that platform asking for

247
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:00,080
more and they weren't given what they

248
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,240
needed to feel taking care of

249
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,480
they left vine and about a year later

250
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,130
the entire platform had to shut down

251
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,410
there were a lot of factors why vine ran

252
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:10,610
out of business but that was certainly

253
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:12,830
one of them a little bit of irony the

254
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:14,720
majority of those top miners that left

255
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,460
the competing platform that offered a

256
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,200
better way to monetize and a broader

257
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,360
audience was in fact YouTube

258
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,840
[Music]

259
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,430
when I think back to the height the peak

260
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,590
of ad pocalypse I'd never heard the word

261
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:29,200
twitch used so much within the YouTube

262
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,270
community before people announcing their

263
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,860
twitch shows and what their intentions

264
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:33,940
were people going there who weren't

265
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,980
gamers people really redefining what

266
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,770
that platform was true enthusiasm for

267
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:40,540
competitor when you think about Netflix

268
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,280
or Amazon or Hulu or any of these other

269
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,740
digital distribution platforms right now

270
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,330
they've all got money they're all

271
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:47,590
willing to spend money and they're

272
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:48,730
trying to figure out how to diversify

273
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:50,980
their audience in a way that in a way

274
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,960
that could ultimately invite them to

275
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,270
knock on the door of this community they

276
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:57,250
may want a piece of this this is a story

277
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,290
yesterday amazon to compete with youtube

278
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:02,250
ad opportunities now this isn't exactly

279
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,660
literally a story that's about poaching

280
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,730
the community but I think it is I think

281
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:08,410
it does illustrate the competition is

282
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:10,090
looking to YouTube saying how can we get

283
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:15,220
a piece of that so where does this leave

284
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,870
us because this video is not just I

285
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,190
didn't just make this video so I get

286
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:20,470
bitch I made this video because I wanted

287
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:22,810
to share my thinking with this my

288
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:24,130
audience and maybe even share my

289
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:25,870
thinking with some people at YouTube who

290
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:28,060
might be seeing this solutions what are

291
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,070
solutions that could be made short

292
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:31,990
answer I don't know it's not my 40

293
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:33,640
billion dollar company I'm just part of

294
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,900
this community that wants to see this

295
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,090
platform succeed so no I don't I don't

296
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:38,980
really have any real solutions but I've

297
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:41,050
said well one idea so going back to the

298
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:44,190
the Jimmy Kimmel tragedy monetization

299
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:47,200
situation turns out that Jimmy Kimmel

300
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,330
was able to sell his own ads against his

301
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,010
own content on YouTube meaning that

302
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:52,900
instead of relying on YouTube to sell

303
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,580
commercials to go in front of his videos

304
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,260
they have their own team that sells them

305
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:59,050
autonomously from the platform may be at

306
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:00,400
an increased rate I don't know the

307
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,920
details are not public but maybe why

308
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,410
maybe can I or why can't I sell my own

309
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:08,860
ads why why not build us creators or at

310
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,360
least creators that make a living off

311
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,490
this platform why not build us a suite

312
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:14,260
of tools or a marketplace wherein we

313
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,360
could advertise our channel and what our

314
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,390
channel represents and maybe suggest

315
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:20,380
advertisers are demographics that we

316
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,690
feel might dovetail the vest with the

317
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:24,190
content that we're putting out there and

318
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:26,500
because of that raise our premiums or

319
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,420
something like that why not give us

320
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:31,210
greater agency over how our content is

321
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:32,080
monetized

322
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,850
that way when there is a situation like

323
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:34,430
an ad

324
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:36,680
klipsch we're not collectively punished

325
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,779
along with the people who caused the

326
00:11:38,779 --> 00:11:41,120
controversy in the first place just a

327
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:41,570
thought

328
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:43,820
here's a small one your trending page I

329
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:46,490
love your trending page because I'm on

330
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:48,500
your trending page every single week I

331
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,470
don't know why I appreciate it but every

332
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,000
time I'm on the trending page I'm cites

333
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,770
it needs more views but but I go to

334
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:56,330
Twitter and a lot of the community is

335
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:59,240
gently angry at me because it seems

336
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,760
unfair that I'm always there so is it

337
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,110
that there's a person at YouTube that

338
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:04,610
maybe it's just likes my work and that's

339
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:06,800
why I'm always there is it the algorithm

340
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,600
I don't know but maybe a little bit of

341
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,279
transparency there maybe something that

342
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:14,360
shows us the creators why I'm there icon

343
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,430
that just says like staff pic or an icon

344
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:18,560
that says like surging in the algorithm

345
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,959
or an icon that says paid if there are

346
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,940
videos that are allowed to be paid to be

347
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:25,730
put on the trending page and that comes

348
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:26,810
back to the same two principles

349
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:29,660
communication transparency another one

350
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,640
about about compensation and this seems

351
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,779
kind of like a no-brainer

352
00:12:32,779 --> 00:12:35,240
right now creators on your platform get

353
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,399
paid based on the amount of ads that can

354
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:38,870
run against their videos more video

355
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,940
views the more money that's great very

356
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:43,310
clean transaction but that just means

357
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:45,170
the communities getting paid one time

358
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:47,600
for that one ad meanwhile YouTube the

359
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,910
company is growing is increasing in

360
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:52,100
value broadly what about something where

361
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,890
we can choose to be paid in in YouTube

362
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:57,140
or in Google stock or in some sort of

363
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:59,029
way that would appreciate along with the

364
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:00,890
growth of the company I know that would

365
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:03,080
make me feel more vested in the platform

366
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,450
as a creator and this one's less of an

367
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:08,390
actionable more of an idea but the

368
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,890
Kardashians show Keeping Up the

369
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:12,020
Kardashians it's on Bravo or E or

370
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,580
something like that whatever a new

371
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,200
season comes out every billboard in the

372
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,730
country is plastered with Kim

373
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:17,870
Kardashian's face

374
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,850
she's celebrated she's put on TV she's

375
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:22,000
in magazines they're everywhere because

376
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,920
the channel that hosts her show wants to

377
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,870
make sure that people know it's taking

378
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:29,390
place Kim Kardashian her family is

379
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:31,610
celebrated by the platform that

380
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:33,890
distributes her content one thing that I

381
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:36,260
see very very little of is YouTube as a

382
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,779
company celebrating its community what

383
00:13:38,779 --> 00:13:40,880
that means I don't really know is it

384
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,589
more support is it literally putting

385
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:44,360
people's faces on Billboard's is it a

386
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,880
way of elevating new creators is it a

387
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,220
way

388
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,930
I like I said I don't know what the

389
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:50,459
actionable czar here but I do think

390
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:51,779
there's but I do think that there should

391
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:53,970
be a much broader initiative to show

392
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:56,699
like a real appreciation for what this

393
00:13:56,699 --> 00:13:58,649
entire community has brought to this

394
00:13:58,649 --> 00:14:00,990
platform and that's something I see very

395
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:05,430
very little of all right I think I

396
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:07,259
should stop there I could keep going at

397
00:14:07,259 --> 00:14:09,720
nauseam this video is literally just a

398
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,850
video version of a conversation I have

399
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:14,160
with my YouTube peers all the time but I

400
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,250
love and I believe in and I want YouTube

401
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,800
to succeed on every level and when I see

402
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,959
the community feeling upset towards the

403
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:25,350
platform itself it bothers me so I want

404
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:26,699
to use this channel to speak up about

405
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:30,550
that all right thank you

407
00:14:31,939 --> 00:14:35,100
this is a regrettably perfect ending to

408
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,589
this video remember that I remember the

409
00:14:37,589 --> 00:14:39,269
first shot of this video where I started

410
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:41,339
by saying YouTube had demonetised a

411
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:44,009
really innocuous video of mine I travel

412
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:46,050
vlog right where I went to Indonesia I

413
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:48,029
appealed their decision to demonetised

414
00:14:48,029 --> 00:14:50,129
it meaning that I was right it shouldn't

415
00:14:50,129 --> 00:14:51,029
have been d-minus

416
00:14:51,029 --> 00:14:52,709
and what do you know look at that

417
00:14:52,709 --> 00:14:55,379
YouTube agreed with me Andrey monetized

418
00:14:55,379 --> 00:14:57,120
it and because of that because their

419
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,790
algorithm made the wrong call it costs

420
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,529
me now I don't know how you feel about

421
00:15:01,529 --> 00:15:03,689
having your income reduced because your

422
00:15:03,689 --> 00:15:05,610
well whoever writes your checks screwed

423
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:07,589
up but it doesn't make me feel good I

424
00:15:07,589 --> 00:15:09,600
don't think it makes the community feel

425
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,510
good either
