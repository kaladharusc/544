22
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:21,440
this house buying this house is like one of the most proud moments of my entire

23
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,820
life

24
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:26,060
see this neighborhood with the cool beach I didn't grow up here

25
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:30,530
I grew up and kind of like a less nice part of the hood across the river

26
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:35,420
I always wanted to live here and after Owen my older kid after his mom and I

27
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,200
broke up

28
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,020
I you know I immediately moved to New York City but I would come back here

29
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:42,290
three days a week side be in new york city monday thursday friday saturday

30
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:44,390
sunday i'll be here to be with my kiddo

31
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:48,680
and at first we would have a place to stay we stay in the attic of my dad's

32
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,210
coffee shop for a while

33
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:54,320
we stayed at my grandmother's couch and like slowly creeped up like eventually

34
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,410
we got his tiny apartment where he and i slept on the bunk beds

35
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,340
dad

36
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,840
nice one

37
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:19,310
we rented this small house and then

38
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:39,750
today is remember 20th remember twentieth two thousand sep tember 2008

39
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:48,840
2009 and that was like such it was such a big moment for me was the first time I

40
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,980
open the door after I closed on the house I have the keys and lock the door

41
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:58,890
I was like this is our home now and if you can imagine what it feels like to

42
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,270
explain to your kid

43
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:05,310
why you're sleeping in an unfurnished addict as a parent like that was

44
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:10,620
humiliating for me anything sort of the sort of flip that over like in verse

45
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:15,030
that that was the pride that i felt when i finally bought this house for own and

46
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:18,030
me

47
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:27,620
what are you doing going to the house

48
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:36,080
what's special about today it's we've actually got a house you might a lot of

49
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,080
money out of your music money

50
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:43,349
I mean what is almost is almost in the latter morning to you

51
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:48,060
that's a good question and have you made my millions of dollars

52
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:52,270
No are you a rich men

53
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:56,680
when it's watching me you have a lot of positions a lot of money in the bank

54
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,900
position make you rich

55
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:02,140
I don't I don't have that type of richness my race is life

56
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:21,099
yeah

57
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:28,790
yeah

58
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:34,870
yeah

59
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:47,139
rather shirt I just don't look at it

60
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:54,580
I made this for Candis like 10 years ago and left this is candice Indian South

61
00:05:54,580 --> 00:06:00,280
Africa 2006 this is ten years ago

62
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:09,190
look how young this house made me feel like a grown-up

63
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,680
one of the reasons why i love Candis so much is that when we started dating the

64
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:20,260
first time she came to Connecticut with me she slept on the couch at my Nana's

65
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:23,080
house his own and I didn't have a place to stay here

66
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:27,700
so right like the journey that was this house on canvas and everything like she

67
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:31,870
was around when it was like really when our lives are like really kind of we

68
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:33,100
really struggled

69
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:38,500
okay all right are you going to get transferred elsewhere tell home

70
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:46,540
you look great in your life goes on and one hasn't been a baby for a while

71
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:50,020
he's going to college in like two weeks this house last couple years has gone

72
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:54,550
from this like the thing of pride in my life this burden because we feel like we

73
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:57,160
have to come here it's very hard to get here with the baby

74
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,250
Owen doesn't even want to hang out here and he works he has like a car and a job

75
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:04,390
and life just keeps going

76
00:07:05,289 --> 00:07:10,570
you've got to keep living man alive ein em

77
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,700
yeah

78
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:24,590
all right that's it

79
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:28,580
most likely the last or at least close to the last time I'll ever walk out of

80
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:31,580
that door again

81
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:40,360
yeah

82
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,000
what you said

83
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
really sad

84
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:53,540
you go to helping

85
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:56,580
now let's take a picture

86
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:59,529
yeah

87
00:07:59,529 --> 00:08:03,129
yeah

88
00:08:05,529 --> 00:08:07,889
yeah

89
00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:11,969
yeah

90
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:15,730
hmm
