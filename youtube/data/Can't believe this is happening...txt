38
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:45,840
general saying how I died I don't like

Minecraft the Minecraft community

40
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,380
minecraft is all that stuff you

41
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,000
know just just to break it down I just

42
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,670
really want to say I've been I was

43
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,710
bitter for a little while at you know

44
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,479
just minecraft in the Minecraft

45
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,509
community itself realizing really

46
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:06,149
actually you know yeah being a little

47
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:08,340
selfish here I just I just like to be a

48
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:13,170
little bitter and that and you know just

49
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:13,630
in game

50
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,970
in general I started doing my own thing

51
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:19,720
I start doing reactions and you know

52
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,370
I've been doing reactions for a long

53
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:22,990
time now

54
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:26,260
probably even pretty close to the same

55
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:29,380
amount of time that I did minecraft on

56
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:33,880
this channel and you know I wouldn't be

57
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:37,060
honest I actually I really do miss

58
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:40,540
minecraft I miss general gaming I I miss

59
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,940
you know just you know stuff I did

60
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,710
nostalgic stuff I don't know if it's

61
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:46,930
just a nostalgic feeling and I'm just

62
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,640
honestly just kind of bored of reactions

63
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,280
right now or not really bored is I've

64
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,020
just done so many reaction videos I just

65
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:58,180
I really can't find anymore to do but

66
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:03,550
that being said I am right now in a

67
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:08,980
little like thinking sphere in my head

68
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,810
thinking what I want to do on this

69
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:14,770
channel for the future I have honestly

70
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:17,050
really missed being a Minecraft content

71
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:19,050
creator

72
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:22,570
hence what whatever anybody says you

73
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:24,640
know actually really was pretty fun to

74
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,800
be honest it was it was I had a fun time

75
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,930
it was a fun time and it was still

76
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:31,240
categorized as gaming and I do like

77
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,490
gaming even though sometimes I can get

78
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:36,370
really bored of it III do miss it I do I

79
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:39,670
do miss it a lot and that that's the

80
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:41,560
thing you know about being gone from

81
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,450
minecraft for so long I've been gone for

82
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:45,460
so long I kind of you know actually kind

83
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:48,360
of regret it I should have kept it in

84
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,590
even if it was another channel I should

85
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:53,020
have just kept it going there's a lot of

86
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,790
things I've ever you know regretted I

87
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:56,200
should have kept on doing I mean yeah I

88
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,230
can make a reaction video get 400k views

89
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:03,490
and plop it's alright but I mean it's

90
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:06,760
just I don't know why it just doesn't

91
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,920
feel right anymore

92
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,260
um I don't I really don't know if I want

93
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,240
to you know go back to general gaming

94
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,299
what what I want to do but I I don't

95
00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:19,150
know if I want to do like I really just

96
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:21,580
can't do real life vlogs I really don't

97
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:23,560
do that much where it's like interesting

98
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,440
and I really am not that type of person

99
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,500
to be fake on

100
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,990
camera I can go out and be like oh yeah

101
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:35,150
yeah Jake Paul and um it's I can't

102
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:38,600
really do that so you know I've had

103
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,790
different ideas for challenged videos -

104
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:43,610
I like challenge videos but right now I

105
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:46,340
mean I'm in a pickle between two things

106
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,800
I either want to you know start up and

107
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,050
start producing some real life challenge

108
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:53,300
videos not reaction to actual challenge

109
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,800
videos which I think would be pretty fun

110
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,400
and the only issue I have that some of

111
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,620
the video ideas that have planned they

112
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,300
are a little bit mature and good old

113
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,880
YouTube likes to shut down mature

114
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,700
content and not get ads on it and

115
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,730
nonetheless this is my job as well and I

116
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:13,280
need to monetize as best as I can so I

117
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,980
can continue being a content creator

118
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,360
because I like being a content creator

119
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,560
it's just YouTube is pretty stupid it's

120
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:25,910
pretty darn stupid but um you know these

121
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,980
next two days guys I'm gonna be doing

122
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,419
some more heart thinking I just wanted

123
00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:31,130
to get this video out for you guys to

124
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:35,120
know so you guys have a basic idea but

125
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,430
uh you know in these next next couple

126
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:38,990
days I'm gonna be thinking I'm gonna be

127
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,910
thinking what the next path of this

128
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:45,950
channel is and either way I'm gonna make

129
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:48,470
it good I'll make it good thank you guys

130
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:50,600
for listening I kept it kind of short

131
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,710
and simple let me know in the comments

132
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:56,500
like well what would you like to see

133
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,290
because I mean I I guess you know I'm

134
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:02,960
basically being shut down for brewing

135
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,250
super not like I mean I could I can be

136
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:10,640
me but I just can't be that vulgar or I

137
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,169
can't even a lot of the reactions I've

138
00:06:12,169 --> 00:06:14,150
done or even like you know simple

139
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,820
reactions have you know vulgar jokes in

140
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,220
it so I guess you know just YouTube just

141
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,690
doesn't allow that shizzle nizzle

142
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:25,640
anymore which is a shame but um you know

143
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:29,780
I I I think I don't I don't really want

144
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,190
to protest it because they're gonna

145
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,540
YouTube is gonna do what they're gonna

146
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,880
do and at the end of the day I really

147
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,440
just want to put my interest in content

148
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,539
creating no matter what I have to do

149
00:06:38,539 --> 00:06:40,789
obviously I'm not gonna be fake

150
00:06:40,789 --> 00:06:43,789
like a lot of people but no matter what

151
00:06:43,789 --> 00:06:47,210
I just love creating content and you

152
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:48,620
know I just got to think of a new game

153
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,379
plan

154
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:53,960
just just because I would rather do

155
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:58,569
content create contents you know that is

156
00:06:58,569 --> 00:07:01,729
you know acceptable by the standards of

157
00:07:01,729 --> 00:07:05,779
the community guidelines and then you

158
00:07:05,779 --> 00:07:07,969
know get a boatload of views by not

159
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:10,999
following the community guidelines so

160
00:07:10,999 --> 00:07:15,020
yeah whatever but you know thank you so

161
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,460
much for watching my name is dead bucks

162
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,000
and peace out
