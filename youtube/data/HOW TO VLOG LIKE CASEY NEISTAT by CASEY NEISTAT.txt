00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:27,399
what is up with this weather June 6

3
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:29,689
summer should be here already

4
00:00:29,689 --> 00:00:35,469
nothing sustained hold rainy everything

5
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:54,290
these guys are good thank you minutes if

6
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:57,170
you're if you're a regular viewer of

7
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:59,470
this show you know just how much my

8
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:03,129
happiness and good mood and just general

9
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:05,869
positivity is tied to the weather

10
00:01:05,869 --> 00:01:07,640
you'd also know that all inter long I've

11
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:12,300
been waiting for summer

15
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,509
I'm trying to illustrate a point here

16
00:01:44,509 --> 00:01:45,380
which is that it rains a

17
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,000
disproportionate amount of days in New

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,340
York City but as I'm making charging and

19
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,140
looking at the data I'm realizing it

20
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:54,379
rains on average 11 to 15 percent of the

21
00:01:54,379 --> 00:01:56,899
days kind of making me feel like a

22
00:01:56,899 --> 00:01:58,939
little bit of a spur complaining about

23
00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:00,560
it so much maybe I should have looked

24
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,079
this up before I did this whole scene so

25
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:09,229
is it pouring and outside was it pouring

26
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,729
rain outside today seems like an

27
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:12,680
opportune day to make a video I've

28
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,019
wanted to make for a very long time

29
00:02:14,019 --> 00:02:18,170
called I wanted to explain to you the

30
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:20,660
audience exactly how I make my vlogs

31
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:24,019
like what I see as the recipe for

32
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:31,010
creating these videos first a quick

33
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:33,410
history lesson I started vlogging in

34
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:37,130
March of 2015 now before I started

35
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:39,019
vlogging vlogging was typically

36
00:02:39,019 --> 00:02:41,000
individuals Karen like point-and-shoot

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,950
cameras there were sort of documenting

38
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:45,319
their day into a camera there was a much

39
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:47,510
smaller genre back then and it was

40
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:50,030
pretty linear day begins here day ends

41
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:50,480
there

42
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,579
come with me throughout my day I found

43
00:02:52,579 --> 00:02:54,440
the genre fascinating I was obsessed

44
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,690
with like Ben Brown I was obsessed with

45
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:59,599
fun for Louie I was obsessed with bf

46
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,239
versus GF Charles Trippy was great I

47
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:03,859
think what fascinated me the most about

48
00:03:03,859 --> 00:03:05,690
the horizontal is the idea of using your

49
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:08,810
your life as a narrative for a daily

50
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:12,889
series now when I made my HBO series

51
00:03:12,889 --> 00:03:14,569
this is a series I did my big brother

52
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,760
van it was on HBO in 2010 we made it in

53
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,370
2008 that's 10 years ago my brother and

54
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:22,010
I used our lives as a backdrop for a TV

55
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:24,260
show but it wasn't so daily it wasn't so

56
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,910
episodic instead we kind of plucked

57
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,829
interestingness out of our lives

58
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:29,269
share that interestingness is tiny

59
00:03:29,269 --> 00:03:31,010
little stories struggle

60
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,019
stories together and call that a TV show

61
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:35,150
episode so I'm one end of the spectrum

62
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:37,420
we've got your daily vloggers in

63
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:40,159
2014-2015 sharing every aspect of their

64
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,019
daily lives into a camera and on the

65
00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:43,280
other end of the spectrum we got this TV

66
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,319
show that I made a decade ago where I

67
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:46,790
share our little stories from my lives

68
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:49,970
as short movies so I went to Belgium in

69
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:51,709
2015 this is a month before I started

70
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:53,659
vlogging and I wanted to test that one

71
00:03:53,659 --> 00:03:55,159
thing what would happen if I sort of

72
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:57,859
vlog about my trip but instead of

73
00:03:57,859 --> 00:03:59,629
talking into a camera I use really

74
00:03:59,629 --> 00:04:02,420
precise cinematography what would happen

75
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,069
movie like cinematography but it's just

76
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:05,959
me going about my daily life going into

77
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:07,190
my hotel room coming out of my hotel

78
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:09,620
room

79

80

[Music]

81
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,450
and I love that video that video work

82
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:21,010
you should watch it points below and

83
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,350
that got me super excited and that's

84
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,480
when I made the decision that on my

85
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,330
birthday 2015 I would start daily

86
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:30,520
vlogging it wouldn't be this all day

87
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,870
long and said I wanted to figure out how

88
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,100
to make something that felt a lot more

89
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,920
like a movie every day so that was the

90
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,120
thinking that's what went through my

91
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:43,060
head fire is starting to vlog so we're

92
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,070
not understanding here are the

93
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:48,640
foundational principles that I apply to

94
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,280
almost every episode of this daily

95
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,670
almost daily vlog number one the most

96
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,830
important thing is of course the story

97
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,830
but what is a story here's a super basic

98
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,570
breakdown of a story and every good

99
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:03,580
story follows this rule that is the rule

100
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,620
of a three-act narrative you've got a

101
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,510
beginning you've got a middle you've got

102
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:11,140
an end set up conflict resolution Jack

103
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,130
and Jill went up the hill to fetch a

104
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:14,380
pail of water act 1 Jack fell down and

105
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,690
broke his crown act 2 Jill came tumbling

106
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:20,440
after act 3 set up conflict resolution

107
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,870
now in some episodes that super super

108
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:25,030
super literal for example my all-time

109
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,220
favorite episode of ever made of this

110
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,020
vlog which is called my all-time

111
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:32,170
greatest is such a literal example of

112
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:34,630
set up conflict resolution it just felt

113
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,790
so good to make that there's a set up

114
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:38,560
here's what happened there's a conflict

115
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,450
oh my god what's the outcome going to be

116
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:42,340
and then there was a resolution happy

117
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:42,880
ending

118
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,890
that's not always so literal in every

119
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:46,720
episode but I strive for that in every

120
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,790
episode because that is what's at the

121
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:52,120
core of a well-told story and a story is

122
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,510
what drives any video like this and that

123
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,250
right there was sort of promise or the

124
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,500
deal that I made with myself was never

125
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,840
an obligation to share with you the

126
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,640
intimacy of every day of my life this

127
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,920
isn't a journal but instead could I find

128
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,630
everyday in my life

129
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:10,150
a three-act narrative to share now a

130
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:12,930
couple of the more granular aspects

131
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:18,030
I always found it kind of hard to watch

132
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:21,030
non-stop shaky camera vlogs

133
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:22,500
it was disorienting it was always a

134
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,199
little claustrophobic so so what I try

135
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,820
to do is have an equal amount of

136
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,370
handheld locked off shots locked off

137
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:31,590
means on a tripod like this and then

138
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:33,570
establishing shot the wide shot so it's

139
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:35,190
establishing shots let you know where I

140
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:37,410
am so it feels more like you're here

141
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:39,419
with me these locked off shots let you

142
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:41,100
the viewer forget about the camera for a

143
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,570
second and focus on what I'm saying in

144
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:44,550
the environment that I'm in and then the

145
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,680
handheld shots like this enable you to

146
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,509
sort of feel the spontaneity and the

147
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:50,610
urgency that is whatever is taking place

148
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:51,660
in my daily life

149
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,970
hardware is then what cameras i use I

150
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:55,530
have a simple rule for when it comes to

151
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:57,810
hardware and that is always use the very

152
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:00,210
best camera you have at your disposal so

153
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:01,889
right now I'm shooting this on my big

154
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:03,539
camera I'm shooting in 4k with a nice

155
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:05,250
wide lens this is a perfect shot I've

156
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,360
got a light right there I'm trying to

157
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,070
make myself look good this is the best I

158
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,720
have right now but when I'm out running

159
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,490
in the morning and I want to film my run

160
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:13,530
the best I have is my cell phone I keep

161
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:15,120
a point-and-shoot in my backpack in case

162
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,800
I don't have this big camera because the

163
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,000
point shoot is a little bit more dynamic

164
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,639
than just the cell phone so not to hold

165
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,770
into any certain kind of hardware or any

166
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:24,870
certain quality of hardware it's what I

167
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:27,300
have access to cinematography part to

168
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:31,110
hold the camera steady no one wants to

169
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:33,150
watch you forsake you cinematography it

170
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,889
hurts your brain it's hard to see what's

171
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:37,169
going on it's not pleasurable for you

172
00:07:37,169 --> 00:07:38,699
the viewer and it's not easy for me the

173
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:40,590
editor to put it together if it's super

174
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:42,419
shaky if it's nonsensical it's go

175
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:47,449
straight in the trash what's up Marlin

176
00:07:47,449 --> 00:07:50,430
almost off your pocket man I'm making a

177
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:52,620
movie Marlin about how to make how I

178
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:56,099
make my blog really yeah like it's not

179
00:07:56,099 --> 00:07:57,990
so much a tutorial but it's illusion of

180
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:00,120
light how do aspects of I've never

181
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,190
really shared right so you know what you

182
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,229
should have done usually suffered me and

183
00:08:04,229 --> 00:08:07,230
then taught you sit with me in

184
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:10,530
teach me all to do okay the next version

185
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:12,570
of Casey and I stats logging secrets

186
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:14,190
will be with Marlin we're in a peach and

187
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:16,140
out of law cinematography part three

188
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:19,440
time lapses and drones here's something

189
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,500
very important no one gives a about

190
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,440
your stupid time lapses your stupid

191
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,480
drone shots that's something I remind

192
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,850
myself in a daily basis that kind of

193
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:31,590
cinematography only works if it's

194
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:33,660
serving a greater purpose and for me it

195
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:36,330
serves two purposes one is transitional

196
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:37,919
so you'll notice sometimes like I'm

197
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,840
outside wrapping up a scene where I'm

198
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,610
doing something on my skateboard the

199
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:42,900
next scene I'm in my studio doing

200
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,400
something completely different and in

201
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,740
between there might be a beautiful drone

202
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,480
shot of the city or might be a beautiful

203
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,370
time-lapse of the city I'm using it to

204
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:52,530
get me from one scene or one aspect of

205
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:54,720
the story to the next as that it's an

206
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,820
incredibly effective tool the other

207
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,320
place where it works is to show the

208
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,050
audience a broader sort of a broader

209
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:03,570
image of where you are and what's taking

210
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:06,330
place in time drones in particular are

211
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:09,300
great for that I'm at a hotel on a cool

212
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,620
Beach and it doesn't really work

213
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,660
pointing my camera the drone can give

214
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,960
you context that otherwise couldn't

215
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,140
[Music]

216
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,420
[Applause]

217
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,590
it's that kind of ambitious beautiful

218
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:22,550
cinematography doesn't have a

219
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:24,500
relationship with the narrative even if

220
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,480
it's just a little relationship it feels

221
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,100
out of place and it gets boring very

222
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,670
very fast now there is a lot more depth

223
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:33,830
and complexity to it than that things

224
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:35,570
like where does being positive all the

225
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:37,700
time start to just sound like total BS

226
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,260
where people don't believe it things

227
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,640
like when I'm feeling down and I want to

228
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,600
share with you the audience I'm

229
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,070
struggling with something how do I do

230
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:44,510
that in a way that you actually care

231
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:46,040
because we've all got our own problems

232
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,170
why so think about yours it was like

233
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,210
consistent narratives and you know if

234
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:51,710
I'm on a trip that's five day long how

235
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:53,960
do I make a five day episode arced about

236
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,850
essentially the same subject there's a

237
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:57,170
lot of depth to this but I hope that

238
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:58,570
this serves the good sort of

239
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:00,740
introduction into some of the thinking

240
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:03,320
that I've had as I do this vlog I want

241
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,120
to end this first kind of instructional

242
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,880
sharing video by saying this probably

243
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,190
the most important thing succeeding

244
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:11,600
whether it's in the vlog in the YouTube

245
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,400
game or in the creative space at all is

246
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,580
this you have to have your own thing so

247
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,140
if you follow this video perfectly and

248
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:20,000
you make the most perfect kc blogs you

249
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,680
will have failed before you begun they

250
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,120
don't want to see your kc blog they want

251
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,640
to see your your vlogs they want to see

252
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,140
what you can bring to the table my

253
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,250
favorite thing in the world is seeing

254
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,110
how youtubers are able to iterate and

255
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:32,780
build on other youtubers styles and

256
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,940
sentiments and ideas until they make

257
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,920
something that's uniquely theirs those

258
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,170
are the youtubers that really succeed so

259
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:41,060
the most important rule is be original

260
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,830
and that whole recipe that I just

261
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:44,660
outlined that was what I thought I could

262
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:47,120
uniquely bring to YouTube and help find

263
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,700
success with it alright please let me

264
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,200
know below if this is super interesting

265

ah who's about to start the ocean is

299
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:58,410
really the last frontier surreal combat

300
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:03,000
did can't cannot really be articulated

301
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,490
in extraordinary efforts under direct

302
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:07,230
immediate danger to his own life

303
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:09,300
resulted in bidding for American lives

304
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,209
one host nation civilian and returning

305
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:13,920
for soldiers killed in action to their

306
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,280
families

307
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:25,330
[Applause]

308
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:29,440
movie was about taking former soldiers

309
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,960
bringing them to help repair coral reefs

310
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,510
I like scuba diving and that being

311
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:38,270
therapy for the soldiers and then also a

312
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:42,230
way to start to repair the damaged

313
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:44,030
environment so it's like helping the

314
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:46,150
earth and helping the former soldiers

315
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:50,330
