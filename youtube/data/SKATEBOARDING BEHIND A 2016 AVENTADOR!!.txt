No

56
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:12,409
it's like super duper hot out here and asked Josh if there's a way we could go

57
00:06:12,409 --> 00:06:15,409
swimming or something so

58
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:34,110
it's like swimming in a bowl of it's like swimming a gigantic cappuccino in

59
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,490
the water is so high

60
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:39,270
how was like it's getting boy on my scooter you're not expecting right now

61
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:43,470
I'm not gonna get some refreshing water like like feet

62
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:53,850
this is the instructor here he has a unique style of flyboarding really likes

63
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:58,110
to form out there you can see him blowing kisses to the camera

64
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:06,410
break from the action for lunch

65
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,940
I think we're in your skate boarding now

66
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:15,449
yeah

67
00:07:15,449 --> 00:07:20,069
yeah

68
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:38,140
I realized I hadn't given much context exactly what's going on and Dubai today

69
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:43,240
mainly because I didn't have any context i call the rush yesterday and was like

70
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,380
I'm coming to dubai for like a couple of hours tomorrow and when I showed this

71
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:50,620
morning is like I've got a great day planned for us and yeah just been

72
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:56,140
realizing all these crazy ideas they put so much effort them I just I just don't

73
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:59,290
think it's fair to say Russia I don't want to drive behind a Lamborghini on a

74
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:02,260
skateboard while attached to the gigantic red rope across a bridge that

75
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,500
we're not supposed to be on

76
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:09,009
yeah

77
00:08:09,009 --> 00:08:13,389

81
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:33,380

82
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:38,089
information how he hasn't called the police yet he's just private security

83
00:08:38,089 --> 00:08:43,190
arash doing a very good job of speaking to him respectfully and politely lightly

84
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:47,330
with the hopes that he will I hope he just lets us go

85
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:55,240
yeah

86
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,390
follow us

87
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:03,820
I don't know I thought you were dealing with him really politely and appropriate

88
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,060
