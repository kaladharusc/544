1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:10,110
Marvel Studios vines for the most

2
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,059
obnoxious logo Oscar and I hate to tell

3
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:13,320
you this Marvel but you're going to get

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,299
beat by bloom house in case you confused

5
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:17,760
it with Missouri Jupiter holy 1980 Kurt

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,260
Russell effects are pretty amazing took

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,820
me at least 20 seconds to figure out I

8
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,980
wasn't watching used cars but sin for

9
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,029
making me think I was watching you as

10
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:26,010
cars Dairy Queen product placement is so

11
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,449
ridiculous and obvious it should be in

12
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:27,990
Wayne's World

13
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:29,250
I guess these letters and numbers are

14
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,840
some sort of coordinates but just like

15
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,940
latitude and longitude I don't need also

16
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,829
how in the name of math could this many

17
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:36,180
planets be clustered up together like

18
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,070
this as if to remind us that Peter quill

19
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:39,930
is from 1980s earth Peter uses an

20
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:41,460
electronic football game machine as a

21
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,050
portable radar of some sort two

22
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,640
questions how did Peter take so many

23
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,899
items with him when he got abducted in

24
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:48,180
1988 and why the fuck would he need to

25
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,860
hack into this electronic football game

26
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,379
to create a radar mmm I can't be mad at

27
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:53,129
this movie now

28
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:55,140
welcome cute Groot is this opening dance

29
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,699
but all the mayhem going on around it is

30
00:00:56,699 --> 00:00:57,239
so fun

31
00:00:57,239 --> 00:00:58,230
Emmett you put me in a good mood

32
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,539
guardians of the galaxy 2 but also group

33
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:02,010
will later prove to be super helpful in

34
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:03,870
battle even while tiny so this opening

35
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:05,070
scene just makes him look like a selfish

36
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:09,150
dick by the way all the characters

37
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,619
fighting this alien survives stuff like

38
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:12,180
this in the middle of this fight rocket

39
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,890
sees baby Groot almost eat an insect and

40
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:15,390
decides to tear himself away from the

41
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:16,950
way more important action to stop him

42
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:19,430
and how did he even see that bug anyway

43
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:22,950
me isn't Drax just like a big dude with

44
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,080
no special powers how the does he jump

45
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,090
this high and far also in this hero

46
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:28,500
purposely gets swallowed by a monster

47
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,090
cliche I'm gonna wonder why don't the

48
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,450
monsters stomach acids kill these people

49
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:34,950
and what caused this cut on the monsters

50
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,990
impenetrable skin video game designer

51
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,360
also if the aliens skin is tough why

52
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,799
does a sword suddenly slice through him

53
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,479
even with the cut it's not like the skin

54
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,040
underneath the cut is suddenly weak

55
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,170
because the cut exists we could not risk

56
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:49,159
the lives of our own sovereign citizens

57
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:51,899
every citizen is born exactly as

58
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:53,700
designed by the community

59
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,259
she just went from regular dialogue to

60
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:57,180
expositional nonsense but no warning I

61
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,439
see it within you an unorthodox

62
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:03,060
genealogy guardians are hired by a race

63
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,710
of people that can read into his lineage

64
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,540
just by looking at him a topic that just

65
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,860
so happens to be extremely important to

66
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,720
the story now that they not lost his ass

67
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,400
at this point even by accident that's

68
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,349
funny we can make Kurt Russell look 29

69
00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:13,830
but we can

70
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,420
make a space confrontation look unlike

71
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,160
Titan II our heroes are now being

72
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,690
attacked by the sovereign who hired them

73
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:20,130
for that job they just completed all

74
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,810
because Rockets stole something and my

75
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,520
point is that none of this matters this

76
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,840
is all just noise until we get to the

77
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,250
Kurt Russell stuff this could literally

78
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,840
beat any attacking fleet right now it

79
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,790
wouldn't matter it could be the Klingons

80
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,080
and most of us wouldn't even bat an eye

81
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,540
space battle yay I'm not killing anyone

82
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,010
all those ships are remotely piloted

83
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:36,990
wait a minute didn't they hire the

84
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,460
guardians to kill the space monster we

85
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,050
saw in the opening credits and didn't

86
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:41,910
the High Priestess say we could not risk

87
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,490
the lives of our own so how would they

88
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:45,600
have risked the lives of their own

89
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,100
citizens if they use remotely piloted

90
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,830
ships we hired them and they steal from

91
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:52,650
us that is heresy of the highest order

92
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,810
technically speaking heresy is a belief

93
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:56,459
or opinion contrary to Orthodox

94
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:58,140
religious especially Christian doctrine

95
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,520
basic stealing doesn't seem to be

96
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,570
covered here can't you just call it

97
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:05,190
theft they've been doing a firing with

98
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:07,110
the intent to miss to make it do that

99
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,550
you'd have to be the greatest pilot in

100
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:09,750
the universe taking a look at this

101
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,760
asteroid field you'd also need extensive

102
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,380
Battletoads experience find a luck

103
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,000
dragon and watch The Empire Strikes Back

104
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,800
asteroid field sequence more than 50

105
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,600
times for pointers and you'd still die

106
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,800
from this we're about to die and this is

107
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,390
what we're discussing Gamora would be

108
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,640
amazing it cinemasins also how is this

109
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,989
ship configured where two people can

110
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:30,650
pilot the goddamn thing at the same time

111
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,730
there are still hundreds of ships ready

112
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:34,470
to shoot down the Milano how come

113
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,420
everybody was crowded around I lack a

114
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,769
minute ago as if he was their last

115
00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:39,750
chance to shoot it down also look at

116
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,880
this great how is the ship not freaking

117
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,330
go exploded literal day of sex machina I

118
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,040
know Gamora as a badass and I have no

119
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,690
question of her skills but there is no

120
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:50,190
kin waiting she's holding onto the spool

121
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,959
and heavy as Drax while the ship crashes

122
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:53,880
once again the Starship Enterprise crash

123
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,380
lands through a bunch of trees and oh

124
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,940
you're telling me this isn't the

125
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,010
Starship Enterprise but a ripoff of all

126
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:00,510
the Starship Enterprise crashes that

127
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:02,250
have occurred in all 48 movies okay

128
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,290
still a sip Drax comically slams into

129
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,239
trees and doesn't comically die we

130
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,769
almost died because of your arrogance

131
00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:10,230
more like because he stoled annual axe

132
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:11,640
batteries I can't believe I'm saying

133
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,470
this but I'm 100% with Peter quill on

134
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:16,109
this one after all these years I've

135
00:04:16,109 --> 00:04:18,540
found you and just in time to save the

136
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,950
day - what are the odds

137
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,780
here's that Biff Tannen from Back to the

138
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,729
Future to join forces with Joker from

139
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:25,260
The Killing Joke to create a city for

140
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,180
this movie Guardians series continues to

141
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:27,630
push how

142
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,280
the duck at us without an apology hey

143
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,410
you're out of luck until you've gone

144
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:33,450
done you're lonely now until you've gone

145
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,280
cow you're stuck here until you've gone

146
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,380
full dear you're a masturbator until you

147
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,390
go Gator hey marvel do you not have

148
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,410
enough characters in these things

149
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,060
Avengers infinity war already has

150
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,830
infinity actors in it it promises to be

151
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,840
the no man's sky a boo bees in 15 years

152
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,640
we buying tickets to save Chris Evans

153
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,110
because he's stuck in a deleted scene

154
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:51,240
multiverse Ender's Game technology will

155
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,500
be added to the reclining seats at your

156
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:57,540
local movie theater I mean Jesus I think

157
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,920
it's pretty hilarious that this group

158
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,410
race Club of Ravagers has a super strict

159
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:03,720
moral code I also find the horns of

160
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,490
freedom to be hilarious but most

161
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:07,140
hilarious is this obvious foreshadowing

162
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,960
of yondu's death you blew all our hearts

163
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,730
guardians of the godfather' two

164
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:13,620
sovereigns decide to travel all the way

165
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,180
to a remote planet to propose a deal

166
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,470
with the on do when I'm pretty sure a

167
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,060
king phone call of some sort would do

168
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:18,390
the trick

169
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,890
do they have phone technology in space

170
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:21,450
do they have to travel everywhere then

171
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:22,710
to get to this whole time you thought

172
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:25,530
yondu was my actual blood relative you

173
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:29,070
look exactly alike oh man everyone in

174
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,240
this movie would be excellent at cinema

175
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:39,720
sense somehow against all odds the

176
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,850
former WWE personality has become the

177
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:43,500
best thing about these movies it's a kid

178
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,090
I used to see all the other kids off

179
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:47,400
playing catch with their dad in the

180
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,690
first movie Peter quill have mommy

181
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:50,220
issues and the sequel he's got daddy

182
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,990
issues in the third one it'll be trouble

183
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:53,730
with the inlaws time basically meet the

184
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:56,250
parents in space it's my point Peter

185
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:59,400
what if this man is your Hasselhoff

186
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,930
this asshole shows up and says he's

187
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:02,550
quills dad quill is immediately

188
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:04,470
suspicious but the usually guarded and

189
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:05,940
skeptical Gamora is gonna pull

190
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,380
heartstrings and talk quill into

191
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,090
believing if anything based on the last

192
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:10,710
movie quill should be stupidly ready for

193
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:12,420
puppy love with his new daddy and Gamora

194
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,500
should be the one trying to talk some

195
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,180
sceptical sense into him is this spray

196
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,680
thing actually repairing a kingship

197
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,810
magic metal and complex mechanics at

198
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:20,360
your fingertips

199
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,830
I think if under oath even James Gunn

200
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,210
would admit the scene is only here

201
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:27,650
because he desperately wanted a slow

202
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:29,270
motion cool walk sequence and this was

203
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,349
the best place he could find to put it

204
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:32,030
certainly the TEL rocket what a Dickey

205
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,590
his moment just before this does nothing

206
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:35,330
to lead into a cool slow-mo walk scene

207
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:37,310
after 20 plus years quill somehow still

208
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,840
has the David Hasselhoff picture that

209
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,250
was just mentioned one scene ago this

210
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,990
probably isn't as impossible as the

211
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:43,430
Walkman that still works but it's pretty

212
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:46,099
darn improbable I can also alter

213
00:06:46,099 --> 00:06:49,340
emotions to some extent yeah like what

214
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,680
like say a screenwriter needs something

215
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,879
to happen in their movie and they run

216
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:54,740
into a won't they invent my character to

217
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:55,969
solve the problem which will involve

218
00:06:55,969 --> 00:06:57,919
someone's emotions stuff like that how

219
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,569
in the name of math could all these why

220
00:06:59,569 --> 00:07:01,099
is this movie so obsessed with cramming

221
00:07:01,099 --> 00:07:02,810
up teen heavenly bodies into every space

222
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:04,879
shot I mean granted these booby traps

223
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:06,680
end up being useful but exactly how much

224
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,180
ship repair time did rocket waste

225
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:10,039
setting all that up there was that much

226
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:11,419
work to do why did I leave only rocket

227
00:07:11,419 --> 00:07:13,539
and baby Groot

228
00:07:13,539 --> 00:07:15,590
if rocket was smart enough to set up

229
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:17,300
booby traps for the Ravagers why is he

230
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,159
in any position to get seen or shot

231
00:07:19,159 --> 00:07:21,259
during the sequence I put a tracer on

232
00:07:21,259 --> 00:07:23,000
your ship back there during the war over

233
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,490
Zen yeah figures space tech allows for

234
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:27,710
easy tracers but not tracer detectors we

235
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:29,750
ain't stupid enough to help kill the

236
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,819
guardians of the galaxy this feels like

237
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:33,080
something that could have been discussed

238
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,879
a lot earlier if Yan day was so sure his

239
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:36,169
crew would accept the quarter-million

240
00:07:36,169 --> 00:07:37,430
for the batteries then why didn't you

241
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:42,949
just say so from the very beginning no

242
00:07:42,949 --> 00:07:44,240
one will be seated during the Yellow

243
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,339
Submarine portion of the movie it was

244
00:07:46,339 --> 00:07:49,580
with Meredith that I first experienced

245
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,860
love I have so many questions about this

246
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:54,589
3d display that aids egos story like is

247
00:07:54,589 --> 00:07:56,060
this a simulation by a computer

248
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:58,099
is it egos thoughts either way you slice

249
00:07:58,099 --> 00:07:59,449
it why did the characters look like wax

250
00:07:59,449 --> 00:08:01,099
models I like this better than Holograms

251
00:08:01,099 --> 00:08:02,990
for sure but seems like ego could do

252
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,939
better than this and when I heard of a

253
00:08:04,939 --> 00:08:06,949
man from Earth who held an infinity

254
00:08:06,949 --> 00:08:09,620
stone in his head without dying I knew

255
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:12,080
you must be the son of the woman I loved

256
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,120
so why did it take until just before

257
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,889
quill got shot down by the sovereign for

258
00:08:15,889 --> 00:08:16,520
you to find it

259
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,500
also ego completely glosses over the

260
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,819
teamwork portion of the first movies

261
00:08:19,819 --> 00:08:21,620
Infinity stones survival scene it takes

262
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,539
a long-ass time for this guy to die in

263
00:08:23,539 --> 00:08:25,490
space and pretty sure everyone from dr.

264
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:27,229
Neil deGrasse Tyson to Tim Robbins in

265
00:08:27,229 --> 00:08:28,669
mission to Mars would tell you his death

266
00:08:28,669 --> 00:08:30,630
would be near instantaneous I know

267
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:32,550
mark is an old man without his magic

268
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:35,160
stick we're talking woodland beasts give

269
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,200
me nebula one on one or even one on five

270
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,660
of these guys but she is surrounded the

271
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:40,890
hell are they waiting for doesn't she

272
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:42,720
have a bounty on her head to look if

273
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,130
everything Ellen ego's planet is going

274
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:45,630
to be plastic and wax looking you might

275
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,640
as well take me to Madame Tussaud tout

276
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,190
just you know the wax museum that I'm

277
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:51,810
thinking of 42nd Street in Manhattan

278
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:53,880
next to the AMC Empire and McDonald's

279
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,040
that thing mother told everyone my

280
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,960
father was from the stars it's like that

281
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,150
movie star ma'am it was a John Carpenter

282
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,950
film who worked a ton with Kurt Russell

283
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:03,630
back in the day but he put Jeff Bridges

284
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:04,410
in the movie instead

285
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:05,760
I guess Kurt Russell finally got the

286
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,410
place Norman take your brain in the

287
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:09,210
center of this planet Peter quill

288
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:11,430
doesn't respond with what and gets the

289
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:12,360
stun on the first try

290
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,040
which is a sin but thank God because

291
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,510
this movie still has over an hour left

292
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:17,430
and just like that movie has given Peter

293
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:19,140
quill his long sought-after catch with

294
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,700
dad moment it's just instead of a

295
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,930
baseball they're using the soul of a

296
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,520
planet filled the dreams eat your heart

297
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,220
out something I must tell you tomorrow's

298
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,360
opening a door will prevent me from

299
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,770
telling you this very important thing

300
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:30,750
until it's too late he offered me a

301
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,760
place with the Ravagers said all I

302
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:37,020
needed to do in like a professional

303
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:40,140
asshole movie speaks directly to me and

304
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,390
gets it 100% right Groot who previously

305
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:43,950
was in a cage before the Ravagers

306
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,180
started beating him up and throwing

307
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,620
alcohol on him is allowed to walk around

308
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,090
the ship because everybody got super

309
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:49,770
drunk I guess and luckily he Charlie

310
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:51,300
Brown walks to the exact area of the

311
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,860
ship where rocket and yondu are quick

312
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,780
sidenote but why do these Ravagers all

313
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:55,410
sleep together

314
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:58,080
also why was no one put on watch this

315
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,640
little dream on the core duty overnight

316
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,380
Groot cuts off some dudes toe without

317
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,030
him feeling it I guess when Ravagers

318
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,800
drink they drink the top she'll blackout

319
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,150
stuff that allows you to lose limbs

320
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:09,360
without painting he hates heads on

321
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,250
anyone not just himself maybe this is

322
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,810
part of the joke but if rocket can

323
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:14,640
understand group like this and group can

324
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,530
understand rocket how's he not getting

325
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:19,800
the message about yondu's fit directors

326
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,750
brother ex machina gotta admit this

327
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,100
yondu arrow scene is pretty awesome

328
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,140
funny and entertaining good stuff

329
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,150
worthless in office baby Groot kicks ass

330
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,470
here despite having gone the entire

331
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,480
movie not kicking any ass why is there

332
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,610
any tension in this goddamn movie Jesus

333
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:34,230
there's a lightsaber cross with a

334
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,330
Patronus charm meets limbus Bret somehow

335
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:38,010
yondu miss teaser face during his

336
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:39,240
whistling spree despite the fact that

337
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,380
he's killed more people than was

338
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,970
originally shown on the ship this piece

339
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:43,530
of the ship doesn't explode because I

340
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:51,570
guess the movie told

341
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:54,100
so you guys should totally die doing

342
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,930
this right it should do way more to you

343
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:57,820
than comic face distortion right is

344
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:00,580
Groot man million dancing Christ this

345
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,020
movie runs in place while Peter in the

346
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:04,000
gang or on the ego planet sure there are

347
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,200
some fun moments here and there but I

348
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,550
just end up remembering the Avengers

349
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:07,960
going to hawkeye's farm and age of

350
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,500
Ultron

351
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,630
I finally found my family don't you

352
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,580
understand that she should since she's

353
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,840
the one that pushed you to come here

354
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,000
before suddenly doing a 180 prometheus

355
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,620
school of god dammit if she just run

356
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,910
towards the ship she'd have eliminated

357
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:21,130
about 80% of the bullet danger just Sam

358
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:23,470
is the ship's aiming computer faulty or

359
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:25,240
she just really good at running is this

360
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,770
ship seriously running into rocks and

361
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,330
still moving we were just trying to kill

362
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:29,470
each other but now I'm going to save you

363
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:31,500
so our characters can reconcile cliche

364
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,700
look we're in a movie that is a little

365
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,500
bit more comedic than usual but I'm

366
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,360
about to give when it comes to how many

367
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,070
things these people survived this isn't

368
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:40,690
even an attempted humor it's just people

369
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:42,580
surviving an impossible explosion not

370
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,830
tell me what I want I don't need to tell

371
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:46,960
you what you wanted skip just once I'd

372
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,040
like to see this asshole change the

373
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,330
batteries in this thing or show what

374
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:51,040
kind of mr. fusion contraption he has up

375
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,890
in this mug to keep it running brandy

376
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:57,240
you're a fine girl what a good wife

377
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,100
Jesus Christ can we move the plot now

378
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,930
you played catch with him 25 minutes ago

379
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,580
can we get to the fucking point I don't

380
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,960
know if I've ever been simultaneously

381
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,280
entertained and bored at the same time

382
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,220
in one movie come with me oh she knows

383
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,810
something it makes me worry about stuff

384
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:15,370
and things the whole Drax finds mantis

385
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:16,930
disgusting thing was funny the first

386
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:18,340
couple times now or just wasting more

387
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,930
time why did the movie spend so long

388
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:20,980
trying to make it seem like Kurt Russell

389
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,540
was the good guy all the stuff with

390
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,950
yondu was more than enough to tell you

391
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,420
that ego was not the father Peter was

392
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,910
looking for at that time I was a Federal

393
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,950
Express man Stan Lee cameo tries to

394
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,630
retroactively Lee justify all Stan Lee

395
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:33,550
cameos as The Watcher which only makes

396
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,140
all Stan Lee cameos that much more

397
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:42,040
annoying because you're me I'm lying

398
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,390
this movie could work on so many daddy

399
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,920
issues over this weird celestial

400
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,720
tapestry fathers leave no need to be a

401
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,820
pussy now one of them carried the

402
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,250
celestial genes

403
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,560
until you Peter Allen a thousands of

404
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,120
women he successfully got pregnant Peter

405
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,800
was the only one I might be talking out

406
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,390
of my ass here but wouldn't a celestial

407
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:59,520
gene be a dominant trait can someone do

408
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,600
a Punnett square and get back to me

409
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,580
you're right we're family

410
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,140
Drax binge watch The Fast and Furious

411
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:06,570
movies prior to this mission it broke my

412
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:09,150
heart to put that tumor in ER why hey

413
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:14,520
would you say this every motherfucking

414
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,260
one of these mother Chris that's mom who

415
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,240
not only dies tragically it drives them

416
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,770
the Winter Soldier killed my mom Martha

417
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:28,110
why did you say Martha I tried

418
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,580
boobies gag of casting the real

419
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,350
Hasselhoff after all that talk of Peter

420
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:32,790
loving Hasselhoff just ends up pulling

421
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:34,650
me out of the movie which was already so

422
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:35,820
ludicrous is to be skating on thin

423
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,770
suspension of disbelief ice to begin

424
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:38,190
with

425
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:41,640
this is the scene knowing Kurt Russell

426
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,690
he just smashed the most priceless

427
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:47,940
Walkman known to man in the shop the

428
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:54,030
spaceship has boat steering wheels okay

429
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,650
so how did you find out about the other

430
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:57,660
kids you know what never mind I think

431
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,920
the real issue here is how lucky Peter

432
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,540
was to have literally thousands of other

433
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,980
kids get kidnapped before him so that

434
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,240
yondu could finally figure out that

435
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,810
those other kids were getting killed

436
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:08,730
okay before taser face died he sent the

437
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:10,290
sovereign the coordinates for yondu ship

438
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:12,360
coordinates that could only send them to

439
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,920
where the explosion happened after that

440
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,420
rocket punched him the coordinates for

441
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,580
the ego planet a planet that took 700

442
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,870
jumps from those original coordinates

443
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,040
sovereign could have put their best

444
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,780
trackers and bluetick coonhound on the

445
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:22,860
trail and they would have never found

446
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,570
where yondu ship went in literally a

447
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:26,310
million years you'll be asked how many

448
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:27,810
sudden ships do we need to show before

449
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:29,490
it becomes overkill then answered that

450
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:30,960
question with three times more than you

451
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,370
think this is the problem with the

452
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:33,780
sovereign still lingering around in this

453
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,550
movie all for some batteries with almost

454
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,170
no explanation of their importance they

455
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:38,280
bogged down a finale that could have

456
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,390
been pretty simple and turn it into

457
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:40,980
Jupiter ascending levels of noise and

458
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,960
CGI battles thrilling climactic scene

459
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,850
but why does human Peter quill need a

460
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,770
space masks but raccoon rocket does not

461
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:51,280
is there air you don't know

462
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,540
Ruby cuts away from this panel because

463
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:57,860
even it knows how useless it is so later

464
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,450
we find out nobody has any tape to mark

465
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:00,740
the button group isn't supposed to press

466
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,810
but couldn't a lot of things mark this

467
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:05,480
button a magic marker a felt pen a magic

468
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,190
marker this is a second time this movie

469
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:08,840
has tried to ring laughs entertainment

470
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,310
out of showing us characters near the

471
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:11,900
battle and fudging the actual battle in

472
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,370
the background this will be the second

473
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,990
time the sovereign has one tiny ship

474
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:16,400
surrounded shoots a million photon

475
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,930
torpedoes at it and somehow fails to

476
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:19,970
bring it down meanwhile all their ships

477
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:21,470
get destroyed by a literal ex machina

478
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:23,330
the only thing missing from this shot is

479
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:25,100
Scarlett Johansson cocking a gun damn

480
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,260
does yondu's arrow ever suffer from wear

481
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,750
and tear cuz that thing may not up it

482
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,930
says here Jakob is that Ana mantium and

483
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:34,850
vibranium rocket throws some round

484
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,620
things that cling to egos tentacles and

485
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,240
the tentacles are ready to crush rocket

486
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,010
but then a force field happens because

487
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:41,360
that's something rocket has all of a

488
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,740
sudden and I have no idea what just

489
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,410
happened you saw it I saw it the moron

490
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:47,330
nebula crashed headfirst into a rock and

491
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:51,410
they're gonna live what's that he says

492
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:53,990
welcome to the frickin guardians of the

493
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:56,120
galaxy and yet telling him what button

494
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,680
not the press is still a fucking ordeal

495
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,630
okay I seriously can't believe this

496
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:00,980
movie comes down to a fistfight between

497
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:03,230
a human and a planet does the movie not

498
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:05,510
know how a pixel says this also you have

499
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,640
two gods turning into huge rock monsters

500
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,350
and that's the result they crash into

501
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:10,550
each other and we're back to where we

502
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:14,780
started for fuck's sake I mean yondu is

503
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,220
mostly redeemed here in the sequel

504
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:18,050
through sheer screen right but let's be

505
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:19,460
honest he's still a dick and Peter

506
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,870
barely had any time to bond with him as

507
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,610
anything other than a slave owner also

508
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:25,280
no I sent word the yonder's old ravage

509
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,770
of buddies told them what he did I don't

510
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:28,760
know these guys were pretty adamant

511
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,650
about yondu breaking the code do they

512
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:32,150
really think one sacrifice cleans up its

513
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:34,130
record and they just believed a rascally

514
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:36,080
raccoon when he told him a story I can't

515
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,130
believe this movie's over and they

516
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:38,570
didn't even put tango and cash in a

517
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:41,270
scene together sweet another contraption

comic book fans scream their genes they

520
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:45,410

521
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:46,610
credits scenes into a YouTube channel
