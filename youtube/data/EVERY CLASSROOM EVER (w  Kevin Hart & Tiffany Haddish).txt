semester no that's just for today

21
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:58,190
every classroom ever okay tonight's

22
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:01,460
night school lesson is sex ed but due to

23
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:04,160
budget cuts we have a pre-recorded video

24
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,650
featuring Tiffany Haddish and Kevin Hart

25
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,230
enjoy how you doing I'm Kevin Hart and

26
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:11,390
I'm Tiffany Haddish and we're going to

27
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:14,240
teach you sex ed that's right some

28
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,500
people might think it's weird and

29
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,910
embarrassing would be teaching a room

30
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,970
full of adult sex ed it's that I say yes

31
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:24,310
it is

32
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:27,290
but let's keep it real it's probably

33
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:29,060
pointless to be teaching you about sex

34
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,760
ed at this point it's very true to be

35
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,900
honest I feel like we should start with

36
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:42,860
hygiene you ever had sex about now thank

37
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:45,170
