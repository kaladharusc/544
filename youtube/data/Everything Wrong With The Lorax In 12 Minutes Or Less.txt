Ted Ted might have the creepiest stalker

21
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:54,790
tactic in the history of film this is a

22
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:56,710
children's film I remind you considering

23
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:57,610
this building is taller than the

24
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:58,960
surrounding houses Ted should have been

25
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,070
able to see this from the front of

26
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:03,580
Audrey's house those are trees real ones

27
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,290
how does she know this and even if she

28
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:07,000
does she admits she's never seen one so

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,440
how is she able to paint them with this

30
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,509
much detailed accuracy had me smelled

31
00:01:10,509 --> 00:01:12,940
like butterfly milk Wow

32
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,220
what does that even mean horny Ted would

33
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:16,300
be excellent at cinemasins

34
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,660
a guy somehow got you one well I

35
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:22,390
probably marry him on the spot I bet

36
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:24,610
that sounds crazy is that so crazy not

to future serial stalker possible killer

38
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:32,050
Ted I get this is supposed to be funny

39
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,580
but from a marketing standpoint it makes

40
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,110
zero sense why this company would put a

41
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:37,000
disco setting in their product over say

42
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
top 40s pop setting my disco also how

43
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,930
does the tree make the lights go off

44
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:42,369
inside the house if you're going to

45
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:43,869
leave this button unsecured and easy to

46
00:01:43,869 --> 00:01:45,820
activate why install a stair mechanism

47
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,619
in the first place just build stairs or

48
00:01:47,619 --> 00:01:48,970
I don't know a door at ground level

49
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:50,829
having the first stair located chest

50
00:01:50,829 --> 00:01:52,299
level directly under the activation

51
00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:53,650
button is not only the most dangerous

52
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:55,420
option but also to I off the ground to

53
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,670
be easily accessed the more smog in the

54
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:01,119
sky the more people will buy if O'Hare

55
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:02,500
is just coming to this realization I'm

56
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,820
having a hard time figuring out how he

57
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,890
made his zillions why is he leaving town

58
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:08,769
no one ever leaves then maybe you should

59
00:02:08,769 --> 00:02:09,759
make it a little harder for the people

60
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,590
to get out maybe you have a passcode or

61
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,180
handprint sensor instead of just a big

62
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,760
button to open the door if the air this

63
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,470
close is so bad how does it not impact

64
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,000
neat Vil I didn't see any kind of dome

65
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,709
what separates the good air from the bat

66
00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:22,570
how did he even find this place was

67
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:23,680
there only one road that led directly

68
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,079
here I don't know about trees what

69
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:28,150
happened wasn't keeping him on the hook

70
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,530
up by the window have been easier for

71
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:31,420
carrying on a conversation how could Ted

72
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:34,019
even hear him from down on the ground I

73
00:02:34,019 --> 00:02:36,880
was a young man narrated story within a

74
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,620
narrated story welcome to near ception

75
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:41,290
if somehow your invention ends up a

76
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:44,680
failure instead of a success oh it

77
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,020
wouldn't surprise me at all mom Chloe

78
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:51,470
the magical self amplified electric

79
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,910
guitar is magical what kind of bad

80
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,140
compression are they using down in the

81
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,160
marshmallow factory to make this

82
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,960
marshmallow money shot happen oh yes

83
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,820
right after the musical number about the

84
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,250
kid who kept interrupting the story and

85
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,990
was never heard from again he just

86
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:04,310
threatened Ted with murder is this

87
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,660
setting up a horror sequel maybe a

88
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,220
collaboration between Seuss and Stephen

89
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,020
King can we call it needful things see

90
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,610
once-ler apparently has the strength of

91
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:12,260
10 men in that skinny hipster body

92
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,540
little did I know that by jumping down

93
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:18,230
that tree I had just summoned a mystical

94
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:20,660
creature as old as time itself

95
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,100
known as the beat you over the head with

96
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,450
an environmental message creature where

97
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:25,400
did Ted's insta house come from his cart

98
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,960
seems like more material than he would

99
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,580
have had but fine let's say it was in

100
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,350
his cart how did he build it so fast and

101
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:32,390
all by himself so you're telling me you

102
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:34,220
just didn't see me magically appear out

103
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,320
of that stump with all the lightning and

104
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,570
thunder and stuff see any of that The

105
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:39,590
Lorax has a good point

106
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,120
even if Ted didn't see him pop out of

107
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,590
the trunk he had to notice the lightning

108
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,000
and thunder along with the dark clouds

109
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,020
that randomly appeared and disappeared

110
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,360
if you want to hear more come back

111
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,710
tomorrow there is literally no reason

112
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,630
for Sir once-ler lot to delay finishing

113
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,310
this TED talk other than the movie wants

114
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,660
to movie a little bit more before he

115
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,220
finishes I know this is a dream sequence

116
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,900
and everything but how did she blow out

117
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,100
the candles on the other side of that

118
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,900
cake wow that's some expert level

119
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,520
daydreaming right there you're so into

120
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,630
it you're forgetting you're holding a

121
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:04,100
box of cereal with mom and grandma at

122
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,900
the table I'm not sure how this Susie

123
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,700
and Scrabble works with no points listed

124
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,200
on the tiles and a playing board that's

125
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,640
way too small but I do know that gramma

126
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,170
so just completely vanished into thin

127
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:13,940
air okay it was already obvious that

128
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,440
neat Ville has no building safety

129
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,910
standards but these skinny stairs

130
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:18,320
without a guardrail just gave me

131
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,030
secondhand vertigo and not the good

132
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:22,400
Jimmy Stewart kind so all O'Hare did was

133
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,050
tell Ted he shouldn't leave the town

134
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,310
again he didn't think to post guards at

135
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,660
the exit door or anything that would be

136
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,550
useful in deterring the situation not

137
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,050
sure why Ted is surprised here this is

138
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:31,310
exactly what happened the last time he

139
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,630
rang the doorbell why don't you like

140
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,730
other kids breakdancing him wearing

141
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:37,060
bell-bottoms and playing the Donkey Kong

142
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,560
stalky Kong does this mean this is in

143
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,060
our universe and not a fantasy world

144
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,320
I've been forgiving a lot of silliness

145
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,940
thinking this some other fantasy world

146
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,950
but if you know Donkey Kong you should

147
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,600
also understand aerodynamic vehicles

148
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,490
fish not being able to breathe or sing

149
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,590
out of water and trees having leaves and

150
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:52,430
not cotton candy

151
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:54,230
here's 10 retroactive sins for all those

152
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,970
times I like your nonsense go how nice

153
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:58,280
to see someone so undeterred by things

154
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,190
like reality oh there pot I mean kettle

155
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:01,730
maybe go

156
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:03,500
Lim thinkin he can find a tree for his

157
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,420
crush but speaking of reality how do you

158
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,190
even live here there's no vegetation no

159
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,720
source of clean water your entire

160
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,670
existence is undeterred by things like

161
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:12,950
reality Firefly fish food falsely

162
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,840
fashions fake fish light flashlights

163
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,040
let's look past the fact that the

164
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,690
once-ler had some kind of portable house

165
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:18,860
in the back of his carriage

166
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,870
how does he have electricity who taught

167
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,610
you guys how to steal a bag who taught

168
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:26,690
them what a bed was Mission Impossible

169
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:29,120
theme during a secret job cliche also

170
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,260
fishing impossible

171
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,000
these bar-ba-loots going all Fisher

172
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,680
friends not food certainly makes sense

173
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,030
in a kids movie but we all know that

174
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,710
these discount Bears would have devoured

175
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,570
every one of these harmonious halibuts

176
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:40,070
in the real world right I know there's

177
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,600
some wood on that bed frame but I'm

178
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,100
still guessing the iron frame and

179
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,960
overall weight make this buoyant bedtime

180
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,670
business a bust now you're concerned for

181
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:48,500
his life if baby bar balut hadn't been

182
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,760
on that bed he probably would have just

183
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,470
gone chasing waterfalls without you and

184
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:53,090
died anyway the second you send a

185
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:54,380
sleeping man down a river you should

186
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,400
have already made your peace with him

187
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,570
sleeping where the humming fishes huh

188
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:58,430
the once-ler is suddenly dry even though

189
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,870
he was submerged in the river less than

190
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:04,010
a minute ago no a movie you do not have

191
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:05,540
my permission to continue to use these

192
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,280
creepy fin legged chipmunk sounding

193
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,080
human tooth having fish is a constant

194
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,610
sound effects machine enough is enough

195
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:12,050
apparently this fridge is powered by the

196
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:13,700
same magic electricity as Ted's guitar

197
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:17,300
but FFL but wait there's more thanks to

198
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,310
its all-natural microfibers the feed is

199
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:22,550
super absorbent it also works that so

200
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,080
it's a towel then you could have just

201
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,390
said it's a towel tomatoes are not water

202
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:29,330
balloons so let's say the knee did take

203
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:30,890
off in popularity how exactly did this

204
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,450
town have Improv Everywhere wannabes

205
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:34,230
find Ted in the middle of the forest

206
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:36,509
[Music]

207
00:06:36,509 --> 00:06:40,330
actually no but I think he's gonna get

208
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:42,310
to that part really soon yes that's

209
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,259
right he got sent home it's story again

210
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:45,849
just so the movie could remind us how

211
00:06:45,849 --> 00:06:47,650
battle here is how cute the girlfriend

212
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:50,020
is and how cool his grandma is we get it

213
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,669
Columbo is reading The Wonder Years Kato

214
00:06:51,669 --> 00:06:53,080
book just get back to Wesley and

215
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,300
Buttercup already oh you know me just

216
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,099
Cruise and putting out the vibe the

217
00:06:57,099 --> 00:07:01,990
creepy vibe this works go whoa Britt's

218
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:04,000
actually got a superhuman arm if need

219
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,470
bill had a pro team he could lead them

220
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:07,090
to the AFC Championship so they could

221
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,830
blow a lead to the Patriots why did the

222
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,210
once-ler think inviting his super

223
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:11,680
annoying and unsupportive family on here

224
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,240
would help this RV breaks the first law

225
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,039
of thermodynamics so bad it makes Ted's

226
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,509
house from a cart seem almost plausible

227
00:07:16,509 --> 00:07:18,550
also wow is there laundry that already

228
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:20,349
needs drying this isn't some rinky-dink

229
00:07:20,349 --> 00:07:23,889
operation anymore I got plans big plans

230
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:25,990
because one person warrior invention is

231
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:29,560
a hat a tree falls the way it leans be

232
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,690
careful which way you lean yeah well a

233
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:33,370
strong carries liquid the way you suck

234
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,229
so be careful how hard you suck see we

235
00:07:35,229 --> 00:07:37,389
can do it too well what else can we do

236
00:07:37,389 --> 00:07:39,460
we could always start chopping down the

237
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,800
trees but wouldn't harvesting the Tufts

238
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,630
be the better action in the long run if

239
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,009
the trees cut down it can't grow any

240
00:07:45,009 --> 00:07:50,050
more this is bad is about as deep as

241
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:51,639
this movie wants to go and exploring its

242
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:53,050
environmental message maybe I'm

243
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:54,400
expecting too much from a kids movie but

244
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,050
even the dr. Seuss book it was based on

245
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:58,330
is more nuance than this and it even had

246
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:04,690
to rhyme and everything this may be the

247
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:06,009
worst song I've ever heard one of these

248
00:08:06,009 --> 00:08:07,509
kid flicks seriously this makes

249
00:08:07,509 --> 00:08:08,919
VeggieTales feel like Handel's Messiah

250
00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:10,840
in comparison what an absolute piece of

251
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,210
Barbra Lutz cat

252
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:14,740
the animal that doesn't want self

253
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:19,900
someone else's so this is essentially

254
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,490
the circle of life made simpler one

255
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:23,050
could say the Lorax is just The Lion

256
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:29,380
King for dummies this could just as

257
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,789
easily be the slogan for illumination

258
00:08:30,789 --> 00:08:45,970
studios oh come on newbie there's no way

259
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:47,500
this character got this greedy and this

260
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,120
evil this quick screw you a movie right

261
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,680
and you're smooth you know that strange

262
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:57,420
secret hole in your groovy loose club

263
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:02,649
the very last one that may stop you you

264
00:09:02,649 --> 00:09:03,970
know my problem with the story is that

265
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:05,589
he isn't so much undone by his greed

266
00:09:05,589 --> 00:09:07,270
he's actually undone by his complete

267
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:10,690
ignorance of basic botany I wonder so

268
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:12,370
younger O'Hara looks exactly like O'Hara

269
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:13,990
except with braces our bracelets now

270
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:19,779
shorthand for doom Butte sold over 52

271
00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:21,070
million of these things and he should

272
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:23,020
have made some profits the last truffula

273
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:27,610
seed you need to plant it Ted you have a

274
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,350
seed this whole time where did you get

275
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:29,529
it

276
00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:31,270
why couldn't you use it why on Zeus is

277
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,010
green Gribble grass did you not try and

278
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:34,149
plant it when you were in full

279
00:09:34,149 --> 00:09:35,920
megalomaniac mode why is he just

280
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,720
disabling this surveillance catnap he's

281
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,100
been to see the once-ler three times now

282
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,570
come to think of it as big a deal as

283
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:41,920
this movie made over O'Hara's

284
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,510
voyeuristic tendencies how did he sneak

285
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,950
out so easily twice more after being

286
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:46,810
warned setting aside that this destroyed

287
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:48,520
camera somehow still has power if I'm

288
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,870
reading this boot-up string right that

289
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,130
looks like he's trying to reboot and

290
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:52,540
keeps getting errors and therefore

291
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:53,920
should not be functioning near enough to

292
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,709
grab this information the scene had a

293
00:09:56,709 --> 00:09:57,940
few drops of water spilled on it and

294
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,560
seconds later is already sprouting even

295
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,000
beyond the premature tree germination

296
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,500
how would a tree that reproduces this

297
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:06,660
quickly even be in danger of extinction

298
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:09,490
I'm sure just go sue here is happy the

299
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:11,649
decoy worked but has she forgotten she's

300
00:10:11,649 --> 00:10:13,329
close to toppling off this ledge exit

301
00:10:13,329 --> 00:10:14,920
vehicle first laughs later you know when

302
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,690
your life is no longer at risk safe to

303
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:18,010
guess the Ted's mom with the opposite

304
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:19,660
direction is these three to lead this

305
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,490
truck away as a decoy so how exactly are

306
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:23,140
they now crossing paths and if Ted's mom

307
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,550
didn't go the opposite direction just

308
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:28,319
consider this a sin for her stupidity

309
00:10:28,319 --> 00:10:31,209
Wow geez granny you just bone owed that

310
00:10:31,209 --> 00:10:34,870
dude have a little compassion nice to

311
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,430
see they let Zack Snyder director seen

312
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:38,170
we don't why you're really against trees

313
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,660
because they produce fresh air it's

314
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,759
called photosynthesis how does she know

315
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:44,740
this who taught her about photosynthesis

316
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:49,089
in a world without trees but exactly how

317
00:10:49,089 --> 00:10:50,560
I'm having a hard time grasping the

318
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,180
geography here aren't we just in the

319
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,100
town centre and did he have to drive up

320
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,230
a huge hill to hit the wall also how is

321
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,790
he even knocking down the wall here when

322
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,170
he left need bill the first time it

323
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:00,370
didn't look like the sign had any road

324
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:02,199
below it also he drove around inside the

325
00:11:02,199 --> 00:11:04,000
wall it's Hollow and at least 30 feet

326
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,470
wide he may punch a hole but he ain't

327
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:07,629
taking it down also also that is either

328
00:11:07,629 --> 00:11:09,399
and muddy strong bulldozer or that is

329
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:10,870
one weak-ass wall my guess is that

happening from this distance this might

343
00:11:35,889 --> 00:11:37,209
have gotten fixed a whole lot sooner if

344
00:11:37,209 --> 00:11:38,889
