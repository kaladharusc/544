1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:04,040
t-series is just a few subscribers away

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,350
Red Alert red alert

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,650
I'm calling upon my last trick I have up

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,450
my sleeve I didn't think it would come

5
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:16,560
to this but I guess I have no choice the

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:22,320
one thing that can stop t-series book

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,840
review you noticed how as soon as I

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,910
stopped doing book reviews sorry about

9
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,160
that by the way T's series two sways out

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,980
of nowhere and took over but no I

11
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,380
realize now in the eleventh hour what I

12
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,070
must do

13
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,860
I must review books again that's

14
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,079
whatever one wants that's what will stop

15
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,480
T series it's never been so clear to me

16
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,760
I can't believe I realized it just now

17
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,450
book time the first book well I read a

18
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,640
lot of books but I wanted to select the

19
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,649
ones that I really really loved there's

20
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:54,149
three of them but I want to talk about

21
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:56,520
and hopefully you'll check them out as

22
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,590
well the first one is the Master and

23
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:01,350
Margarita written by Nick Nicola Mikhail

24
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,690
Bulgakov it was written during the

25
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:06,600
Soviet Union regime and during that time

26
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,450
I didn't know this but atheism was sort

27
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,909
of forced upon the population it was

28
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:13,770
forced in schools and people were

29
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:16,320
generally harassed into becoming

30
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,570
atheists so this novel is sort of an

31
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:21,390
answer to that a lot of Russian books

32
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,000
I've read so far our features themes

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,369
around Christianity but I think it's

34
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:28,350
safe to say I never read a book like

35
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:32,220
this it's a black satire it's a black

36
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:36,150
satire comedy around Christianity it's

37
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:39,000
very weird but I really loved it

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,720
ironically mikail the author burned the

39
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,880
first version of this book because he

40
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,259
thought he would never make it as a

41
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:48,030
writer writing a story like this during

42
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:50,030
this time and

43
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:52,940
he wasn't wrong because when he actually

44
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,979
finished it 10 years later he died

45
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:56,960
shortly after so it's nothing funny

46
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,590
about that

47
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:59,720
and he wasn't published until 26 years

48
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,540
after that so it took a while but it was

49
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,580
recognized as a masterpiece and it

50
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:07,250
really is the story follows a mysterious

51
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:10,069
character who visits a group of writers

52
00:02:10,069 --> 00:02:12,500
sitting in a park during an autumn

53
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,140
afternoon and this mysterious character

54
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:18,770
is a professor in black magic these

55
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:20,600
group of writers are obviously curious

56
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,940
who he is and they suspicious that he

57
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:26,030
might be a spy and he gets mistaken for

58
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:28,580
one this mysterious character is the

59
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:31,610
devil reincarnated and named in the in

60
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:34,280
the book Vohland all the writers are

61
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,730
atheists and Bolin describes the second

62
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:40,519
setting of the story which in Jerusalem

63
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:42,560
during the Pontius Pilate trials

64
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,959
everyone knows about this the the trial

65
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,030
is about the execution of Jesus the

66
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,489
writers almost say it's possible that

67
00:02:49,489 --> 00:02:51,200
it's never happened it's possible that

68
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,019
Jesus never existed and boland sort of

69
00:02:54,019 --> 00:02:56,660
smugly describes his event as if he was

70
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,329
actually there which is obviously

71
00:02:58,329 --> 00:03:01,250
impossible bolon also predicts that one

72
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,989
of the writers head will come off in an

73
00:03:02,989 --> 00:03:05,450
accident and this of course gets brushed

74
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:09,590
off but later becomes true and get

75
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,269
witnessed by one of the other writers

76
00:03:11,269 --> 00:03:13,519
Yvonne Yvonne goes absolutely crazy

77
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,160
trying to pursue boland trying to

78
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,280
capture him in absolute madness

79
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,290
absurdity and comedy I love reading this

80
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:23,630
part it gets even better from there The

81
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:25,970
Devil's midnight ball is wasn't one of

82
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:27,530
my favorite parts of anything I read in

83
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:30,049
a while it's it's just fantastic so I

84
00:03:30,049 --> 00:03:32,450
will just end it there but Micaela

85
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:35,049
the author of The Master and Margarita

86
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:38,269
he used to be a playwright so it makes

87
00:03:38,269 --> 00:03:41,030
the writing very visual I can really see

88
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:43,640
all the characters and mannerism and the

89
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,739
humor in front of me it really feels

90
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:47,180
like you were there when you read it and

91
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,890
which really works well for the comedy

92
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:50,480
as well I laughed

93
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,610
a lot of times reading this book and all

94
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:53,930
this has really put together in a

95
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:56,030
masterful story it's a story that blends

96
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:58,640
history with the author's own stories

97
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,879
that he he lived through and his own

98
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:05,540
strides it's a perfect balance I think

99
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,849
of good and evil and I really really

100
00:04:07,849 --> 00:04:09,530
loved it it was actually recommended by

101
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:11,599
one of you guys so I read one of the

102
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,129
comments saying in another book review

103
00:04:13,129 --> 00:04:14,660
saying oh I think you're really gonna

104
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,609
love this book and you were right so

105
00:04:16,609 --> 00:04:18,799
thank you very much the master margarita

106
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:20,660
five out of five thank you for

107
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,150
suggesting an actual good book the next

108
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:25,010
book I want to talk about it as Japanese

109
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:28,639
death poems and haiku what is it called

110
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,680
it's a really long title Japanese deaf

111
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,139
poems written by Zen monks and haiku

112
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:35,270
poets on the verge of death that may

113
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:37,220
sound very depressing to read but for me

114
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,289
I thought it was very uplifting I'm very

115
00:04:39,289 --> 00:04:41,539
fascinated by the Eastern view or the

116
00:04:41,539 --> 00:04:44,090
eastern Asian view of death as a Swedish

117
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:46,760
person it's almost a taboo subject it's

118
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,320
something that I grew up you don't

119
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,210
really talk about and I think that's

120
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:51,770
probably for a lot of people who has

121
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:53,630
least watches this video which I think

122
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,610
makes it just even lonelier and scarier

123
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:57,889
to think of that I don't think it's a

124
00:04:57,889 --> 00:04:59,900
healthy approach and the Japanese view

125
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,120
is more of a it's something death is

126
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,860
something that's part of life one of my

127
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,660
favorite quotes from a book another

128
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,910
great book I read actually I recommend

129
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:11,180
in the region would by Murakami death is

130
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,490
not the opposite of life but an innate

131
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:15,919
part of it by living our lives we

132
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,280
nurture death anyhow this view of death

133
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,000
is deeply rooted in Japan and Japanese

134
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,460
culture through death poems or just say

135
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,470
as their call that sounds funny and its

136
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:30,440
origin comes from Zen Buddhism and the

137
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,830
first documented Zhu se is from Prince

138
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:37,820
Tatsu in 1686 but just like still

139
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,160
occurring today I find out about deaf

140
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,139
poems from one of my favorite writers

141
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:44,030
Yukio Mishima and I was just so

142
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:46,550
fascinated by the fact that that's an

143
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:47,660
actual thing

144
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:51,410
a small night storm blows saying falling

145
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:54,139
is the essence of a flower preceding

146
00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:56,750
those who hesitate to put it simply it's

147
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,350
a poem written at the time

148
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:00,600
that but sometimes they're written even

149
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,150
before sort of as you write a will for

150
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:05,310
example haiku is a form of poetry you're

151
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,660
probably already familiar with it

152
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,180
follows the five seven five syllable

153
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:09,810
count

154
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:12,420
vashu world famous Japanese poet who

155
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:15,690
defined this style of writing where you

156
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:18,540
count the syllables of the poem his deaf

157
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:21,780
poems reads as falling ill on a journey

158
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:25,080
my dreams go wandering over withered

159
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,870
fields haiku is often focus on the

160
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:31,770
transient of things thus often reflects

161
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:36,560
on nature bringing in the sadness of

162
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,290
leaves falling from the cherry blossom

163
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:41,880
because they don't last very long for

164
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,580
example here's one written by Beynon now

165
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:47,790
spring has come into my world farewell

166
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:50,310
so the book starts off with Zen Buddhism

167
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,950
which it's actually my favorite part of

168
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,210
the book I didn't think I would enjoy it

169
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:56,520
I kind of wanted to just jump to the

170
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:00,600
Hyksos but it just features incredible

171
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,390
stories of Zen Buddhists or masters that

172
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:07,410
died sitting upright and right after

173
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:10,050
they finished their last brush strokes

174
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:12,570
of their poem I don't know if that's

175
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:14,310
true or not but it just sounds it sounds

176
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,350
badass and I like the idea that there's

177
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:20,220
actual records of this badass Munk movie

178
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,980
cliche that you see it actually has some

179
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,740
merit to it the book features around 300

180
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,890
haikus some are funny some are sad some

181
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:29,700
are strange

182
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,100
I'll read some more examples I wish to

183
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,740
die in spring beneath the cherry

184
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,350
blossoms while the springtime moon is

185
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:39,990
full written by Saigon here's another

186
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:42,480
one I liked death poems are merit

187
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,240
delusion death is death this one's

188
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,690
written by by psyche the journey west a

189
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:51,660
way that all would travel flower-filled

190
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:55,500
west is said to be where the paradise is

191
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,010
in I don't know when they believe in

192
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:01,320
their dying with the regret is seen as a

193
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:04,140
bad thing to carry when you're passing

194
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:06,230
over to to the paradise

195
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:08,120
this poem is a perfect example of a

196
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,920
haiku because it brings in something

197
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,890
personal mixed with nature another one

198
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:15,680
for example I long for people then again

199
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,640
I load them end of autumn it's almost

200
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,740
comical isn't it how can we fit nature

201
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:24,230
in there and a bottom but I really do

202
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:26,930
love haiku I think it's a it's a perfect

203
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:28,880
way to really describe an emotion I'd

204
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,750
really like the idea of bringing

205
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,090
something over bringing structure to

206
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:34,940
something abstract of a mixing left and

207
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,820
right brain mixing art with logic for

208
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,850
example having the the set of rules of

209
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:43,070
how a poem should be and now I think

210
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:45,050
that's what really makes them good as

211
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:49,940
well so I wrote a poem myself heritage

212
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,860
if you want him autumn moon shines

213
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:54,490
bright a lonely red leaves falls down

214
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:59,300
your mom gave no I'm just kidding okay

215
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,910
at ending road ahead I should travel

216
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:05,060
back home soon forever sunset the way

217
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,550
the Japanese language works it's

218
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:10,220
obviously different because the

219
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:13,450
syllables are are much more defined as

220
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:17,660
were the letters are cold goal Wow gosh

221
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:20,960
she and someone and so forth so it

222
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,490
doesn't really work the same way in

223
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:24,470
English and there's all kinds of

224
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:26,450
techniques that also doesn't really

225
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:28,730
translate so it's never gonna be

226
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,800
you can try and translate haikus to

227
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,270
English but it's never gonna be the same

228
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:34,820
thing obviously but I recommend writing

229
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,500
a haiku it's it's actually really easy

230
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,860
it's actually really fun all you need to

231
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,260
know is that it's five syllables first

232
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,810
line seven syllables live em in line and

233
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:47,600
then five syllables afterwards and it's

234
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,110
usually something personal mixed with

235
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:52,990
nature and

236
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:57,490
a passing moment described so why don't

237
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:59,940
you try it I wouldn't give this book

238
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,350
higher than a four star rating

239
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:04,720
it is quite dense in the beginning it

240
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,450
felt like I didn't need to it also had a

241
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:10,480
strange structure to it which was kind

242
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,010
of annoying when reading it other than

243
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:13,750
that it's a great book it features a lot

244
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,100
of haikus that's never been translated

245
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,560
before so I really really loved it and I

246
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,990
remember commended to you even as much

247
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:22,209
as any other book I talked about today

248
00:10:22,209 --> 00:10:26,680
next but dumb Keshawn yeah that's right

249
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,390
you never heard about this one everyone

250
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,070
knows about donkey Shawn but the

251
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:32,860
nobleman who read too many night stories

252
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,990
and decided to go on a knight's errand

253
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:37,209
hey even though that doesn't exist

254
00:10:37,209 --> 00:10:39,010
anymore everyone knows about the story

255
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:41,170
of donkey shot who mixed up the

256
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:43,630
windmills with Dragons and fought them

257
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:44,290
anyway

258
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:45,520
but I think most of all everyone knows

259
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,490
danke Shon for its humor and for how

260
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:50,470
silly it is and and what a loveable

261
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:53,560
character is but and yes it is it is

262
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,570
very humorous but after reading it I

263
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:57,790
realized that it's so much more than

264
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:00,490
just that and I'm so glad I read it it's

265
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:01,930
my favorite piece of classical

266
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:03,610
literature that I have ever read it was

267
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:06,880
written in 1600 by Cervantes I don't

268
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,050
know I probably pronounced that wrong

269
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:09,550
and it's been described as the best

270
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:11,950
literary work ever written I've also

271
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:15,520
seen is described as unreadable there's

272
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,079
a lot of different versions of donkey

273
00:11:17,079 --> 00:11:20,230
shot to make it more normal

274
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:22,300
I don't know I read I remember I read

275
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,310
donkey shot before but a stripped down

276
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:26,410
version of it but nothing really could

277
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:28,480
read the original the book is written in

278
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,300
a way where donkey shot seems like he's

279
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,310
an actual person that exists in the

280
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:35,800
world a terrible example would be kind

281
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:40,120
of like found horror movie clips to make

282
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,000
it seem real this is lost archives to

283
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,770
make it seem like oh yeah this is this

284
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,510
is a real story that actually took place

285
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:48,160
in donkey shot is a real person

286
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,230
in the second half of the second part of

287
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:51,940
the book Cervantes is even himself

288
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,100
mentioned in the story because of course

289
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,720
the first book has already come out and

290
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,390
donkey shot is now famous and donkey

291
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:01,839
shot reacts to other people reacting to

292
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,180
donkey shot which is hilarious as well

293
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,010
so it's

294
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:06,840
it's really funny and bizarre thing but

295
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,420
anyway the story also of course follows

296
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:12,210
not just donkey shot but he's famous and

297
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:15,090
loyal squire sancho panza who joins

298
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:17,460
donkey shot in the promise of becoming a

299
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,780
governor one day

300
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,480
Sancho had great relief to donkey Shawn

301
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:26,010
because he sort of questions his ideas

302
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:27,810
and his sanity and all these random

303
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:30,960
insane inter fair interactions that

304
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,700
donkey shot goes through when in his

305
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,340
pursuit of knights-errant virtue and all

306
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,860
that because donkey shot believes

307
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:41,430
everything he's reading in books so he

308
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:44,250
treats the whole world as if that's the

309
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,650
case and anything that sort of

310
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:48,750
challenges that idea and goes against

311
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:52,050
that idea he blames on one way or

312
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:54,000
another it could be that oh it's a

313
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,030
wizard sage cast a spell on me so I'm

314
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:59,930
under under illusions and that's why

315
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:02,820
that's why I see it for no one else does

316
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,830
what makes this funny or I think at

317
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:06,600
least what makes this work is that

318
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,060
donkey shot is actually completely

319
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,220
reasonable as a person the way he

320
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,290
justifies all these things happening and

321
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:16,760
the way he justifies his action is

322
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,560
completely reasonable you realize he's

323
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,170
not an idiot he's not a pool and he can

324
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:24,720
suede Sancho Panza to to follow him and

325
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,460
do what he wants him to do and he

326
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:29,700
believes it himself 100% as well that's

327
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,200
the thing but of course other people

328
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,330
don't believe donkey shot and whatever

329
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:36,120
ideas he has and he becomes a mockery Oh

330
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,820
for them as well the fact that donkey

331
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,790
shot wholeheartedly believe is it it

332
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:44,130
makes it really sad it's a really sad

333
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:46,230
story in a lot of ways I think a lot of

334
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:48,300
people can probably relate to as at

335
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,890
least when you were younger wanting to

336
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:52,050
do something noble wanting to do

337
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:55,020
something greater but as you grow older

338
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:57,060
you you sort of give up on that idea I

339
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,190
mean everyone does obviously but not

340
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:04,470
donkey shot and this story tells tells

341
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:06,600
of that tale and you can really only

342
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,880
love him for him donkey shot and Sancho

343
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,070
Panza really are legendary characters

344
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:13,710
I I miss them it's really weird to say

345
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:15,930
that it's such a long book but it's the

346
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:17,850
it's the longest book I've read but it's

347
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:19,410
also the longest book I've ever enjoyed

348
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:21,780
and honestly I can't wait to reread it I

349
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:24,570
could go on more but there's really no

350
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:26,700
point it is it is quite hard at some

351
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,160
points and I would lie every lying say

352
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,750
if I thought it was like the easiest

353
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,870
read I ever had but it's 100% worth it

354
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:36,360
so check it out if you're interesting

355
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,910
check out all these books donkey shot

356
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:42,960
five out of five beautiful I'm so glad I

357
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,690
read it now for next book review I

358
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,880
wanted to mention a book that you guys

359
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,650
can read and we can discuss it in next

360
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:51,870
book next month if I do a book review

361
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,730
when I do a book review it will be the

362
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:56,670
woman in the dunes by a Cobra Abin I

363
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:58,050
don't know if that's how it's pronounced

364
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:01,170
kebab has been described as the Casca of

365
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:06,690
Japan it's a pretty short story so holy

366
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:09,660
shit I forgot to mention the book it has

367
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,900
some very strong sexual parts in it I

368
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,880
guess this is a trigger warning I

369
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,260
probably should have realized before I

370
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:19,110
recommended this but anyone can pick

371
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:20,910
this up and read it in I don't know a

372
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:23,070
week or two and it's a concept that I

373
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:25,590
think it's a interesting to discuss so

374
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:27,390
if you're looking for something to read

375
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:29,580
check that out and I'll talk about it in

376
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,710
the next month as always if you have

377
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:34,140
recommendations for me I always find

378
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:36,270
that interesting I've also created a

379
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,700
subreddit where you guys can discuss as

380
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,130
well and interact and I will take part

381
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:44,490
from that and reviews and ideas in the

382
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:46,740
next book review so hopefully we can

383
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,600
have a more of a dialogue going because

384
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,790
I felt like that was what was missing I

385
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,710
felt a bit discouraged doing book

386
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:56,250
reviews because it felt like no one is

387
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,560
actually cared or or interacted with it

388
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,390
or read the books but I'm told now that

389
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:02,280
a lot of people actually did which i

390
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,380
think is really cool I feel so will

391
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,240
fault myself because I think in this

392
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,120
pursuit with t-series I've been to focus

393
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,070
on the numbers and just pushing that

394
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:14,310
narrative which has been fun but I also

395
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:16,770
kind of miss just doing whatever I feel

396
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:18,040
like or whatever

397
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,940
I actually have a more personal interest

398
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,730
in so anyway that's it that's it for

399
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:26,050
book review I hope you guys enjoyed I

400
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:27,399
know these are very long and very

401
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:30,160
different but I hope it's fun anyway see

402
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:35,000
you guys tomorrow good bye
