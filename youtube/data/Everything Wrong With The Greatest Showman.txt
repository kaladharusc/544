1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:10,380
40 full seconds of logos from 20th

2
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:11,940
Century Fox and Friends including a

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,650
multi era double low going right off the

4
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:14,969
top if you think singing is gonna make

5
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:16,500
me overlook excessive logo action you've

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,690
got another thing coming

7
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:20,520
19th century dabbing ladies and gents

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,100
this is the moonship way to fool the end

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,150
of the movie there's no way those

10
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:25,650
jugglers in the back were mid juggle of

11
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:26,939
that many rings in a completely dark

12
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:31,740
room so the wire considering this is

13
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,000
revealed to be a young Barnum

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,380
daydreaming it's pretty impressive that

15
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,059
he correctly dreamt up the exact people

16
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:37,739
he would later enslave I mean exploit I

17
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:42,540
mean hire to be in his show you your

18
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,070
circus may be utterly transcendent that

19
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:45,719
doesn't give the viewer any vitamin A or

20
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:47,520
riboflavin her excellent spit-take has

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,780
drenched the front of her dress here but

22
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,010
by the time she gets to her father it's

23
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:52,079
completely dry how does that fire anyway

24
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,000
how would you get out no kidding but

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,379
more importantly how did you know to

26
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:57,239
meet here our picturesque Oceanside

27
00:00:57,239 --> 00:00:58,680
bluffs just magnets for children

28
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,690
destined for storybook relationships

29
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:11,610
even the flashbacks are singing that

30
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,439
feels like home you climbed an overgrown

31
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,909
fence to look through fog got a house

32
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:16,740
built 200 years ago and somehow bad

33
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,330
feels like home this is the most tough

34
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,040
animated kid friendship ever put to film

35
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,320
since I guess the Fox and the Hound we

36
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,550
can live in the world that we

37
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:28,860
then why to sell this point did you

38
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,210
design what looks like poison ivy is

39
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:37,620
abandoned workshop ecstasy that

40
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,270
particular light making that Lian shadow

41
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:40,920
is about as likely as my shadow looking

42
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,360
like Chris Hemsworth also literal

43
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,460
foreshadowing separated at youth look

44
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,080
I'd let this relationship mean something

45
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,640
if it were taking place later in life at

46
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,410
elementary school-age boys and girls

47
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:50,670
aren't making lifelong relationships

48
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,080
they're watching cartoons and thinking

49
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,200
about cooties

50
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,570
the notebook the song he literally goes

51
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:58,950
for his father's funeral - stealing

52
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,299
bread and might even be the same day

53
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:02,850
also how does a young PT not know that

54
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,649
you don't run until your spotter if he

55
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:06,090
grabs his bread nonchalantly he may have

56
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:07,080
gotten away with it reversed

57
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,090
pickpocketing also how the does he

58
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:09,899
know where she lives

59
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:11,310
and if he's dropping mail into the bag

60
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,989
of the girl's mail carrier and is in the

61
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:14,640
same city in neighborhood why not go

62
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,820
visit

63
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:18,820
[Music]

64
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,660
[Applause]

65
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,570
dreams is shouldn't that fancy finishing

66
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:24,890
school have taught her about subject

67
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:26,750
verb agreement and after nine minutes of

68
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,010
super sympathetic flashback memories

69
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,840
movie hopes you can finally be happy for

70
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,580
PT Barnum because he's young and in love

71
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:32,990
like you were once even though you

72
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,370
didn't turn out later to be a racist

73
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:36,230
abusive manipulative asshole I mean you

74
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:39,560
probably didn't soon tire of your life

75
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,020
of having nothing tell that to Cleveland

76
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:46,400
Browns fans this song feels like it's

77
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,720
been going on for about ten months

78
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,220
here's a sin for the candling the

79
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,630
out of this scene bull with all the

80
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,110
candles

81
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,460
Bruce was at his all mightiest in

82
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,570
providing the moon for this rooftop

83
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:54,860
number little-known fact

84
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,660
thousands of young lovers die every year

85
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,280
when their partners fail to catch them

86
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,570
at the last second during romantic

87
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:01,760
rooftop musical numbers holy that song

88
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,500
made her pregnant PT's pencil led breaks

89
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,910
and he gets all flustered by it instead

90
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,410
of picking up one of these spare pencils

91
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:07,790
in the middle cup on his desk and just

92
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:09,290
continuing he even goes to sharpen that

93
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,550
dead pencil rather than switched to a

94
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:12,590
new one my point is the real PT Barnum

95
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,750
was a racist abusive son-of-a-bitch what

96
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,250
do you call those two girls honestly

97
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,680
regret numbers one and two i legit don't

98
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,300
even remember their names like just see

99
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:24,730
regret oh look he invented the rave

100
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:27,470
Jesus in Christ even a movie mocking a

101
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,030
musical that over uses a theme song

102
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,590
wouldn't use the theme song as often as

103
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,570
this non parody movie does what are you

104
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:34,880
looking at flop doodle doodle there was

105
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,530
no way that was ever an actual insult

106
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:45,530
you louse a gobbler in the South China

107
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,750
Seas so you lied about ships that you

108
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,370
stole from your employer to defraud a

109
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:50,420
bank to give you a loan

110
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:55,070
oh you rapscallion you see you not see

111
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:56,450
that elephant until just now

112
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:58,550
it's literally five feet away so she's

113
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:00,709
planning to buy eggs bread onions a

114
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:03,320
lemon flour and potatoes four and

115
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,850
guessing at least a week if not longer

116
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:07,550
that is a high-carb low-protein diet has

117
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:08,780
a decent breakfast in those ingredients

118
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,760
but all the other meals are gonna suck I

119
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,230
realized they're poor right now and

120
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:13,370
that's actually the point of showing us

121
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:15,350
this grocery list but if she's got money

122
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:16,669
for groceries I think she could stretch

123
00:04:16,669 --> 00:04:18,500
it further than she has here I mean I

124
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,450
hear Big Top Ramen is cheapest I am

125
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:22,790
putting together a show and I need a

126
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:23,360
star

127
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,070
the real Barnum's first star was an 80

128
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:27,140
year old black woman he claimed was 160

129
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,700
years old and was George Washington's

130
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,500
nurse and when she died he charged four

131
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,360
tickets to see her autopsy wonder why I

132
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,980
didn't make the movie

133
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,350
put a laughing well I'm not laughing

134
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:38,090
anyway kids who might as well get paid

135
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:40,130
this is the fictional nice version of PT

136
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:41,480
Barnum this movie came up with and even

137
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,310
he's an opportunistic asshole they won't

138
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:43,880
laugh

139
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,650
they'll salute he just basically

140
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:47,120
admitted people would laugh at this guy

141
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,800
now he's saying this and because it's a

142
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,540
movie this flip flop is gonna work is it

143
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,950
time for the upbeat and fun finding

144
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,720
people Barnum can exploit montage let's

145
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,260
do it

146
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,540
how's the looking girls is one of his

147
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,620
daughters right-handed and one

148
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,180
left-handed or did you cheat on that in

149
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,590
order to symmetrically frame the shot

150
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:01,850
with their arms pretty sure I know the

151
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:03,560
answer so here's a set Teen Wolf

152
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,390
Slender Man fatter Jon Lovitz Glenn

153
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:07,610
Close after his perm Daniel de Dracula

154
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:09,710
Lucy who tattooed Colonel Mustard Keaton

155
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,960
lands on a leg and put us on stage Owen

156
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,640
County on an entertainer that leverages

157
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,930
the controversial nature of their work

158
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:16,460
for their own gain I want to be against

159
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,960
it my business model depends on me being

160
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:22,700
for though I certainly can understand

161
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,810
the excitement of someone you will

162
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:25,580
eventually name dog boy jumping up on

163
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,200
your desk the high-five wasn't actually

164
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:33,140
invented until the 1970s that guy is 500

165
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,030
pounds the way asa butterfield is 300

166
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,890
roughly 10% of this movie is footage of

167
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:38,720
poster reveals dog boy milk

168
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,670
get your dog boy milk here everyone

169
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:42,050
loves drinking milk named after a dog

170
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,090
boy so you have the guy you described as

171
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:46,130
a very good thief taking tickets and

172
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:47,690
handling all your money the savvy

173
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:49,310
business acumen with his Barnum guy just

174
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:52,160
never stops he could catch it oh oh Hugh

175
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,750
Jackman wanted to stern another musical

176
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,980
and instead of filming something like

177
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,720
The Music Man remake seriously picture

178
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,040
Hugh Jackman as Henry Hill and tell me

179
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:03,830
it's not goddamn perfect they made this

180
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,180
real-life O'Hare from the Lorax here

181
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,070
joins every other performer in not only

182
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,450
being a freak that Barnum can exploit

183
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:14,240
but also somehow an incredible singer

184
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,980
none of this was rehearsed fYI I know

185
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,720
they expanded quickly they even have a

186
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,220
physical ring now and an offstage

187
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,080
dancing bear as well my point is that

188
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,460
the passage of time is something this

189
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,870
movie cares a little about and cares

190
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,490
even less about how much you care about

191
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:28,560
it due to this ovation Barnum mistakenly

192
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,300
believes people love freak shows when in

193
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,530
reality they just love well

194
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:33,240
choreographed choral performances does

195
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,280
it bother you that everything you're

196
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,800
selling is fake critic as the villain

197
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,960
cliche also is it a problem in your

198
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,430
movie when the main antagonist is

199
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,510
actually the one who makes the most

200
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:44,790
sense theater critic you can't find joy

201
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:47,850
in the theater now who's a fraud still

202
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:50,130
you Barnum still you movie waits 34

203
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:52,190
minutes before even trying to Efron play

204
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:54,900
big good money to watch people stand

205
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,280
around at all for two hours and they

206
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,300
call me a con man

207
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,310
I can't even with this bullsh did Barnum

208
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,720
truly must understand entertainment this

209
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,100
grossly could he have been successful at

210
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,510
all if he was this misguided about the

211
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,530
habits of the everyman

212
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:06,090
while mr. and mrs. Barnum argue about

213
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:07,440
how to cure their daughters bullying

214
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,880
problem it's worth pointing out how

215
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,890
sinfully oversized this bedroom is and

216
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:13,500
also how sinfully overlit it is handle

217
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,090
much room you understand this just

218
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:16,650
associating with you could cost me my

219
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,660
inheritance then why are you here you

220
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,770
knew who he was when you agreed to come

221
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:20,970
to this public bar and share several

222
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:22,440
drinks with him it's line of dialogue is

223
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,300
pure gibberish filler bulls right here

224
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,910
right now I put the uh friend I never

225
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,260
knew how much I needed a musical version

226
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:34,090
of shark tank until right now

227
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:36,550
you gotta play the irony here is that

228
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,169
he's suavely winning over a member of

229
00:07:38,169 --> 00:07:39,310
the rich elite because he feels

230
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,750
inadequate in dealing with the rich

231
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,430
elite and it's a marketing manager to

232
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,900
help sell his circus to the rich elite

233
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,949
the likes of which he is currently

234
00:07:44,949 --> 00:07:46,570
selling to perfectly this barroom

235
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:48,010
choreography between the bartender

236
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,600
Jackman and Zachman is genuinely

237
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,430
impressive and magnetic but considering

238
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,050
that both just down at least seven shots

239
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:54,490
within four minutes I'm pretty sure

240
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:55,720
they'd barely be standing up at this

241
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,070
point let alone pulling off these moves

242
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,810
you'd better come see this you'd better

243
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:00,520
come see this cliche all the snobs in

244
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,169
New York read he does it thinking for

245
00:08:02,169 --> 00:08:03,280
them this creator bitching about a

246
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,840
critic seems overly sensitive and unable

247
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:08,790
to just enjoy his creative freedom I

248
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,750
guess I'll just have to tell the Queen

249
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,669
that either all of us go well none of us

250
00:08:12,669 --> 00:08:14,650
will remember this is the 1860s but

251
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:16,540
here's rich white Zac Efron's character

252
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,280
champion racial equality because he fell

253
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,380
in love miss Lynd let me get to the

254
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,030
point I'd like to bring it to New York

255
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:23,740
and if you agree on making the most

256
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,419
famous singer not in Europe but in the

257
00:08:25,419 --> 00:08:27,130
entire world wasn't his show about

258
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:28,870
curiosities he's lost sight of his

259
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,220
original vision is what I'm saying and

260
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,690
now he's just another everyday producer

261
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:33,370
and here up in the balcony for mr.

262
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:34,960
Barnum's first legit show for the

263
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,760
highbrows stand the freaks from the show

264
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,320
that made Barnum famous and I can't help

265
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,789
but ask how the hell did those losers

266
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:41,500
get tickets oh and also shame on Barnum

267
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,880
and stuff I like this movie better the

268
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,200
first time I saw it when it was called

269
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,580
like jungle water for chocolate fever

270
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,560
elephants finally the highbrow set up

271
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,480
law to show Barnum produced and his face

272
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,070
suggests he has finally fulfilled and

273
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:52,600
yet there's still almost half a movie

274
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:52,990
left

275
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,760
damn it the fact that they couldn't find

276
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,260
a real bearded lady and that their

277
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,940
makeup job ends up looking like overkill

278
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,830
in every scene I mean she's about to

279
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,450
sing the film's most moving song but

280
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:03,520
George Costanza toupee look more real in

281
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:11,709
this lady's beard not gonna lie this

282
00:09:11,709 --> 00:09:13,510
song is incredibly powerful probably

283
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:14,620
because it comes from the characters

284
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,940
that actually deserve the spotlight

285
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,770
also because PASOK and Paul should write

286
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:19,450
all the musicals ever from now on

287
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:21,520
wasn't she come if I asked wait is there

288
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,200
a ton more to your backstory sitting on

289
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,760
the cutting room floor because this line

290
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,170
kind of makes no sense unless there was

291
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:27,490
at one point a plan to make their

292
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:29,500
romance a bigger story element also I

293
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,850
wasn't sure you'd come if I asked is

294
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:32,230
exactly what my college girlfriend used

295
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,640
to chant during sex in order to get me

296
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,010
off honestly in the mid 1800s how much

297
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:37,720
lime green clothing was there really I

298
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,100
feel like she stands out here at the

299
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,540
theater more for this ugly dress than

300
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:43,180
for not being white mother-father this

301
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,390
is an wheeler

302
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:46,710
have you no shame interracial

303
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,480
relationships in the 1800s would have

304
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,070
been an interesting thing to explore but

305
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:51,750
as with everything in this film instead

306
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,460
of actually mining the truth and depth

307
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,260
of the issue this plotline is resolved

308
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,460
with all the complexity and weight of a

309
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,590
fuller house episode also his parents

310
00:09:58,590 --> 00:09:59,640
just happened to be coming down the

311
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,410
stairs at this moment what a coincidence

312
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:02,670
and why are they leaving the theater

313
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:04,530
before the show starts Wow he changed

314
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:05,850
out of that terrible lime-green dress

315
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:07,230
into her I'm so angry I'm gonna rehearse

316
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:09,300
clothes and lightly pastime what do you

317
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,160
choose leave it to a white person to ask

318
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,320
this question who can stop me if I

319
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:20,010
decide wait let's hear those lyrics

320
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:22,830
again spoken slowly by me so who can

321
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,660
stop me if I decide that you're my

322
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,490
destiny this is a stalker song bordering

323
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:28,020
on something even more sinister who

324
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,400
released the weight that is pulling her

325
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,410
on this rope was it on a time delay also

326
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:33,060
how is this act something that can even

327
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,220
be practiced solo forget even the safety

328
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,390
element there are so many weights and

329
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:37,560
pulleys involved in this you would need

330
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,460
a team of people to make it happen

331
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,200
unless of course you were rewriting the

332
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,430
laws of physics along with the Stars

333
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:44,380
Cirque de foreplay

334
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:47,230
[Music]

335
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,310
magically appearing second rope appears

336
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:51,020
magically if I wasn't asleep already I'd

337
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,190
say something about the physics of that

338
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:53,780
jump and catch we just saw after all

339
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,160
that she still says no to her

340
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,900
relationship man imagine the musical

341
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,340
number the guy she does say yes to is

342
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,930
gonna get also why is the nephrons

343
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:01,760
character going on you know I thought we

344
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,870
just had a romantic moment with the

345
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:03,890
swinging and the dancing and the

346
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:05,600
sweating why are you leaving when we

347
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,340
would ever be enough for you I'm doing

348
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:10,430
this for Caroline and Helen my father

349
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:12,590
was treated like dirt I was treated like

350
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:15,110
dirt the balls on the screen movie not

351
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,910
only as PT Barnum no longer a racist

352
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,560
abusive opportunist like he was in real

353
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,510
life he's also worthy of pity because he

354
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:22,490
was looked down on in his youth pity the

355
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:24,800
sad white boy in 1835 America because he

356
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,060
didn't have enough money for his daddy

357
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,950
to own slaves this will be a seen these

358
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:29,630
girls watch their father go from poverty

359
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,670
to starting a museum to turning it into

360
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,500
a circus to going on tour with an opera

361
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,700
singer certainly this is taking a few

362
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,380
years at least and yet they stubbornly

363
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:39,230
refuse to age at all sneaky James Kelch

364
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:41,150
this forced love triangle is also

365
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,560
completely fabricated by all accounts

366
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,030
Jenny Lynn actually quit the tour

367
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,530
because she was sick of Barnum's tacky

368
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:47,120
marketing not because he didn't fall for

369
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,830
her bedroom eyes I've given you the

370
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:51,380
world not really you helped him make a

371
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,150
lot more money but he still got battles

372
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:54,950
to wage and foes to win over he bought

373
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,960
him a little credibility not all of it

374
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,190
this is like me paying my neighbor's

375
00:11:58,190 --> 00:11:59,390
rent for three months and then saying

376
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,890
well then I've given you the world have

377
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:04,250
a not this is our town son we think you

378
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:07,130
should leave you and your freaks and

379
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:09,770
your spooks I'm legitimately confused at

380
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,060
this point about who the movie wants me

381
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,710
to think is racist and bigoted Barnum

382
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:14,960
went on tour with Jenny Lind in 1850 ten

383
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,340
years before Lincoln would be elected

384
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:18,350
president so at predicting the future to

385
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:19,880
Barnum's freakshow and Barnum's

386
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,620
historical reckoning is complete he is

387
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,180
now a hero who would literally run into

388
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,380
a burning building instead of the

389
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:25,910
shyster who would sell tickets to a fire

390
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,620
he started himself they survived this

391
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,510
unlit leash acht how much this movie

392
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,980
turns into a discount backdraft at the

393
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,420
end another critic might have even

394
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:35,300
called it the celebration of humanity

395
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,220
continuously callous critic considers

396
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,900
converting core conviction creating

397
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,610
confusingly quickly kowtow in character

398
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:45,830
cliche ask I would have said yes I never

399
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:47,210
minded the risk but we always did it

400
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:47,690
together

401
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:49,340
did you though you were in the dark when

402
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,900
he secured the loan for a business you

403
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,220
knew nothing about and you had no clue

404
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,360
when he bought the giant house you live

405
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,560
in when exactly did the two of you

406
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,390
decide to do anything together yep you

407
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:58,400
guessed it all the put-upon people he

408
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,720
called freaks to sell tickets

409
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,699
somehow collectively decided Barnum is

410
00:13:01,699 --> 00:13:03,500
good and have come to revive his spirits

411
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,600
for one last big musical number and this

412
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,129
is either gonna make you cheer or else

413
00:13:07,129 --> 00:13:08,449
you have a conscience and long ago

414
00:13:08,449 --> 00:13:09,620
realized this movie was actually a

415
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,420
cautionary horror film does Barnum own

416
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,370
this bar why is this wall a tribute to

417
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:14,930
his accomplishments if he did on the bar

418
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:16,310
would they name it Petey's bar and num

419
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:18,259
nums he ran into a fire to save people

420
00:13:18,259 --> 00:13:20,389
and now she's his girlfriend

421
00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:21,740
her diary she was about how society

422
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,660
would react and yeah now that he's a

423
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,519
hero society will love him which makes

424
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,379
this girl a sellout I hate that idea

425
00:13:27,379 --> 00:13:29,420
little-known fact in the mid-1800s

426
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,800
patients were encouraged to participate

427
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,449
in heavy kissing as part of the

428
00:13:32,449 --> 00:13:34,670
rehabilitation process so if I can't let

429
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:37,399
you gamble it on me everyone was already

430
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,920
happy just and already no circus in

431
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,120
history ever had enough square footage

432
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,769
to allow for this fictional moment where

433
00:13:42,769 --> 00:13:44,420
the ringleader a dozen dancers and to

434
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,980
live elephants collectively run at the

435
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,810
speed synchronized mechanical lighting

436
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:48,860
in the mid-1800s

437
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,480
well anachronism was never cease the

438
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,829
last two minutes of this movie mostly

439
00:13:51,829 --> 00:13:53,509
comprised of after everything got worked

440
00:13:53,509 --> 00:13:55,370
out circus footage can just go off and

441
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:57,170
die already this is for you hand with

442
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,670
the hat gift Barnum successfully passed

443
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,439
on his legacy of racism and opportunism

444
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:02,089
to a younger white person did theaters

445
00:14:02,089 --> 00:14:04,279
then have pachyderm parking did he ride

446
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:05,509
that thing all the way from the circus

447
00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:07,129
is there anything this man won't make

448
00:14:07,129 --> 00:14:08,990
about himself and his own spectacle this

449
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:10,100
feels like the final shot from an

450
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,389
entirely different movie than the one I

451
00:14:11,389 --> 00:14:13,370
just watched also she's playing a tree

452
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:15,889
at a ballet recital in the wide shot I

453
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:17,240
don't see a single other person playing

454
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:17,720
a tree

455
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,279
did she make her own tree costume and

456
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,379
sneak onstage I'll be ass for second

457
00:14:21,379 --> 00:14:23,029
daughter cameo it was obvious reading

458
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:24,800
also there's a sucker born every minute

459
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:31,130
but tomato tomahto

460
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:37,670
the poor elephants of the apocalypse in

461
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,829
America

462
00:14:39,829 --> 00:14:43,139
forming feats of only imaginable aerial

463
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:47,670
skill the flying Grayson's you something

464
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:50,240

peanuts

466
00:14:53,960 --> 00:15:04,120
[Music]

467
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,700
so I can say that's always yes I

468
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,440
don't know what you expect to find out

469
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,790
there Gerry you know what you want

470
