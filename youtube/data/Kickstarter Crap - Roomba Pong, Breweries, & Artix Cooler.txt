00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,550
going to use the old technique of

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,370
searching up a keyword to find shitty

5
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:13,650
Kickstarter projects and the key word

6
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:17,760
for today is beer yeah that great

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,250

that happened we're gonna start off by

11
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,070
looking at some beer pong projects

12
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:34,670
otherwise known as Dodge pong moto pong

13
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:39,120

14

get fucking wasted dodge pong and moto

17
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,660
pong are these not so brilliant ideas

18
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:49,800
that were ripped straight off of a

19
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,140
reddit post yeah this version which is

20
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,930
the Dodge pong version it's got it's

21
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,600
just a poorly photoshopped image of beer

22
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,149
cups on a Roomba moto pong is the clear

23
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:00,870
winner here

24
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:04,589
however at 160 dollars it's still not

25
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:06,960
the thing you want to spend any money on

26
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,659
because you're not an alcoholic and if

27
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:11,670
you are an alcoholic much better to

28
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,159
spend it on alcohol first look the

29
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,689
future of beer pong has arrived

30
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:18,119
moto pong now see if any ladies cash to

31
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:22,700
make shot huh bitch you just got pawned

32
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,680
this dude yeah don't laugh dumbass I

33
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,080
mean this in the sweetest way but beer

34
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,259
pong is a gutter trash game for people

35
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:33,810
who want to spread the cash out and have

36
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:37,049
maximum enjoyment for as little cash as

37
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:40,079
possible this shit is for people who

38
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,920
have money boozing out of their assholes

39
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,270
speaking of money using out of people's

40
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:48,960
assholes 2016 presidential pong this

41
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,390
brilliant idea is where we plaster the

42
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,579
two most unlikable people on the planets

43
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:58,180
faces on the outside of beer pong cups

44
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,250
to upgrade the conversations across

45
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:03,490
homes and parties in America let's

46
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,560
upgrade the conversation about politics

47
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,540
the best way of doing that is drinking

48
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,880
because everyone becomes more coherent

49
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,380
after a few beers Trump is a faggot

50
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:16,930
Trump's China thing kind of makes a bit

51
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:19,959
of sense slope is not coherent Li

52
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:22,420
explained what he is going is that a

53
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,100
drunk person or is that just a fucking

54
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,530
retard let's hear the clever metaphor

55
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:29,140
analogy thing that comes with Bernie

56
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:37,540
Sanders on the ping-pong ball our next

57
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,310
beer pong project is called mighty pong

58
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:42,850
and it is essentially just beer pong

59
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:45,760
cups of different sizes and I don't know

60
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,250
why it's not called King pong for like

61
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,110
the King Kong thing cuz they got a big

62
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:52,840
fucking harambe looking ape as their

63
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,690
logo with his hand on a volleyball and

64
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:57,459
his other hand wrapped around a fifth

65
00:02:57,459 --> 00:02:59,860
street hooker this is a whole new

66
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,760
evolution in adult party games

67
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,840
[Music]

68
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,760
the graduated cups increase the thrill

69
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,860
and skill it seems like they're going

70
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,380
for an intentionally shitty vibe and

71
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,840
they're able to achieve it in some ways

72
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,610
but in other ways it just ends up being

73
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:18,810
shitty a good example is this blowing on

74
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:21,720
the balls thing see every party needs a

75
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,970
great there are balls would you like me

76
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:30,239
to blow on them for luck this is getting

77
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:30,630
good

78
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:33,959
she's fucking awkward hey guys what

79
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:40,140

teeth from beer pong to breweries the

85
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:56,940
other beer projects that are on this

86
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:00,030
website all have to do with go-getter

87
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:02,519
dudes who don't really want to go and

88
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:04,590
get get her they just want to have

89
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:07,080
people fund their fuckin brewery I'm

90
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,760

91
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,280
manager of help had a Brewing Company

92
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,710

93
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,660
if I would still be doing it I don't

94
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,100
care how much passion you got in your

95
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,870
beard all right you have all the passion

96
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,609
in the world you can love hops you can

97
00:04:21,609 --> 00:04:24,220
get married to barley and you have sex

98
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,840
with wheat but it's not gonna do a

99
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,210
goddamn thing for me or anyone else when

100
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:29,860
you have nothing to offer us you just

101
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,560
asked for 20,000 dollars to open a

102
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,290
fucking brewery so our big passion

103
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:39,250
really is to kind of break into a market

104
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,980
that everyone's ignoring I love beer

105
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:45,550
I've loved beer ever since my barber put

106
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:48,100
on Mumford &amp; Sons while he was trimming

107
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,450
my beard with a straightedge razor

108
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:52,780
that's when I knew I loved beer and I

109
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:55,060
knew I wanted to open up a brewery in my

110
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:58,180
hometown kill a kid Arkansas we're gonna

111
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,940
make beer so good you're gonna have to

112
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:05,910
stop and think to yourself dang it

113
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:10,030
that's one good beer our last barely

114
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:12,850
related to beer project is the Arctic's

115
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:15,070
cooler our goal was to create a

116
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:17,050
multifunctional product that could serve

117
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,940
as a dream bottle while also turning

118
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:21,610
into a portable beer holder hot beverage

119
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:24,730
container and a dream shaker in this one

120
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,590
segment alone he's done way too fucking

121
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:30,070
much let's add a background let's cycle

122
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,200
through videos let's add a transparent

123
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,419
striped pattern over each video let's

124
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:37,570
add some screen shake let's add a really

125
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:40,210
awkward white cross effect transition

126
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:44,410
between every clip the best part is that

127
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:47,020
Artie's cooler can be customized to meet

128
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:50,110
each person's need why have nice product

129
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,640
shots when you can make it look like

130
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,010
you're demoing the latest iPad I've

131

activities with my family and I'm always

133
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:59,800

134
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,200

136
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:09,190
like that man it's really popping and

137
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,600
it's very relatable because I'm a

138
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,729
Mexican skateboarder myself and you know

139

144
00:06:32,949 --> 00:06:37,539
I know it's cyberpunk however comma ambi

145

Oh cold drink in a hot South Florida day

157
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:18,490
little harsh calling a piece of shit

all of them is it's more than just a
