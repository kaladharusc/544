00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:29,840
It's a new show (Not)

First off, I challenged the irish green person  (Hey at least he has original content)

16
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,880
He took the challenge FINALLY.

17
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,760
You know what, i got to recognize it. Mark however,

18
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,500
Not a word.

19
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,000
HES ON VACATION GODDANGIT-

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,120

21
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,400
He cant sleep at night.

22
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,280
Oh, I never reacted PewDiePie's reaction video.

23
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,800
That's what he's thinking.

24
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,020
PEWDS IS UNAMUSED

25
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:00,940
Mark, whats wrong with you? How can you laugh at this?  This is so sad.

26
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:02,460
This is so sad.

27
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,520
Alexa, can we hit 50,000 likesss

28
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,680
*Points at Alexa* Jack is making fun of you!

29
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:15,100
Alexa are you just gonna take this?!?

30
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,820
You're a coward just like Mark, Alexa.

31
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:23,980
It is the most advanced iPhone we've ever created. And i'd like- TO TAKE MORE OF YOUR MONEY

32
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:25,940
BECAUSE BASICALLY I&quot;M MONKEY

33
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:27,300
I mean its a good-

34
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,980
I am not laughing! (no one said you were) I am not laughing!!!

35
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:33,360
But that's a good meme. That's a basically a monkey that's just snook out of nowhere

36
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,820
Basically i&quot;m monkey!

37
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,520
Me too!

38
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,980
Me: hi baby My cat:

39
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:44,200
*DEMON NOISE*

40
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:49,400
Oh, i bet you. I bet you 99% of people laughed.

41
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,400
*ANOTHER DEMON NOISE*

42
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,820
*PLEASE STOP TORTURE*

43
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,160
Pewds screaming: WHAT IS HE DOING?

44
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,880
Don't ever explain the context out of this.

45
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,880
The fact that I have no idea where this is from

46
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,620
Just makes it so good.

47
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,500
Give me a good one.

48
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,700
Give me a good meme.

49
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,960
Hey! Look its me! (Yeah we know.)

50
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:12,240
*EARRAPE*

51
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,080
NO

52
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,560
What are you doing Felix!

53
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,340
You're not supposed to laugh!

54
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,900
It feels very real.

55
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,900
Look! Like I'm wielding this gun.

56
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,720
People should not let me wield a gun.

57
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,300
I mean, how do you talk like that?

58
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,920
I've said this before. But i'm amazed.

59
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,780
I'm amazed by his accent.

60
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:35,980
Vield, we should not let people vield (In really bad accent)

61
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:42,099
I cannot, I cannot be more Svedish when i talk.

62
00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:44,100
Can you tell.

63
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,340
Can you tell?

64
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,320
See? I can't even fake my own accent!

65
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,200
*Pewds dying*

66
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,440
Empty your bullets!

67
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,980
Put in one bullet.

68
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:56,140
So you have one bullet in the gun, yes?

69
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:56,740
I do.

70
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,580
Okay. Me too.

71
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:05,460
So let's close the gun

72
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,460
Your turn

73
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,200

Sorry for not putting subtitles on what they were saying. I'm lazy...

84
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:38,560
My gun is f*****g empty! (family friendly)

85
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,970
Ohhh my god

86
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:45,480
Wait. Did we just oh my god at the same time? Oh that's beautiful.

87
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,860
We're not going to top that. That's beautiful.

88
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:51,260
lilfatherfigure he always does good memes.

89
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:51,760
Stoppppp please ninja

90
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,180
On March 15 an online explosion occurred when ninja is joined by-

91
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:57,669
It really bothers me how ninja doesn't tie his pajama pants.

92
00:03:57,669 --> 00:03:59,640
Like I get it you're wearing it as a meme,

93
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,000
But at least tie them. You're not a savage.

94
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,300
Hiphop artist Drake for a game of Fortnite

95
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:14,180
*ZOOMS INTENSIFY*

96
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,600
I knew it.

97
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,980
I knew it was time for drake to rise up.

98
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:25,880
We have infiltrated the highest level of your &quot;mainstream&quot; society.

99

Prepare and fear the day that gamers will finally rise and take our rightful place as the leaders of (THE WORLD)

100

of one something! (strong speech there pewds)

101
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:52,960
Hey! You know what? Captain Marvel looks great. I actually really want to see it now.

102
00:04:52,960 --> 00:05:00,200
Is that the actual trailer?

103
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:18,620
Wait, wait, sorry wait, hold up. What is the context here? What's the context?

104
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,960
Oh my god!

105
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,380
Woman came through the ceiling dropping about 25 feet

106
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,600
Patrons screamed

107
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,660
Ah that's hilarious.

108
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:31,180
She WAS LOOKING FOR THE BUS STOP!

109
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:35,540
She was looking for the bus stop. Of course!

110
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:38,320
Sorry, sir! Where is the bus stop?

111
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,100
IN THE CEILING

112
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:45,880
I'm notorious for hating Marvel. Okay? I don't like 'em. But can someone explain,

113
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,100
I know this is the kind of thing

114
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:51,830
Where I will- I will make a statement and everyone will fill me in and I will feel like an idiot. (Pretty much)

115
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:57,400
But why is she called Captain Marvel? Is that not the dumbest name? (I've heard worse - PewDiePie?)

116
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:05,240
I have ever heard for a superhero. What is next? Mr. DC universe person. Hey look! There he is!

117
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:10,300
What the heck? What the frick guys? I don't get it. Can you come up with any more?

118
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:27,440
It's like you ran out of names. What should we call Captain Marvel, copyright also now by Disney what the frick guys?

119
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,880
Oh man

120
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,170
Props for their creativity.

121
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:35,120
It's like you make these random noob movements their like:

122
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,520
I have no idea how anyone would implement that into anything.

123
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,840
HUWAAAAAAAAA

124
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,280
Did I just run through a sheep?

125
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,640
Oh

126
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,540
Special Move: High Kick!!

127
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:56,040

Oh, great!

139
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:12,280
No, why?

140
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,280
That's alright. I do the same thing all the time. (everyday)

141
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:30,540
There's no shame

142
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,520

What?

146
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,900
I can't.

147
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,780
Uh-huh. This is too sweet. I can't.
