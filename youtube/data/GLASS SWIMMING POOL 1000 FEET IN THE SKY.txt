49
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:21,390
right now the one seat yet today is a

50
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:24,500
different event entirely from yesterday

51
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,260
two events two different days put

52
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,150
back-to-back it's part of the reason why

53
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:30,440
I decided to make the long trip to

54
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,470
Helsinki is because the opportunity to

55
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,420
speak to different audiences on two

56
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,730
different days was just

57
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:39,980
really good timing it's so cold outside

58
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:42,230
right now it's like freezing outside

59
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:44,090
I'm not I'm not trying to make excuses

60
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:48,770
but this thick fog rolled in and I don't

61
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,150
know how to get around this town but I

62
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,830
could always see the tower of the hotel

63
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:56,500
where I'm staying and now I don't lost I

64
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,330
think it's over here somewhere

65
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:02,410
