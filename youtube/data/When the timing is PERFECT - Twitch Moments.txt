idea for a video today twitch perfect

11
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,540
time moments you seen these videos you

12

heard about this hilarious okay

13
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,100
it's basically streamers they said all

14
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,840
day and all night playing video games

15
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,700
what a bunch of losers and then

16
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,379
eventually something funny happens

17
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:51,059
because not because they they themselves

18
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:54,420
are entertaining coming from me it's the

19
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,800
kind of thing you don't really like but

20
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,500
it's kind of thing you just go funny so

21
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,469
let's react to that today everybody

22
00:01:00,469 --> 00:01:03,270
I'm the hype man everybody I know how to

23
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,060
make stuff interesting they'll destroy

24
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,580
you Marcus

25
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:22,860
you gotta go you gotta go yeah go yes

26
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:26,369
Detroit become human the PlayStation for

27
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:29,850
heard the call alright I'm out there was

28
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:31,939
there was there some in here that like

29
00:01:31,939 --> 00:01:34,950
like obviously we want but like it seems

30
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,920
like I just realized this is me watching

31
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,530
Nova watching some other guy watching

32
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:44,159
Miley Cyrus 2018 everybody everybody

33
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,990
else enjoys them so I guess they just

34
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:47,399
they would run with the narrative that

35
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,860
you know that everybody everybody

36
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,009
enjoyed it instead of keeping us in

37
00:01:53,009 --> 00:02:07,940
there to be like this videos in Shh

38
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,099
[Laughter]

39
00:02:10,099 --> 00:02:12,660
that's good that's a wholesome funny

40
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:16,140
play see how dare you question the

41
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,569
integrity of the fine brothers Nova

42
00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:21,750
disgusting can't believe anyone would do

43
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,060
that these speculations with no grounds

44
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,680
on them all right you know what this is

45
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,750
actually pretty fun I'm actually doing

46
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:35,790
what is this guy creeping as well he

47
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:38,730
lives I figured out why he was creeping

48
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:41,430
nothing hey how about that a funny video

49
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:46,459
that was funny she shoots and he gets up

50
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:49,079
he's saved she saved his life

51
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:50,700
you know what maybe I was a little harsh

52
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,370
these are actually quite enjoyable let's

53
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,010
keep watching smash like if you enjoyed

54
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,900
this video right now saying how nice the

55
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,819
cars were as also a look at this kid

56
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:04,620
Stan this bicycle kids don't do now

57
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,329
that's a sandwich nine-year-old right

58
00:03:06,329 --> 00:03:08,190
there you decided on your own to follow

59
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:13,739
me you are incorrect sir kill ya

60
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:25,260
that's unreal that was perfect timing

61
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,940
though I got a bit wait I gotta say it

62
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,489
again sir Kelly yeah you decided on your

63
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:31,079
own that's unreal

64
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:37,049
I feel like the people that watch these

65
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:38,549
streams they know what the trigger is

66
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:43,250
and they'll use it at the perfect time

67
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:47,280
that's kind of sad

68
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,630
though impressive but in the two hundred

69
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,160
years they didn't like neither of them

70
00:03:51,160 --> 00:04:00,880
fell off the pier until that's funny

71
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,260
actually I thought that we're glued or

72
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,540
something you can buy cough syrup with

73
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:12,370
other without what do you call it we

74
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:14,650
call it blue see you that was such

75
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:18,580
perfect moment such relatable awesome

76
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,709
sauce everybody it's much like if you

77
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:22,750
thought that was that bad guys and I

78
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:41,020
wanted six okay Rankin's reaction is so

79
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:48,310
again look at have no idea what's going

80
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:50,500
