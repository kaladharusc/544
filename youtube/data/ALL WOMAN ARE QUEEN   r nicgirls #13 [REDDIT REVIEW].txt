1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,540
Everyone on YouTube knows me as a nice guy.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,140
I'm practically the nicest guy on the entire planet.

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:07,920
Not to brag or anything;

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,620
but I am a such a nice guy.

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,090
When women reject me,

6
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,200
I do not reach for my AR.

7
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,840
I reach for my fedora.

8
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,340
I respect you.

9
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,580
I respect you too damn much.

10
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:21,840
Please live a full life without me.

11
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,340
That's how nice of a guy I am.

12
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,200
But what I respect even more than nice guys,

13
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,700
such as myself by the way,

14
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,760
is of course nice girls.

15
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,100
That's right.

16
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,820
Girls can be nice too.

17
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:37,100
So let's go through some examples of nice girls,

18
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,559
because

19
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,140
I just respect you too damn much not to.

20
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:44,460
(Reads title)
Because guys aren't allowed to find women attractive.

21
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:54,940
(Reads)
My girlfriend told me she would suck John Mayer's peepee in front of her own dad, because she loves him so much.

22
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:55,820
Same.

23
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:59,609
(Reads) I said the girl on Netflix showed we were watching was cute

24
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:04,020
(laughing)
and she got mad and told me to watch it myself.

25
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:06,580
See, she is being nice here.

26
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:09,680
She's like she's stepping aside.

27
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,120
Realizing when she stepped over boundary.

28
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:16,470
Oh you like this girl, I will step aside. Enjoy yourself.

29
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:17,360
Have a good time.

30
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,020
(Reads) My wife gets when I have Piper as companion (laughing) in Fallout 4.

31
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,520
(Reads) Yeah, we can meet up and go through the project.

32
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,900
(Reads) It looks easy enough. We can finish quick.

33
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,980
Wow this seems like a great time,

34
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,940
you know, a boy and a whaman.

35
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,729
Just working on their science project together.

36
00:01:33,729 --> 00:01:36,140
(Reads) Okay, just don't try anything.

37
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:40,640
(Reads) You were talking about your girl last class and I don't want to interfere with that.

38
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,780
(Reads) I've been the other woman before and I don't want to ever every do that again.

39
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,720
I don't want to ever redo that.

40
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:53,940
(Reads) I saw you staring at me last class and I don't think you should be going,

41
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,720
Be doing that if you have

42
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,800
(reads slowly and quieter this time)
a girl.

43
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:03,740
(Reads) You brought three honey buns to class. I was staring cuz I thought you'd offer one.

44
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,760
(Reads) You didn't by the way.

45
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,800
See she's clearly just making sure of this persons diet

46
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:14,960
What a nice girl. Those damn unattractive people staying in loving relationships.

47
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:20,500
(Reads) I get really depressed when ugly people get lasting relationships

48
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:25,760
and I can't find a single decent boy to want me back.

49
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,090
It's tough being a nice girl.

50
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:31,500
Guys, it's really though. (claps hands)

51
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,300
This whaman just wants a lasting relationship.

52
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,480
And look at all these ugly people.

53
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,440
How dare they, how dare they?

54
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:47,140
(Reads) My boyfriend is set for hours playing this and ignoring me. So I fixed his little issue.

55
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:52,400
(Reads in maniacal voice) It's cruel and basically abuse to pick a game over your girl.

56
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,060
(weird &quot;kreee&quot; noise)

57
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:58,900
Come on that's full at 4. She's practically doing him a favor here!

58
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,780
(laughs)

59
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:10,220
(Reads) Are you home? Yes babe. Take a picture with a spoon on top of your head. Why?

60
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,260
(Reads) To prove you're home!

61
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,260
(Reads) Okay, wait.

62
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:18,200
(laughs)

63
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,000
Hmmm, hmmmmmmmm

64
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,380
Male: What?

65
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:26,000
Female: You could've taken that yesterday

66
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Male: WHY TF WOULD I TAKE A PICTURE WITH A SPOON...

67
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,550
You never know, see this is what I'm talking about.

68
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,420
a whamen (chuckles)

69
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,600
A real whamen questions everything.

70
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:41,500
iI isn't just, she doesn't just buy into anything that the man or anyone says.

71
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:45,400
She doesn't fall for the lies of the media, and boyfriends.

72
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,440
She's too woke for that.

73
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,200
Why don't you add a timestamp?

74
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:53,460
Everyone knows you need to engrave a timestamp in the spoon that you put on top of your head.

75
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:59,560
This is really the fault of the man here and I completely agree with the whamen as I do always.

76
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,030
this is-

77
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:06,010
how to solve an argument with the whamen: flowchart

78
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:08,540
Is the whamen wrong?

79
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,900
Yes

80
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:14,000
Whamen is never wrong. Is the whamen wrong? No --&gt;

81
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,260
Whamen is never wrong

82
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:18,780
That's right everybody -claps hands- whamen is never (wrong)

83
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:23,220
Did the whamen murder someone? Is the whamen wrong? Whamen is never wrong.

84
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,700
Did the whamen copy strike your videos?

85
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,460
(giggling softly)

86
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,870
Whamen is never wrong.

87
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:36,240
(Reads) Because saying how you actually feel in a healthy manner is sooo overrated if I throw a fit and tell you to-

88
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:43,220
(Reads) Leave, please don't leave because I will be over in like three minutes. Okay. Hang in there, baby.

89
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:48,850
This reminds me of '13 Reasons why', have you guys seen that? Or is it '12 Reasons why'? I don't remember.

90
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:54,500
There's this one scene where the main character basically tells the guy:

91
00:04:54,500 --> 00:05:02,220
'LEAVE! JUST GO!' And he goes 'no... No, I really want to stay with you, please like don't tell me to leave, babe'

92
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:05,740
'LEAVE, JUST LEAVE. Why aren't you listening?'

93
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:09,120
'Please. Oh god. Okay fine. I will leave.'

94
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,980
'Why did you leave me?'

95
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,460
(laughing)

96
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:21,640
I'm not even making fun of it. It's exact.. verbatim. I know I'm pushing this meme pretty hard like I don't (laughs)

97
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,760
We're just having fun here guys, okay, please!

98
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:28,800
We are respecting whamen here on this channel. No funny business.

99
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:37,340
Whamen are always right, all whamen are a queen. Can we get in the comments everybody so that it doesn't get

100
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:40,249
miss-misunderstood by

101
00:05:40,249 --> 00:05:44,300
random articles that will pick one comment out of context.

102
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:47,080
And be like 'this is what people think out of this video.'

103
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,280
'We found one comment saying this.'

104
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,120
(Reads) What do boys even find attractive about boobs?

105
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,260
(Reads) They're literally a ball of fat on a girl's chest.

106
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:02,620
(Reads) Like if you can love me for the fat on my chest, why can't you love me for the fat on my stomach?

107
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:08,960
(little squeals and almost-silent laughter)

108
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,380
Why don't you love all my fatty lumps, huh?

109
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:17,620
You only care about the to fail in love with the boob milk come from (?). (Reads) Why do women find hair attractive on man?

110
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:21,000
Why don't why can't they appreciate the hair on my butt as well?

111
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:28,960
(Reads) Hey. I hope you don't mind me asking who this is. We met at Snoopys in SR last week.

112
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:34,699
(Reads) You don't remember? I met a lot of people there. So no sorry. Mind if I ask how you got my number?

113
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:38,330
I overheard you give it to the dude you were learning with.

114
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:44,229
I gave it to him since he asked. Not okay to do that. Sorry. I think I'm done here. Why not?

115
00:06:44,229 --> 00:06:47,839
It's harmless, though-thought we could get to know each other.

116
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:54,129
Sorry, but I don't even know who this is, and I'm a bit uncomfortable with this. It's Naomi, my bad

117
00:06:54,129 --> 00:06:58,880
I didn't say it earlier. Sorry. It's super. So you're gonna be there on Friday, right?

118
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,180
(dramatic piano music)

119
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:07,140
Jesus Christ! I didn't realize girls were equally psychopathic as boys.

120
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:12,539
This has really changed him. This has changed my perspective on a lot of things

121
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:16,020
(Reads in high mocking voice )Honestly, I hate online dating websites.

122
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:23,400
When I ask a man how tall he is and he asked me how much I weight back. It's a sign of immaturity

123
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:29,000
Let me break this down: every human is different and we all come in a unique shapes and sizes

124
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,520
but as long as you ask me what my unique shape and size is

125
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,780
(almost not-understandable) You're an immature bastard!

126
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:40,350
And I agree also, of course. (Reads) I don't know how to read

127
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:42,889
american measurement 5'6'' in China

128
00:07:42,889 --> 00:07:49,189
You are still 5'6'' in the US. That measurement is solid and looks the same all over the world.

129
00:07:49,189 --> 00:07:53,760
Why you know me if she's a weightlifter I am over 200 pounds weight. How much is that Tony?

130
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,760
Why you know me if she's a weightlifter? That's pretty impressive.

131
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,240
(Reads) But I carry my weight-

132
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,240
She is a weightlifter!

133
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:06,330
(Reads) Like a damn Queen. But someone taller or shorter than me with the same weight is gonna look different from me.

134
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:08,180
So when I ask how tall a guy is,

135
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:13,250
I'm trying to see on the most basic fundamental level if I'm going to be attracted to you.

136
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:16,340
(Reads)  My number on my scale is not going to change anything about me.

137
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:22,380
I love how she's so... Aware. She's so self-aware.

138
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:28,100
That's what I love about whamen...like this one. It really makes you think.

139
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:33,000
Oh! This is the original? Is this the original of the meme that everyone keeps posting?

140
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,560
(Reads)  Why can't I find a guy like (woooaw sound)

141
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,720
Hey,!- No.- I'm literally the guy in the pic.

142
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,600
I always thought that's what the original was. That's hilarious.

143
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:49,220
This proves that whamen doesn't really want anyone. (Reads) Me: I'm so happy in this relationship!

144
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:55,830
Also me: plant a hair tie in his bed, pretend it's not yours, blame it on another girl and start a fight.

145
00:08:55,830 --> 00:09:02,689
Jesus Christ this reminds me of that clip. ''promised me we would have two kids and now he doesn't want any more.''

146
00:09:02,689 --> 00:09:04,320
(Crowd awwws)

147
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,580
''My friend think I should trick him and stop taking my birth control.''

148
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,860
(crowd shocked 'oh' and Pewds surprised 'WTH!')

149
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:13,820

''I'm embarrassed to say this because I don't like spousal lying. However, men have never been in control of our bodies.''

151
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:25,260
''We're the ones in control. I'm not going to suggest that you do that''

152
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:30,920
''but look into my eyes and tell me what I'm saying, okay?!'' (crowd applauses)

153
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:36,360

159
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,920
