36
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:11,020
you know we're kidding

37
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,450
not one zombie map but we're getting

38
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:20,020
three zombie maps yeah zombie zombie

39
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:23,890
three zombie box three zombie maps oh

40
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:30,010
yeah hey joho you know we're improving

41
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:32,140
Call of Duty every year I guess what

42
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,730
we're removing the single-player

43
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:36,670
campaign experience and we are and we're

44
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:42,330
adding not one but three zombie maps

45
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:46,410
we're doing less work we are doing less

46
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:49,930
work and charging you the same price

47
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:52,450
perhaps even more because you know the

48
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:53,830
multiplayer is still gonna have those

49
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:55,330
micro transactions and they always

50
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:57,190
happen now we got a new battle royale

51
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:59,980
mode to take over new micro transactions

52
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,520
and I don't understand why people are so

53
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,460
excited about the battle royale mode

54
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:08,890
there's people that play battle royale

55
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:12,070
should already be battle royale out by

56
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:14,860
now and we're gonna get even more battle

57
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,800
royale done probably poorly No well it

58
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,600
says here that there's gonna be multiple

59
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,740
of you know vehicles so vehicles that's

60
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,840
a positive thing right vehicles added to

61
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,020
to this blackout mode on a 100 times

62
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,090
bigger map than most maps in Call of

63
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:32,770
Duty which is it hard to do it all

64
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:34,690
because their maps are tiny but they put

65
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:37,570
vehicles right now it correct me if I'm

66
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:38,890
wrong I don't play a lot of battle

67
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:41,470
royale games but if you put vehicles in

68
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,120
there and they said aircraft so this is

69
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,190
what I'm focusing on so you got a guy

70
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:47,710
plugging in a helicopter shooting people

71
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:51,030
with fucking Rockets or a jet aircraft

72
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:54,070
shooting people I mean I think there's

73
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:55,750
gonna be a little unfair and

74
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,390
free-for-all I don't see how that's

75
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:00,610
going to work if there's 10 jeeps and

76
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,860
tanks and transports and if there's

77
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,420
tanks I don't know if there's tanks I'm

78
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,580
making that assumption but you know most

79
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,410
of the vehicles in battle royale modes

80
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:11,650
are for transport only and so if that if

81
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,930
that's the case here putting vehicles in

82
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:15,550
Call of Duty and then saying we've got

83
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:18,430
vehicles now is kind of cheap ya know

84
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,560
it's like not really an implementation

85
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,840
and and and in their free-for-all mode

86
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,460
where there can be only one winner I

87
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:27,820
find that that would be really bullshit

88
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,340
I'm going to assume because obviously

89
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,080
it's not gonna work that way it's not

90
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,220
fun like that

91
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:36,130
is not going to be fun so there it's

92
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:38,380
gonna be duo's or squads let's assume

93
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,870
squads because I saw multiple people or

94
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:43,980
at least duo's that you can get on to

95
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:49,390
transport helicopter or a ATV big in

96
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:52,900
deal that's already you know in pop G

97
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,700
that's been there for a long time the

98
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,680
only new thing is from aircraft we'll

99
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,900
see what this aircraft do it but does

100
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,910
but you're gonna make yourself a goddamn

101
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:04,960
huge target flying around I mean for

102
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,120
everybody to see it shoot down I just

103
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,710
don't see how to work and then they have

104
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:10,300
to balance these vehicles to be powerful

105
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,250
enough because you are this big target

106
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,450
and if they're powerful enough and

107
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:14,590
you're good enough you're gonna be able

108
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:17,890
to murder and what might wipe the floor

109
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:20,620
with everybody you're going to kill so

110
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,200
many people and battle royale modes are

111
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,900
kind of boring sometimes this is 15

112
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,960
minutes of fun in this walking around

113
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,580
this open map and finding the best

114
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,380
hiding spots the cheap-ass fucking

115
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,820
things or you can shoot the people and

116
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,220
then you're walking around now you're

117
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:38,680
walking around 50 minutes and now you're

118
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,300
walking around for 15 minutes and then a

119
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,910
tank rolls up or a canal copter with a

120
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:46,180
rocket and that's your battle royale

121
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,890
experience if there's weapons I don't

122
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:52,660
know and I die I have no I don't know I

123
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,910
have no idea okay how do you get these

124
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:57,610
vehicles how are they laying around or

125
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:01,180
are they gonna be kill streaks I mean

126
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:03,790
let the the people that kill the most

127
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:05,830
people get even better and impossible to

128
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:10,140
kill or oh my god are they going to be

129
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:14,160
loot boxes are you going to dead this up

130
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,960
legendary loop box and you're opens up

131
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,370
and it's the fucking tank and they're

132
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:20,080
rolling around and the people drop in

133
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:20,740
cash

134
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:25,210
oh oh no this has so much in potential

135
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:27,940
to be abused by Activision I'm sorry I'm

136
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,770
coming up with these crazy ideas because

137
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:33,040
I do not trust Activision I don't okay

138
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,479
so they're I think they're gonna take

139
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:35,830
the battle royale mode they're gonna

140
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,930
bastardize it and and it's gonna turn

141
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:42,580
into something not good now I mean oh my

142
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:46,110
god

143
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:48,910
vehicles and we're on a pig map and

144
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:50,920
there's gonna be squad so we can shoot

145
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,920
each other's battlefield yeah we finally

146
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,470
get vehicles and squads it and Call of

147
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:59,650
Duty's have been bred battlefield it but

148
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:02,680
battle royale mode where you you open

149
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:08,670
loop boxes get the tanks to helicopters

150
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,870
now look I'm not saying that's what's

151
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:13,600
gonna happen but it just it feels like

152
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,530
it it has the potential to and it's I

153
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:19,810
don't trust I don't trust Activision so

154
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:21,550
let's just focus on things that we do

155
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:24,250
know right so they showed off

156
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,920
multiplayer there looks like there's a

157
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,990
bunch of changes to multiplayer you know

158
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,120
these different equipments and and and

159
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,010
like little barriers and walls and

160
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:34,960
things well first off the big thing is

161
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,060
there's no more wall jumping there's no

162
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,430
more jet jet packing all around it's uh

163
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,950
our good old friend boots on the ground

164
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:44,920
boots on the ground is back boots on the

165
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,110
ground so people should be excited about

166
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:48,820
that I guess your Call of Duty players

167
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,260
are they excited about that meanwhile

168
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:53,890
the rest of this play but there I guess

169
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,030
so they're getting rid of the wall

170
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:58,300
running a lot of the equipment I don't

171
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,560
know when I was watching the multiplayer

172
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,770
it kind of reminded me a little bit of a

173
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:05,110
mixture between Rainbow six seeds with

174
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,490
some of that equipment they were using

175
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:08,650
and you know overwatch but that just

176
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:10,360
could have been because now it's on this

177
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,410
new the battlenet Blizzard is you know

178
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,030
trying to save the Call of Duty's

179
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:18,130
reputation and be like hey come here but

180
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:20,290
but what does that do oh they steam I

181
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:22,690
guess no more seen stats and we don't

182
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:25,810
get to know that stuff but one positive

183
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:27,700
thing is they say that they're gonna do

184
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,400
some PC optimization which is how I play

185
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,099
so it we're no longer gonna get console

186
00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:35,700
ports we'll see just how this translates

187
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:39,729
so that is one positive news that you

188
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:41,200
know it's not just gonna be a console

189
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,969
port now granted we have to see what

190
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:44,830
exactly they do they say oh the new UI

191
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:47,140
which shouldn't have been the console UI

192
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,450
in the first place that's not a feature

193
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:50,770
that's something you should have done

194
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:52,840
already and dedicated servers and this

195
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,970
kind of stuff so we'll see what that

196
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:58,639
translates into from be Knox working on

197
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:02,399
there's also health bars now above the

198
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,649
people's head so that looks pretty

199
00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:06,180
awkward at first it gets for a Call of

200
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:09,060
Duty game but I like it I could get

201
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,339
digging I guess the future technology is

202
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:13,199
so advanced that you can know what their

203
00:09:13,199 --> 00:09:15,990
health is and it kind of gives you more

204
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:19,709
feedback more information I think it's

205
00:09:19,709 --> 00:09:22,290
fine um it's just something so small and

206
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:24,529
I guess you know and and and the

207
00:09:24,529 --> 00:09:27,930
hilarious thing is that if we break it

208
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:30,360
all down so far from what they revealed

209
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,699
is they're removing the traditional

210
00:09:32,699 --> 00:09:35,040
single-player campaign they're you know

211
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,730
and they're replacing it with zombies

212
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:41,610
more zombie modes not even modes well

213
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:43,620
actually there is more modes but just

214
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,949
more maps with these different zombie

215
00:09:45,949 --> 00:09:48,930
personality characters I don't give a

216
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:52,319
shit about your zombie personality

217
00:09:52,319 --> 00:09:54,120
characters they're not heroes to me

218
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,060
they're not memorable oh yeah I can't

219
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:00,959
wait to play as old guys and I can't

220
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,350
wait to play as the one poppy chick no I

221
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:10,380
just know I and you know me guys I'm no

222
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,689
I don't want to play another sabe game

223
00:10:12,689 --> 00:10:15,839
Joe you better not be back there I swear

224
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,509
to God if Joe pops his head around that

225
00:10:18,509 --> 00:10:22,199
corner I'm gonna freak the hell out cuz

226
00:10:22,199 --> 00:10:24,389
he's not here he's at his house but who

227
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:26,250
know every time a zombie game comes in

228
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:30,990
Joe will show up randomly so I you can

229
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:33,420
imagine why I'm disappointed by this I

230
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,550
think that you're get we're getting less

231
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:38,610
for more and and and the call of duty

232
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:41,130
faithful is just eatin it up it's just

233
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:43,740
so frustrating to see them to see them

234
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,079
eat it up and and to see them defend

235
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:50,130
this stuff a triple-a publisher that is

236
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:53,029
capable of telling good stories

237
00:10:53,029 --> 00:10:56,040
cinematic stories impressive things I

238
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,740
was hoping that eventually Call of Duty

239
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:01,319
would give us branching storylines would

240
00:11:01,319 --> 00:11:03,870
give us multiple endings would give us

241
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:07,529
you know multiplayer squad play they've

242
00:11:07,529 --> 00:11:09,360
done cooperative before but you know

243
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,310
what I'm saying just expand these

244
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:14,610
he is in the campaign instead we are

245
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:17,460
removing we are deleting we are getting

246
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,800
rid of and we're supplementing it with a

247
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,400
battle royale mode guys it's just a big

248
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,620
fucking map they play some fucking

249
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,720
terrain ain't probably auto-generated

250
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,089
and then you get your fucking vehicles

251
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:32,820
in there and have at it Hoss I'm sorry

252
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,700
I'm not trying to shit on pub G or

253
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,620
fortnight's but these are some of the

254
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,870
easier games developed for it it's it's

255
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:43,710
not it's not gonna be as expensive to do

256
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:46,050
in my opinion that we should have got

257
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:47,430
this battle royale mode

258
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:51,690
in addition but again why not both why

259
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:55,110
not both is my big question okay you

260
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,940
could get that campaign we get the

261
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,220
Evolve campaign and you can add battle

262
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,980
royale that is adding value that is

263
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,320
evolving your game while improving your

264
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,960
game that justifies the price and that's

265
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,020
that takes a person like me can go

266
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:13,110
everybody buy call of duty black ops for

267
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:15,810
black ops had one of the best campaigns

268
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:18,000
and now you're not getting it anymore

269
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,650
we're ripping it out we're giving you

270
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:21,360
battle royale mode because that's hot

271
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,830
right now and everybody seems to be

272
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:25,260
playing it will it be hot in five years

273
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,660
and for three years two years and six

274
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:30,480
months I don't know maybe you're sick

275
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,580
and tired of playing battle royale by

276
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,920
now I don't know but I guess not I guess

277
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,720
now all the casuals are gonna play it

278
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,070
and then they keep putting in these

279
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:41,270
newbie modes so now you can play zombies

280
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:48,240
single-player that's exactly what I

281
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:54,300
wanted who wanted that I can't see of

282
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,120
any more useless mode that they're

283
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,270
spending time with this rush mode or

284
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:03,780
more simplified zombies mode for babies

285
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:09,720
for babies to play zombies really this

286
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,900
reveal was extremely disappointing it

287
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:16,080
just confirmed everybody's fears I think

288
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,760
they mentioned something like stories

289
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,709
for characters and you know maybe hold

290
00:13:19,709 --> 00:13:21,990
out hope for that but I don't know what

291
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:24,480
that's gonna translate into now

292
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,279
I dunno what that's gonna translate into

293
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:28,889
its I'll tell you what it is it's

294
00:13:28,889 --> 00:13:31,260
Rainbow six siege it's the single player

295
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:34,800
little little videos that you get with

296
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,990
this say this Rainbow six siege

297
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,670
characters all you get this little

298
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,649
cinematic to entry intro what they do

299
00:13:40,649 --> 00:13:42,660
and how they work and then you do a

300
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:45,029
single-player story which is really just

301
00:13:45,029 --> 00:13:47,579
a booking tutorial it's gonna be little

302
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:49,649
tutorials but you know how to play them

303
00:13:49,649 --> 00:13:51,750
in the fuckin multiplayer mode their

304
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,570
rainbow it is rainbow succeeds the more

305
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:56,699
I think about it the more I think about

306
00:13:56,699 --> 00:13:58,889
they've basically converted their game

307
00:13:58,889 --> 00:14:00,959
into rainbow succeeds with elements of

308
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,079
overwatch and throwing in battle royale

309
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,959
for fortnight this is not innovation

310
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,600
this is not innovation especially when

311
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,709
you're removing the campaign mode you

312
00:14:12,709 --> 00:14:16,170
how can you defend this you're blind

313
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:20,269
guys stop being blind it is ok to

314
00:14:20,269 --> 00:14:23,579
criticize this and see it for what it is

315
00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:25,589
I guarantee it's little stock videos

316
00:14:25,589 --> 00:14:28,199
little training missions and then you

317
00:14:28,199 --> 00:14:30,600
fucking you know buy new champions buy

318
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,870
new fucking huge operators if you're

319
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:37,260
super excited about this Call of Duty

320
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,660
about this particular version of black

321
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,880
ops I don't know if you were a real

322
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,190
black ops fan in the first place

323
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,569
I don't even know if you were a real

324
00:14:45,569 --> 00:14:49,199
Call of Duty fan you're a fortnight fan

325
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,540
or a pop G fan and now you're excited to

326
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,850
play this call of duty as you can tell

327
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:56,670
I'm not a fan of either of those games I

328
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:59,100
don't play them regularly and so I'm not

329
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:02,130
excited and we go from one zombie map to

330
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:06,360
three zombie maps angry Joe loves it is

331
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,680
this like they built the game

332
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,649
specifically for me could I need more

333
00:15:10,649 --> 00:15:14,670
zombies no man I know zombies mode is

334
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:17,730
popular but I I'm just not a huge fan of

335
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:20,160
it it's fun with friends for a little

336
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,959
bit but it's one of those kind of

337
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:24,449
additional things it has always been an

338
00:15:24,449 --> 00:15:27,029
additional icing on the cake and what

339
00:15:27,029 --> 00:15:28,769
they're doing is they're they're moving

340
00:15:28,769 --> 00:15:30,810
and saying that this is your main

341
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:33,060
content now here is your campaign

342
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:36,000
a the the additional zombies mode would

343
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,320
give you three more Maps here's your

344
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,660
campaign and let's focus on multiplayer

345
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,970
and let's focus on battle royale we

346
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:43,470
could have it all so we're getting less

347
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:46,530
for more guys call of duty black ops 4 I

348
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:51,210
hope other other studios and and

349
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:53,640
developers and publishers do not copy

350
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,820
this please do not copy this I don't I

351
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:00,000
honestly I don't know and I will reserve

352
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,700
judgment okay I will reserve judgment

353
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,580
for the actual game cuz if it's good

354
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:09,330
then okay but I'm telling you guys we've

355
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:12,330
predicted some some stinkers from call

356
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:14,610
of duty before and just because we're

357
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:19,650
we're getting hints Oh Oh full of shit

358
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:22,440
you know that's legitimate people can

359
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,480
share their opinions and I'm getting a

360
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,130
serious fall as my grandma would say you

361
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:34,050
know alright well I guess you know

362
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:35,220
what's interesting I think we're

363
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,990
actually gonna get a battlefield 5

364
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:42,360
reveal on May 23rd so oh my God if they

365
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,190
reveal a battle royale mode take out

366
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:46,710

367
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:49,350
Armageddon it will be Armageddon it will

368
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:52,440
be the end times can you just tell me

369
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,090
one thing I just realized at the

370
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:55,920
beginning of the conference for this

371
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:00,060
Call of Duty why if no single-player

372
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,700
campaign is the future and nobody plays

373
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,410
it anymore it's that which is wrong and

374
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:06,540
they're never gonna do it anymore then

375
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:09,030
why did they use so much footage of all

376
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:12,180
the previous campaigns and black ops and

377
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:14,360
