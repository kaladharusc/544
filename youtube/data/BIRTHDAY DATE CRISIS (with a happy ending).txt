00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:35,040
know what that means but he's like a

9
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,579
pretty serious guy eight miles at a 737

10
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:40,379
pace not bad not bad for a maintenance

11
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:42,230
run

the owner of juice press guy named

Marcus awesome guy he's a little bit of

15
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,629
an animal like he used to be you're

16
00:00:56,629 --> 00:00:58,670
still as a professional kickboxer Plager

17
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:00,320
he's been inviting me to go work out

18
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,450
with him for a while today's the day I'm

19
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:14,479
taking him up on that offer I hate to go

20
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,759
all Leonardo on you but I look after at

21
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:19,340
least mention the global warming crisis

22
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:21,920
is late October here in New York City

23
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,289
and it's about 85 degrees out today it's

lovely it's also terrifying

yeah I'm doing the real thing here your

27
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:53,960
your christening our healing space this

28
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,880
would be the first thing you can you can

29
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,950
come get a smoothie and worked out it's

30
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:00,229
a very special space we want to use the

31
00:02:00,229 --> 00:02:02,710
space for only those who really need it

32
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:05,539
or those people like yourself that can

33
00:02:05,539 --> 00:02:09,170
actually I'm not saying we really really

34
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,239
need it what are you saying about me

35
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:12,470
Marcus I mean I know I've put on like a

36
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:15,200
little bit of weight I don't mean it

37
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,269
like that I mean so the idea is there's

38
00:02:17,269 --> 00:02:19,220
no commercial enterprise here so the two

39
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:20,569
type of people that I want to use the

40
00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:22,850
space for people that are sick or

41
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,850
someone like yourself you're you're a

42
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:27,920
universal conduit for connecting people

43
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,110
in the world that you understand how how

44
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:32,660
much 20 I think I do understand so and

45
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,850
you can count on me I probably probably

46
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:37,989
need the 8 mile run this morning this is

47
00:02:37,989 --> 00:02:43,530
seems adequate

we just finished it finished with the

race around the block which I think

54
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,950
neither of us needed it's like we were

55
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:19,480
good before that race you should have

56
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,370
beat me by a lot more I'm like 20,000

57
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:23,170
years older than you and you're almost

laughs you Marcus you did but you should

59
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:27,850
have like nine lap me I'm like a hundred

60
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,500

00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:56,890
I guess

69
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:59,900
that was that was awesome this morning I

70
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,520
need more of that in my life

71
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,430
that woman Emily that trained us she was

72
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:07,370
or is a professional Thai boxer and I

73
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:08,870
used to train at the gym that she

74
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:11,300
teaches that so back when I was fighting

75
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,320
used to fight a lot with her she's

76
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,180
amazing to go from something that's like

77
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,340
really physical and macho and that's not

78
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,709
that macho to something super nerdy I

79
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:21,700
don't know that you care about this but

80
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,560
this is like a huge part of like the

81
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,580
really interesting aspect so heavy of

82
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:32,360
what I do which is like how to deal with

83
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,910
everything that I shoot all day every

84
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:40,280
day this super SuperDuper fancy set up

85
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,280
over my shoulder here mostly all this

86
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,290
does is play The Godfather 1 The

87
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:48,050
Godfather 2 on a perpetual loop but I

88
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:50,810
also use this to like catalogue all of

89
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:52,520
the stuff that I shoot to make these

90
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,130
videos not when you shoot a video every

91
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:57,380
single day you accumulate so much

92
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,620
footage and when I shoot in HD like this

93
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:03,950
in 1080 it's like 20 to 60 gigabytes a

94
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:06,440
day when I shoot in 4k which I seldom do

95
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,260
that's like 300 gigabytes a day this

96
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,880
white drive here is 24 terabytes

97
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,370
completely full this drive here 20

98
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:14,960
terabytes completely cool this drive

99
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,540
here 20 terabytes completely full what

100
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,910
am i excited about today this thing here

101
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:24,080
this is a 64 - there's a thousand

102
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,860
gigabytes in a terabyte so this is this

103
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:32,810
is 64 thousand gigabytes now one thing

104
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:35,080
that I am particularly proud of is how

105
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,550
meticulous the organization of all of my

106
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:39,770
footage is the reason why in these vlogs

107
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:41,780
I can like always cut back to old scenes

108
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,430
no matter how many years ago it might be

109
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:46,430
is because everything is organized to a

110
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,770
tee on these drives people always ask me

111
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,270
how I do that it's not that complicated

112
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,310
it's also not that interesting I just

113
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,020
have a system if you make videos you

114
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,790
know what to do all the footage you need

115
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:58,110
a system

116
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:00,970
before I draw up my system.out I just

117
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,710
want to share with you a friend of mine

118
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:03,760
great guy

119
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,040
huge vlogger daily vlogger and he

120
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,830
deletes all of his footage the minute he

121
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:13,630
clicks upload alright so here's my

122
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:14,920
system it sort of looks like this ready

123
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,930
I got my Drive so the drive is right

124
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:18,610
here and then in the drive I've got my

125
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:20,200
footage folder after the footage

126
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,450
everything's organized by year you pick

127
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:24,940
your year say you want to dive into 2015

128
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,470
you got your months here then you take

129
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:27,610
your month so you want to jump into

130
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:29,590
March and then you've got your days days

131
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:30,430
are right here

132
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,290
ah here's where it gets sort of

133
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:34,540
interesting click on March 3rd and March

134
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:37,390
3rd each camera that you captured on for

135
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,550
that specific day then when you click on

136
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,080
that camera all the files are just

137
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,790
dumped in there in chronological order

138
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:44,830
and that's sort of it it's super super

139
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:47,290
basic I even was like very insecure

140
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:49,570
about making this video because even

141
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:50,890
though I get asked about it on a weekly

142
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:53,620
basis that seems so boring and obvious

143
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,600
to me that I don't know why you would

144
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,970
think this is interesting if you didn't

145
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:59,980
think this was interesting I'm sorry

146
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,690
