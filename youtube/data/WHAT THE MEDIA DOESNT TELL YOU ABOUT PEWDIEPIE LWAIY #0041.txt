1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,400
Yes, there's a lot of memes on this channel. (We love your memes)

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,640
You laugh You lose, (original content)

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,260
it's about memes.

4
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:05,760
Pew News, (rip Gloria Borger)

5
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,240
it's about reporting on memes.

6
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,420
Meme Review, *clap clap*

7
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:10,230
reviewing memes.

8
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:11,880
But the finest

9
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,080
of them all,

10
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,120
the greatest,
the most grandiose

11
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,520
of them all

12
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,480
is the PewDiePie memes everybody.

13
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,380
That's right.

14
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,760
I'm talking of course about

15
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,220
YouTube's

16
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:24,560
favorite show,

17
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,960
LWIAY!
(accompanied by dramatic music)
(about like zonoon)(idk)

18
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:35,860
LWIAY intro-
?Leave your entries in the subreddit bros and i'll watch submissions in the next episode of LWIAY?

19
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:38,080
Flex tape can't fix his heart

20
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,060
when the real damage is on the inside

21
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:47,640
Well clearly it takes a lot of effort to get on the PewDiePie sub read everyone so honestly don't even try. (I tried once ):    )

22
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,820
It's impossible, now 'DATS ALOTTA DA-'' I love how this rebound- this flex meme...

23
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,340
rebounded.Everyone was like (mocking 9 year old's voice) 'Ah you're stealing Jontron's video'.

24
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:03,260
Oh why? Why are some meme bouncing back then if I just stole it? That's right!

25
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:07,360
You can't steal what other people steal from you-

26
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,100
you can't... (stop stealing!)

27
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:13,260
Steal. From me. And say. that I'm. S t e a l i n g. (can we copy strike this?)

28
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,900
Disgusting. I'm gonna report it to the meme police *dials 911*

29
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:23,240
if you guys don't watch out. Pewdiepie giving his last brofist before ending the channel. 20-  how do I even say that?

30
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,460
'two thousand three hundred eighty seven colorized'. More like

31
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:33,089
2019 polarized, don't worry about it. And yes, I know. I look good as an anime character.

32
00:01:33,089 --> 00:01:34,360
mhAhAhAHaha

33
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:38,940
See? This is what I'm telling you guys. I've been trying to tell you guys for so long

34
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:45,560
Yes, my girlfriend is- my fiance? Do I say fiance? My future wife is in fact

35
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,380
italiano. This is how she talks to me everytime.

36
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:50,040
(bad italian accent imitation in higher voice) Eh FÃ©lix

37
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,260
It isa not that are verry goood. You need to get the morre likes on this viideo.

38
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:57,780
Ask them to liike it right noww and hit the bell buttonn. (end accent)

39
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:04,160
Will eventually get to that point in a relationship where all she does is this; and I'll know exactly what she's talking about. (relationship goals!!)

40
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,680
Oh, it's one of these. Why am I wearing headphones meme?

41
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,490
'Dan'

42
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:10,660
'Dancer'

43
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:18,780
'Can' Then why are you posting here? You can't call something cancer if you are it yourself (yes they can), you can't-cer...

44
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:26,120
'cAn We CoPyStRiKe tHe GaMeThEoRiStS?!?' 'Yes, pewdiepie our chairs do do that'. I'm not even upset

45
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:31,080
I'm actually more aroused; very nice. But can you simultaneously

46
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:37,980
Whip and nae name (STOP) Matt Pat, huh? Answer me that one. Can you do this while simultaneously

47
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:41,120
Whipping and nae nae? I'll be waiting for your response.

48
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,220
(MatPat: I just simultaneously whipped and naE NAED!!!!!)

49
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,980
Matt Pat is trying to kill the planet.

50
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,140
Everyone knows you can't charge that much energy at once.

51
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:54,200
''Can someone please make a better version of 'Pewbunga'?&quot;

52
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,600
oH mAh gAh

53
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,260
ohhhuhhh

54
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,220
*Swedish gibberish*

55
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:58,900
click away

56
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,360
Ahh AHhahAH!

57
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,920
w00of w00of

58
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,840
That was close.

59
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:10,400
This is why I have my trusty (cocks gun) at hand at all times. If a meme is too powerful...

60
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,700
*pew* (cocks gun)

61
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,660
It needs to be destroyed.

62
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:20,800
Everyone commentin, so we can trick the YouTube review people that this is a family-friendly video. (Video still gets demonetized) Everyone comment:

63
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:26,700
'Wow, I really enjoyed watching this video with my son. We had a great time together.

64
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:33,280
Well, actually we never had this much quality time together. In fact, I do love my son right now.

65
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,720
In fact, I might just love him a little bit too much,'

66
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,720
bRoFiSt, damn (gets demonetized) that looks. Disgusting.

67
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:45,040
What are you cooking in your pan? Dyou not clean it in between what is all that white stuff, dude? (it's the remains of Swedish boys)

68
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:52,300
Disappointed, disgusting, repulsive but also 'Brrofiist!' Watching pirated movies be like...

69
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:58,500
'audio-video. Audio video. Video audio.' What a bad meme!

70
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:04,120
I-if 2018 memes can be summarized. It has to be with- like...

71
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:11,820
Just a text over anything. Anything! Just put a text over anything and it's a meme! If YouTube rewind doesn't feature

72
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:17,740
text layered memes. I just realize that's the way to kill a meme. When was its featured on YouTube rewind

73
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,560
HahAHAHA *CLAP CLAP*

74
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,180
'Is this 15,000 people?'

75
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:26,980
(mocking high voice) &quot;She was just joking about being oppressed outside. It was just a joke.&quot;

76
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:33,480
Wait for that response, by the way. I'm anticipating it. (imitating Tana mockingly) Guys! Obviously I don't want people to be opressed outside.

77
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:39,740
I just said it. I had joke because I love being oppressed outside. By the way, 15,000 people showed up. (stops imitating)

78
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:47,320
(chuckling) 'My name is Connor. Heh, oh god, it's coming back. It's back for vengeance'. Well, I really need to play that game...

79
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:53,120
But am I gonna!? But iMmA GoNnA? I hope there's some &quot;but am I gonna&quot; memes in there?

80
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,480
That would make me happy.

81
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:59,180
But then again you guys aren't that creative. 'What if Pewdiepie uploaded an uncut and unedited

82
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:04,460
version video and there was a contest to see who would come up with the best edit?'

83
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,580
*clap clap*

84
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,540
*clap clap*

85
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,620
(chuckling)

86
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:12,320
Finally! We have figured out a way so I can replace Brad 1 and Brad 2.

87
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,520
(little high pitched laugh)

88
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:20,049
I don't have to come up with my original content. Great! Now I don't even have to pay my editors anymore. *Brad 1 and Brad 2 are crying*

89
00:05:20,049 --> 00:05:25,520
(laughing) I can just like let my fans do it. This is great. I really like this idea!

90
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,280
(his voice fades) You said it first. Let it be known that you said it first.

91
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:35,720
Sive was always memeing. (imitates Sive mockingly) 'You need to pay me more oob boo doo boo doo boo dooo'

92
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,800
Oh, yeah?

93
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,880
'When you start bullying children and become leafy in order to avoid'

94
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,780
(barely audible because he's laughing) 'your testicle'

95
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:49,580
That was a clever meme actually; well done. The joke here is, of course, that I am leafy now.

96
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:54,320
I mean I do look better. There's no doubt about it. I sort of understand leafy now.

97
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:59,200
'They've make Jake Pauls roasts into a real thing.'

98
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,340
WAAAAALLLLMMAAAAAARRRT

99
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,960
Is that real? That's awesome.

100
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,720
(voice says the text bubble) Today we're gonna be diving into the future --  (pewds: hey, it's grandayy everybody) -of Fortnite

101
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:12,280
and see what developers are gonna be working on  for the next few months including yes; dragons in fortnite... (STOP)

102
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:16,080
(louder deafening music) Let's go, lose control. 3, 2, 1, drop it.

103
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:22,360
ALI-A intro (earrape = death) (Rip headphone users)

104
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:30,280
Another one. Damn! See? If I only- if only I invested in this meme stock, I would be a millionaire.

105
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:36,580
Plus, you know, I could use insider information because surely somehow, or I'm not taking credit okay,

106
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:43,120
but surely if I review a meme, there should be some killing of that meme so that I can sell off those memes-

107
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,120
Does this make any sense? (no.)

108
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,240
'All women...(light saber opening) are Queens!'

109
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:50,740
Yess!

110
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,320
(other voice talking) 'If she breathe... (light saber opening) she's a Thot!'

111
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:52,860
No!

112
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:56,220
(light saber opening) she's a THOOOAAAOOT!'

113
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:56,780
(mutters) Jesus Christ

114
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:01,520
(voice screaming angrily then light sabers touching)

115
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,580
QUEEN

116
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,920
THOOOT

117
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,600
QUEEN

118
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,540
THOOT

119
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,160

122
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,920
We didn't need the ear rappÃ©, but very good edit by the way.

123
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:20,120
A lot of- so-fyou- people do put s-s-so much effort into these dumbass things. That's what makes a meme beautiful.

124
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,660
Well done Joe average 2 2 1...

125
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:28,260
'Whether she's a queen or a thot, if she had headphones in, she's now deaf .'

126
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:31,060
Or if she know how to properly structure sentence. (Swedish boi roast)

127
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:35,070
She wouldn't be parted Jesus Christ. A lot of video memes. I like that.

128
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:45,460
Keep the video memes coming great job to whoever made this meme

129
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:51,040
Are these all the memes I reviewed? (tss)

130
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,480
Oh I see (chuckles)

131
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:58,120
(edna) 'So you don't know where he is...'

132
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:02,000
'Would you like to find out?'

133
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,120
Is that's supposed to be Mariza? (?)

134
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:17,900
(gay chuckle)

135
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:21,420
I'm never doing Pepe.

136
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:28,880
Pepe needs to live forever. He's far too important

137
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:37,200
BtHa ha ha ha ha

138
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,840
Oh, come on!- what?- I want- (chuckles loudly)

139
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,580
(more swedish chuckling)

140
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:46,740
That was- I was getting into it,! Can you make the whole- whole movie please? Just change the whole plot? (very chuckle worthy meme 10/10)

141
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:47,340
(chuckle)

142
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:51,200
'Woah, an whole article saying good things about Pewds? That's nice.' I did see that.

143
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,800
Thank you FragHero. Namaste, I think it's the only one that really ahh~

144
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,490
I've seen put ahhm~

145
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:02,700
Put emphasis on it. I mean, it's like every article ever. They mentioned me and they bring up all my bad past.

146
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:10,060
But they would never mention any of this. Because it doesn't fit to portray me as a somewhat decent character.

147
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:12,620
I bet Pewds is gonna love this tattoo

148
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:19,720
Well, I like Batman so that's cool. Oh, it's an okay sign didn't look. Thank you very much (comment &quot;rip&quot; if you fell for this)

149
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,120
I will pee through it. (wat)

150
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,680
(chuckles)

151
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:26,580
'Thank you bus driver,very cool!'

152
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:33,200
'Dr. Phil: I call it contentInator'. Oh, I'm sorry. I made three videos

153
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,400
You're all a bunch of cryyyybabies.

154
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,780
(imitates us whining) Wah, wah, wah, wah

155
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:42,500
I don't care! (fake menacing sound whilst showing teeths) HuuuuuuUU

156
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:48,580
(weird intonation) I'm not like those other youtubers who say they love their fans; super lame. I say: screw you fans!

157
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,720
(whispers) please like the video though, thank you (kiss)

158
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,820
'Epic Games thought Pewds was going to play fortnite (get ready cuz he's gonna start talking at god speed)so they made a custom banner for him that only he gets it if he ever plays'

159
00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:01,260
Is that true? Cuz I did play Fortnite once and I thought it was legitimately a fun cool game.

160
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:07,880
But my own pride came in between that (chuckling) it was so popular. Well, they're doing fine without me

161
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,900
I think they'll be all right. (laughs)

162
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,640
'Aww that's actually kind of nice'. Don't make me feel bad!!

163
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,860
(laughing)

164
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,320
Is it time? It's a time for me to play Fortnite? *does collab w/ Ali-A to get those views*

165
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,584
It's time for me to bite the bullet and bite my pride and my stubbornness-

166
00:10:20,584 --> 00:10:24,077
'Making an hour long video of quality content'

167
00:10:24,077 --> 00:10:27,777
'Making a 10 minute video about important matters'

168
00:10:27,777 --> 00:10:30,180
'Making a 10 minute video about memes'

169
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,500

170
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:37,140
'But get bored in the middle (laughing) and just ask Brad~'

171
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:44,300
'And Brad 2 to edit the shh out of it and add a minute of beans' (laughing)

172
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:50,500
'with music and a minute of ASS commercial to get to the 10 minute mark.' (Like if you watched until the end cuz i did :D )

173
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:55,410
'Felix has really outdone himself this time'. This is not true.

174
00:10:55,410 --> 00:11:00,029
Okay, you guys think you know me just because you presented through a meme?

175
00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:04,680
I mean I could just record an hour-long video quality content.

176
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:09,980
But am I gOnNA?! I don't think so. I upload every day. I'm sorry-y~

177
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:15,180
Sometimes I get really busy with other stuff and life comes up or whatever. I have other projects that

178
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:19,840
I'm working on in the background and sometimes I'm sad to say I don't have that much time to put on a videooo.

179
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:25,680
Eight years, every single day. Eight years, eight years everybody. I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

180
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,180
Now you (cocks gun) apologize!

181
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:31,960
Okay? I said sorry; you say sorry.

182
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,960
(loudly) Is this an outro?

183
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:40,320
Listen, it's a creative way to show the gameplay of Animal Super Squad, A.S.S., the greatest game of all time.

184
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,140

'When you're so poor in real life that even shadow rendering is set to low.'

When you're so poor in real life that you own an overly expensive laptop everybody.

209
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,780
Wow this meme made so much sense.

210
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:55,360
Meme correction! (claps twice) Do it right and do it again!

211
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:01,820
Okay,? Maybe put a bag of Lidl with a shadow on it or something. Jesus Christ y'all dumb... That's it!

212
