thank you

65
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:24,129
tell me I got this is the this is the new york times we released the Pokemon

66
00:05:24,129 --> 00:05:28,659
video yesterday it's doing really well I was like two million views I wanted to

67
00:05:28,659 --> 00:05:33,039
share with you some of the details behind making that video because I know

68
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:36,310
when I see videos like that on youtube like fun

69
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:43,030
short viral videos that I don't they seem so easy to make and yesterday was

70
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:48,190
anything but easy to realize like as you've seen in this video we had for

71
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:50,530
people with the rent a minivan

72
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:54,789
Sean like couldn't see anything inside of that Pikachu mass

73
00:05:54,789 --> 00:05:57,909
obviously we attracted a lot of attention from the police

74
00:05:57,909 --> 00:06:01,270
that's just what happens when you're riding around New York City Electric

75
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:06,849
skateboards dressed as a video game characters but i hope that this episode

76
00:06:06,849 --> 00:06:12,159
that shines a little light on on what it took to pull together that like three

77
00:06:12,159 --> 00:06:16,419
minute really fun video shows that like even when you're making something silly

78
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:21,639
something as stupid as like a Pokemon video that it still requires like an

79
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:26,469
insane amount of work and a lot of focus and like talented people and out of work

80
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:30,069
cameras and the cooperation of like an entire city

81
00:06:30,909 --> 00:06:34,839
ok I'll get back to the video now I'm just as I'm watching you act like this

82
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:38,349
narrative was missing like just how hard it was to pull that off

83
00:06:38,979 --> 00:06:42,009
what is this noise

84
00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:45,009
ok

85
00:06:46,689 --> 00:06:51,129
I hope that look like something that you i love you i definitely escape though I

86
00:06:51,129 --> 00:06:54,399
got to come on right so what we have different ideas people we just started

87
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:58,929
yelling instructions and all 100 of them to offer be heard the click there's a

88
00:06:58,929 --> 00:07:02,229
pointing to the choreography

89
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:21,820
and there goes deland

90
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,249
the good silver

91
00:07:26,249 --> 00:07:32,549
730 now I don't really know how it takes so long to food two minute video but

92
00:07:32,549 --> 00:07:33,809
we're almost done

93
00:07:33,809 --> 00:07:38,759
what's left there Sean app keeps crashing it's really sure on this behind

94
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:43,739
schedule so I think literally we need to work on three ice cream shop

95
00:07:43,739 --> 00:07:48,569
that's right we don't recognize her shop they're like when I kicked your stomach

96
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:53,279
yeah if you like Dennis kick my stomach you liked that didn't like it i said we

97
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:54,179
don't pull back

98
00:07:54,179 --> 00:07:57,479
oh I think that we should be like she's like this and then just pulled me out

99
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:02,579
and i like but you guys can get on the ground just like a douche beating me and

100
00:08:02,579 --> 00:08:06,659
then you kick my stomach and like like that and then I react but then I grab

101
00:08:06,659 --> 00:08:10,019
you and likes are more likely right yeah game of thrones stock fight you don't

102
00:08:10,019 --> 00:08:13,649

115
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:13,620
I would get this feeling at the end of a long shoot like that that the video is

116
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,760
