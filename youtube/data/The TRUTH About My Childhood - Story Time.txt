1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,639
this is a video I promised myself I

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:04,759
would make 10 years ago when my mom died

3
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:07,500
but I've waited to do it because I

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,900
wanted to let her rest I wanted it to

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,759
just kind of be over there were a lot of

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,670
people back home that remember her and I

7
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:16,680
did not want to crap all over that

8
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,550
memory but I think I've decided after

9
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,100
talking to you guys about it and talking

10
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,050
to myself about it quite a bit even

11
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:26,580
talking about my talking about it with

12
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,650
my therapist it's time I made this video

13
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,820
and released it into the world because

14
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:34,760
as I wanna get this stuff out of my head

15
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,410
and maybe move past it I want to tell

16
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:39,239
the whole story here but I think that

17
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:42,210
would take an hour or longer to tell so

18
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,219
I'm just gonna cut to some of the

19
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:46,200
highlights I'll use a few examples of

20
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,120
some of the worst abuse that I ever

21
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,800
dealt with and some of the worst things

22
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,870
we're going on in my home but I want you

23
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,460
to know that that just barely skims the

24
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,590
surface of the stuff that me my brother

25
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,390
and my sister went through this is just

26
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,239
a very small portion of it when I was

27
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,820
very young I would see my brother and my

28
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,299
sister get abused all the time I watched

29
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:08,100
my mom break my brother's nose once

30
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,780
because he got caught drinking

31
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,990
my sister referred to my mom as a witch

32
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,820
and she thought she said she was a bitch

33
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,880
so she literally stood on her chest all

34
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,369
250 pounds while I'm standing on my

35
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:23,340
ten-year-old sisters chest pouring joy

36
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,900
dish detergent into her face to try and

37
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,030
wash her mouth out with soap I watched

38
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,530
it happen it didn't happen to me very

39
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,990
often I was very lucky in that regard

40
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,030
the eight-year-old me 10 year old me

41
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,610
really never got hit very often I got

42
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:40,200
spanked I get slapped in the face a

43
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,759
little bit but nothing I would really

44
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,799
consider abuse just you know child

45
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:46,290
rearing at the time in the late 70s and

46
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:47,970
the reason for that is because mom had

47
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,290
felt she'd already screwed up my brother

48
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:50,759
and screwed up my sister and she had me

49
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:52,799
this late in life as she could because I

50
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,680
was the one that she was going to not

51
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,719
screw up so she tried her best not to

52
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:00,540
hurt me mentally physically she did a

53
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:03,149
very poor job of it but for the first 10

54
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:04,950
years or so I got pretty lucky but

55
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:05,939
eventually my brother went off to

56
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:08,129
college my sister continually ran away

57
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:09,780
she ran away at the age of 11 the age of

58
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,209
12 she had a family member trying to

59
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:13,260
adopt her

60
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,819
eventually mom just turned her over to

61
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:17,069
foster care to the child services and

62
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:19,860
just let her go and that left me alone

63
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,810
in the home and it just kind of went

64
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,579
downhill from there my dad ended up

65
00:02:23,579 --> 00:02:25,019
getting very very sick I talked about

66
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:26,670
this and draw my life he was an

67
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,980
alcoholic and he basically drank himself

68
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:32,610
into a stroke damaging his brain and he

69
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,730
was gone for about six months for

70
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:36,870
rehabilitation to try to relearn how to

71
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,819
speak and relearn how to walk and and

72
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:40,590
just eventually come back into our lives

73
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:43,140
as an invalid but soon after that

74
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,819
happened was the very very first time

75
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:48,030
mom lost her mind and beat me to near

76
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:50,370
death I slept in the same room as my mom

77
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,170
up until the age of like 14 and I slept

78
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,209
in the same bed as my mom until the age

79
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:56,159
of 11 I never really understood the

80
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:57,510
point of that I think was something

81
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,090
about my sister being dangerous or not

82
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,620
having enough space even though we had a

83
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,599
reasonably sized house with all these

84
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,340
empty rooms I remember they would never

85
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,230
properly heat the house so it was always

86
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:10,349
very cold in those rooms I I don't know

87
00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:11,549
him I think was just a product of the

88
00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:13,079
abuse I don't know I still don't

89
00:03:13,079 --> 00:03:14,519
understand that to this day I don't

90
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:15,930
remember what the argument was about I'm

91
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,329
sure I did something to upset her but

92
00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:20,609
rather than slap me or spank me she just

93
00:03:20,609 --> 00:03:22,230
hit me in the face with her fist and

94
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:25,139
then did it again and again and again

95
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:27,120
and I don't remember too terribly much

96
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,889
about that night because I it's one of

97
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:29,870
the very first times I ever

98
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,109
depersonalized

99
00:03:31,109 --> 00:03:33,599
or disassociated you know related to my

100
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,760
post-traumatic stress disorder

101
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,709
I do remember at some point I was in the

102
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:39,810
floor and she was kicking me and I

103
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:42,000
pulled my mattress off of my little twin

104
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,040
bed and pulled it on top of me so she

105
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,470
started stomping on top of that mattress

106
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:49,079
to try to damage me through it and then

107
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:50,790
eventually she just got tired and quit

108
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:54,120
and I laid there for I don't know how

109
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,040
long but eventually she came into the

110
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,199
room and said if you don't get up and

111
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:01,500
you don't move I will kill you so I got

112
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,690
up and I moved I don't really remember

113
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:05,310
what happened after that but pretty much

114
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:07,260
from that day forward that's how it went

115
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,780
every couple of days she was very easy

116
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,989
to anger very easy to upset and when she

117
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:14,729
became angry she used her fists or

118
00:04:14,729 --> 00:04:16,560
sometimes she used a bottle or sometimes

119
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,630
she used a knife or a fork or whatever

120
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,880
was handy she would throw heavy objects

121
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,400
at me she would crack me in the head

122
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,300
I've been hit in the head with a hammer

123
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,650
I've been hit in the head with a big

124
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:26,460
glass bottle

125
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,500
shattered over my head that stuff thrown

126
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,630
across me across the room it was it was

127
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,190
just pretty much a daily occurrence and

128
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:35,069
the bruises and the cuts and the scratch

129
00:04:35,069 --> 00:04:37,590
is just completely when ignored by the

130
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:39,300
folks at my high school I never really

131
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,449
understood how or why eventually I did

132
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:45,060
ask a teacher there and I asked them why

133
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,770
did that happen why did you guys not

134
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:47,940
know that was happening and they said

135
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,310
yes we knew what's happening we tried to

136
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:53,099
help as best we could I don't think they

137
00:04:53,099 --> 00:04:55,440
did a very good job but it's nice at

138
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,520
least no they were aware and that they

139
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,080
were trying to help one teacher in

140
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,490
particular was very useful I don't know

141
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:00,690
if she'll ever see this video but her

142
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:02,520
name is Miss wall and she introduced me

143
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,530
to the world of literature one day I was

144
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:05,820
in the library she picked up a book

145
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,889
called Stephen King's The Shining and

146
00:05:07,889 --> 00:05:09,180
said have you ever read this I said no

147
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,530
she goes it's an adult book I think

148
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:12,479
you'll really like it it's about the son

149
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,340
of an alcoholic and an abusive home I

150
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,020
think you might be able to relate to

151
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,570
that she was right I became a huge

152
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:19,949
Stephen King fan but she also introduced

153
00:05:19,949 --> 00:05:22,259
me to Kurt Vonnegut Douglas Adams a lot

154
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:24,509
of incredible stuff and I used books to

155
00:05:24,509 --> 00:05:26,220
escape what was going on the same way I

156
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,509
used video games and I could rarely

157
00:05:27,509 --> 00:05:29,250
afford to play one or get a hold of one

158
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,919
it really really helped she might very

159
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,840
well saved my life I think it was pretty

160
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,340
obvious that the school knew what was

161
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,810
going on though because one incident

162
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:39,479
actually happened on school grounds I

163
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:41,130
knew they were having financial trouble

164
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:42,960
and I must have been 14 at the time I

165
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,449
was in French club and we were going to

166
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:48,030
some sort of winery for like a day trip

167
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:50,849
but it was like 25 bucks is what yet

168
00:05:50,849 --> 00:05:52,710
needed to have to go he had to have a

169
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:54,449
permission slip signed and I knew mom

170
00:05:54,449 --> 00:05:55,560
didn't have very much money

171
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,719
so as we approached the school for me to

172
00:05:57,719 --> 00:05:59,789
be dropped off she seized that bus and

173
00:05:59,789 --> 00:06:01,169
seized kids from my class getting on and

174
00:06:01,169 --> 00:06:02,400
she goes oh is there a field trip today

175
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,800
I said yeah but I'm not going I'm just

176
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,210
staying at the library with the other

177
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:08,699
kids that can't afford to go and she

178
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:09,599
lost her mind

179
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:12,509
and she began to whip the car around and

180
00:06:12,509 --> 00:06:14,250
start driving to a bank just like now

181
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,449
I'm gonna be late for work and she

182
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:17,460
begins to while driving her car a

183
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,009
speeding down the road clawing at my

184
00:06:20,009 --> 00:06:22,289
face and I remember she caught my left

185
00:06:22,289 --> 00:06:24,180
eye just briefly scratching the cornea a

186
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:27,360
tiny little bit and I my brain just took

187
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,699
over that PTSD that fight-or-flight just

188
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:31,500
took over and we were doing 30 miles an

189
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,930
hour but I just opened the door to the

190
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:36,360
car and I got out and I hit the ground

191
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,979
and I rolled and I scratched up my

192
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:40,050
stomach and I scratched out my face and

193
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:41,430
little bit and I scratched up my arms

194
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:44,220
and legs and my principal and my teacher

195
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:47,479
and all the kids in my class saw that

196
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:51,210
happen and nothing really came of it I

197
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,729
never understood that that did force a

198
00:06:53,729 --> 00:06:55,639
school in putting us into therapy though

199
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:58,169
but I covered for my mom which is what I

200
00:06:58,169 --> 00:06:59,849
always did because it was very very

201
00:06:59,849 --> 00:07:03,210
scared of her I remember before walking

202
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:04,740
in to see the therapist I asked her what

203
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,180
do you want me to tell this therapist

204
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,500
because I want you to tell her the truth

205
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,780
and I said that you hit me and I don't

206
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,940
know why would I tell her that and she's

207
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,229
like no you tell her that you're a piece

208
00:07:13,229 --> 00:07:13,830
of garbage

209
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,330
you tell her you're a piece of shit

210
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:16,409
you're the worst thing that ever

211
00:07:16,409 --> 00:07:17,819
happened to me but let me tell you

212
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:19,289
whatever you tell her if she tries to

213
00:07:19,289 --> 00:07:21,360
take you out of this home I will kill

214
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,610
you and I will kill myself

215
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,699
so I did the smart thing I went in and I

216
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:29,190
lied because I knew mom was serious this

217
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,240
is a woman who had attempted suicide

218
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,400
several times this is a woman who'd

219
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,590
nearly killed me and my brother and my

220
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:37,500
sister several times she was crazy I

221
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,900
believed her so so I lied I lied through

222
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,789
my teeth earlier I mentioned her hitting

223
00:07:41,789 --> 00:07:43,020
me in the head with a hammer and I think

224
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,190
that's a story that you kind of have to

225
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:47,430
tell after dropping a bomb like that but

226
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,990
one day she'd become very very angry

227
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:50,789
with me this is I think when I was 16 or

228
00:07:50,789 --> 00:07:53,699
17 years old and I had a girlfriend I

229
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:54,779
went off to upper bound and made my

230
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:56,550
first girlfriend and my girlfriend was

231
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,110
very poor she didn't have a lot of money

232
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,449
she'd but she'd bought me a poster and I

233
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:02,159
put it up in my mom's room because I

234
00:08:02,159 --> 00:08:04,199
didn't have a room for myself I slept on

235
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:06,509
the couch in the living room but I'd put

236
00:08:06,509 --> 00:08:08,279
it up against the the bedroom door there

237
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:11,719
that's just shoddy wooden plywood board

238
00:08:11,719 --> 00:08:14,129
and I closed the door to get away from

239
00:08:14,129 --> 00:08:16,620
her and she began hammering through the

240
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:20,190
door similar to the shining I guess and

241
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,270
I realized that she was going to destroy

242
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,560
the poster because she's clearly

243
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,120
destroying the door the bitch was gonna

244
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,090
get damaged so I opened up the door she

245
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,830
blasted her way through and I fell to

246
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,900
the ground and I'll never remember this

247
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,279
look in her eye because she's holding

248
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:35,669
the hammer with the the heavy side first

249
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:38,640
and she does me this favor like thank

250
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,260
you for opening the door she turns to

251
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,539
hammer around and instead of hitting me

252
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:43,649
with the hard end which could easily

253
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:44,910
have cracked my skull she hit me with

254
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,589
the claw end which just kind of

255
00:08:46,589 --> 00:08:48,810
scratched the the scalp pretty hard and

256
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:51,060
caused me to bleed but she hit me a few

257
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,949
times with it and then just got bored

258
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:53,550
and

259
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:56,250
and left and yeah I don't remember much

260
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,560
about that mom was very dichotomous to

261
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,510
his abusive as she was to me and my

262
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:00,990
family

263
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:03,720
she still taught preschool she taught

264
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,269
headstart for 25 years she took care of

265
00:09:06,269 --> 00:09:08,100
all of these kids took good care of

266
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,440
these parents really helped those people

267
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,660
out and I think in part in her mind she

268
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,430
was trying to undo the damage that she

269
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:17,190
was doing to us when she wasn't crazy

270
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,560
she was a very very good person who did

271
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,600
very very good things and taught me very

272
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,670
very good lessons that I'll always be

273
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,829
grateful for the abuse did not

274
00:09:25,829 --> 00:09:28,040
invalidate who she was as a person and

275
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,140
and likewise the the good thing she did

276
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,760
didn't make up for the abuse she was

277
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,260
always trying to make up for the damage

278
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,420
that she had done to she often used food

279
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,070
with me

280
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:39,630
there were times where she would beat me

281
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:42,209
to near death and then take me to Pizza

282
00:09:42,209 --> 00:09:43,500
Hut right afterwards and I would sit

283
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,740
there eating a deep-dish pizza while

284
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,279
trying to smile and trying to enjoy it

285
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,200
because you know that's her doing her

286
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,089
best and I understood and appreciated

287
00:09:54,089 --> 00:09:56,579
that was her best and sometimes I would

288
00:09:56,579 --> 00:09:58,230
be sitting there with a wound that still

289
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:01,589
needed to be dressed and bleeding into

290
00:10:01,589 --> 00:10:03,990
my shirt but still eating pizza and

291
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:06,930
trying to smile and its bizarrely some

292
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:08,399
of those experiences going to show biz

293
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,070
Pizza going to chucky cheese some of my

294
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:13,529
favorite experiences but even even if I

295
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:14,850
got the hell beat out of me in the car

296
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,470
on the way there it wasn't until I was

297
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:18,180
25 and she made a confession to me that

298
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,430
I realized food was part of the abuse as

299
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:24,630
well because she she told me over my

300
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,910
birthday dinner that she fed me wrong on

301
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:29,370
purpose the plan was that if I had got

302
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:31,800
so fat and so unhealthy I would never

303
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,930
meet a girl I would never be able to

304
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:35,670
leave her that she wouldn't have to die

305
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:38,459
alone and that was the plan so she

306
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:40,380
always over fed me and always made sure

307
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,670
there's plenty of disgusting foods

308
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:44,399
around as a way to control me and to

309
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:45,990
keep me there and she was so frustrated

310
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:47,550
because I left anyway I've been gone for

311
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:51,329
six or seven years that point and her

312
00:10:51,329 --> 00:10:53,399
plan had failed and I think that's what

313
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:55,470
she was most remorseful for not that she

314
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:57,810
had you know done all that damage but

315
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:00,269
that I had left I went off to college at

316
00:11:00,269 --> 00:11:03,600
the age of 18 but a few months before I

317
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,450
left for college

318
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:08,450
mom hit me for the last time she never

319
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:09,170
hit me again

320
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:12,100
she raised her fist and I just naturally

321
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,750
reflexively grabbed her fists so she

322
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,280
reached in with the other one and I

323
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,630
grabbed that as well and I held her

324
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:20,180
hands in place and I realized that I had

325
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,430
maybe 150 pounds on this already very

326
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:25,100
