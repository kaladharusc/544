Sammy look look Sammy there's another

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:04,589
dog you should play the other no he's in

do you wanna be friends no Amy I love

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,800
seeing you actually socialize I'm really

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,990
proud of you this is the closest actual

8
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:20,279
socialization you've ever gotten with

9
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:21,020
another dog

10
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:24,420
good job what's up ladies and gentleman

11
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,310
of YouTube boogie2988 coming after lavas

12
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:27,930
getting to the power of the Internet and

13
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,130
yeah I know I'm kind of showing off

14
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,869
where I live right now which is never a

15
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:32,219
good idea but I've done it on YouTube so

16
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:33,690
many times I don't think it if you're

17
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:35,370
gonna come and bother me but I wanted to

18
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:36,960
show you this year's Halloween Haunt I

19
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,640
want to show you the yard and show you

20
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,780
what we've done and then show you the

21
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,700
really cool electronics we won't put out

22
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,920
till Halloween day we will do a

23
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,930
nighttime walkthrough but this is the

24
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:48,390
2018 hunt I'm really proud of it put a

25
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:49,530
lot of time and a lot of money into it

26
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,500
can we share with you so I have a couple

27
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,680
of really basic hangers these are just

28
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,329
dirt cheap and I like that guy over

29
00:00:57,329 --> 00:00:59,460
there though he's a little short but I

30
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:00,840
don't know kind of adds to the effect

31
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,000
put in red light bulbs into the

32
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,650
candelabras that look really cool I

33
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:07,740
found this I think at Big Lots so pretty

34
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,619
basic stuff got noises and animatronics

35
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:12,630
for when it gets triggered I don't know

36
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:13,890
how to trigger it though a lot of stuff

37
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:16,979
has animatronics but I don't know how to

38
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:20,790
get it to go off we have the howling dog

39
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,570
from last year and a few new tombstones

40
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:27,240
is what the yard looks like as you enter

41
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,070
it and I'm really impressed then as you

42
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:32,869
come in you'll see the full boneyard

43
00:01:32,869 --> 00:01:35,340
going for the full boneyard theme this

44
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,240
year I think it looks really awesome

45
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,630
well the ground breaker here the giant

46
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:44,670
tarantula including the r.i.p Terra

47
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,520
Rangeela tombstone behind her full

48
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,960
collection of new tombstones a lot of

49
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,880
these have lights built into them you

50
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,619
can't really see it until nighttime and

51
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:54,180
then of course there's lights hitting

52
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,509
the yard as well a few different bags of

53
00:01:57,509 --> 00:01:58,680
bones and if you notice I like to do

54
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,810
animal skeletons because they're a

55
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:01,950
little less creepy than regular

56
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,420
skeletons but there's still plenty of

57
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,960
regular skeletons - there's still three

58
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,160
pieces in the house that I'll show you

59
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,080
that aren't here yet this is what we

60
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,270
have so far is our first animatronic and

61
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,830
he is mostly broken

62
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:17,610
now doesn't work he had wings that flap

63
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,410
in the background I still makes his

64
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:21,030
noise and his mouth still moves his head

65
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,890
still moves a little bit but the wings

66
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,720
broke and now he just sounds really loud

67
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,220
couple more tombstones I couldn't get

68
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,980
stood up in the yard and then my ex-wife

69
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,950
had built this awesome pumpkin patch and

70
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,550
we leave it here

71
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,530
she still haunts this place a little bit

72
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,810
another hangar here and then one other

73
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:39,510
hangar this one is a little more

74
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,520
gruesome so I kind of hid it behind the

75
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,790
animatronic I don't know how I feel

76
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,830
about going gruesome and set a more

77
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:49,320
kid-friendly but this one was like a

78
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,670
spirit Hill Halloween fine

79
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,620
I'd like to find more like it but I

80
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,390
don't know the blood it's I don't feel

81
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,590
like my POA is eventually going to

82
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,420
complain so I should be careful with

83
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,880
that this guy I got to hang off of the

84
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,930
the water rafters this guy I got to hang

85
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:05,550
off the roof unfortunately he won't stay

86
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,890
up on the roof so I got him to hang here

87
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:09,810
on the door instead I think he looks

88
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:10,260
pretty good

89
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,290
then there's a few pieces of bones and

90
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:14,520
some more ground breakers here in the

91
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,040
garden including this like red strip

92
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,500
light that lines everything this is my

93
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,650
favorite pieces it's a skeleton dad or

94
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:25,620
mom holding its baby skeleton or maybe

95
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,060
it's just a ventriloquism Act I haven't

96
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,890
decided yet but there's a nice red light

97
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,390
that hits though tonight's super creepy

98
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:33,030
super terrifying few more little pieces

99
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:37,110
in the garden including some cats some

100
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:40,380
dogs some rats some frogs more zombie

101
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,690
groundbreakers and of course the

102
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,489
flamingos and the alligator hiding out

103
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:47,700
of the bush very cool stuff a lot of

104
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,730
this again lights up has animatronics we

105
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,650
have them turned off but of course it's

106
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:53,970
raining so much though the alligator's

107
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:55,739
mouth is now filled with water so I'm

108
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:57,950
sure he's broken by now

109
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:01,350
kind of a waste to do all that but one

110
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:04,350
more thing June so during the daytime

111
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:08,670
the skeletons look kind of cheesy I mean

112
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:11,130
this little short kid one you can see

113
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:12,780
the hook but at night you really can't

114
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,549
see the hook that he's standing up on

115
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:17,930
then we've got the big face on the tree

116
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:20,310
this is my favorite note if you can see

117
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:22,200
I'm sure you can't he's hung up by

118
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,539
fishing line but it looks like he's

119
00:04:24,539 --> 00:04:26,640
trying to flag down help because his

120
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,639
friend has passed out

121
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:29,139
drunk or maybe had a heart attack it's

122
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:30,960
funny because the skeleton might be dead

123
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,120
got probably a bit by that snake but

124
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,710
it's a skeleton skeletons can't die so I

125
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:40,270
don't know how that works out then here

126
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:42,879
is my favorite piece yes that is an

127
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:47,650
alien skeleton walking his dog and it's

128
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:50,650
a service dog how did an alien get a

129
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:53,159
service dog that doesn't make any sense

130
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:55,659
happy Halloween though the other garden

131
00:04:55,659 --> 00:04:59,529
has a little bit skulls groundbreakers

132
00:04:59,529 --> 00:05:00,849
other stuff going on

133
00:05:00,849 --> 00:05:02,710
one tombstone kind of hiding some of the

134
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,330
electronics there in the window I don't

135
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:06,250
know if you can see these at the daytime

136
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,120
hopefully I'll be able to show you a

137
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,680
night but enter at your if you dare and

138
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,900
no vacancy LED signs they look so good

139
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,210
at night and that no vacancy flickers on

140
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:19,060
and off really adds to the creepy effect

141
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:19,930
so I love it

142
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:22,270
as usual we decorated the mantle with a

143
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:24,969
few goofy things including throwing a

144
00:05:24,969 --> 00:05:27,159
nice shawl over the YouTube gold play

145
00:05:27,159 --> 00:05:29,620
button I love that effect you're a big

146
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,449
fan of my Halloween videos though you

147
00:05:31,449 --> 00:05:33,509
will recognize this dude from last year

148
00:05:33,509 --> 00:05:36,550
hang in the kid I guess not everybody's

149
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:38,680
seen this yet so let me show you how tin

150
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,990
action so he's got a little step try

151
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:44,020
here try me pad he's got a little step

152
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,330
pad on that you can hit but I will turn

153
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:48,750
him to be on full cycle the whole time

154
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,699
for Halloween night don't leave these

155
00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:52,960
out in the yard because they can get

156
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,550
water damage there put indoor slash

157
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:58,089
covered use but that's a really

158
00:05:58,089 --> 00:06:00,729
terrifying effect I love love this

159
00:06:00,729 --> 00:06:02,680
effect this guy saved us a lot of money

160
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,469
on candy last year so once you see his

161
00:06:05,469 --> 00:06:08,439
friend you'll understand I'm not giving

162
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:11,529
away any candy this year meat the

163
00:06:11,529 --> 00:06:14,710
smoldering pumpkin again standing at

164
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:18,520
nine foot tall like the boogeyman oh my

165
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,189
goodness he is massive and creepy no

166
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:22,509
look Pennywise has been here apparently

167
00:06:22,509 --> 00:06:25,599

168
00:06:25,599 --> 00:06:26,550
this guy

169
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:28,780
[Music]

170
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:31,280
now I don't know if you could see but

171
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,500
there is smoke coming out of his chest

172
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,270
it'll also come out of his head if you

173
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,539
run it all the way up there but look at

174
00:06:38,539 --> 00:06:42,110
this very creepy effect looks really

175
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,340
cool at night I can't wait to see him in

176
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:47,620
the yard yeah we get it dude you vape

177
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,370

178
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:51,949
Papa bless all right before the room

179
00:06:51,949 --> 00:06:54,680
fills completely with fog let me add a

180
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,229
little bit more fog this guy is new like

181
00:06:57,229 --> 00:06:58,880
200 bucks - for this guy but he's nice

182
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,340
and solid and stone-like and made of

183
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:04,250
resin he's really cool but he adds fog

184
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,270
to the room as well let me show you

185
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:08,529
watch

186
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:16,719
oh my god can you imagine that's setting

187
00:07:16,719 --> 00:07:18,369
in the front yard just spilling fog

188
00:07:18,369 --> 00:07:20,799
directly into the face of all the kids

189
00:07:20,799 --> 00:07:26,699
who want candy not today kids not today

190
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:30,009
and there's the full effect sound

191
00:07:30,009 --> 00:07:32,379
effects the whole nine yards pretty

192
00:07:32,379 --> 00:07:35,229
creepy I'm not gonna lie this fog is a

193
00:07:35,229 --> 00:07:36,759
little hard on the asthma so I'm gonna

194
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:39,129
cut but I'll be back I'll show you the

195
00:07:39,129 --> 00:07:43,359
yard at night and boom here's what it

196
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:46,029
looks like at night from the sidewalk

197
00:07:46,029 --> 00:07:47,799
and again keep in mind the big guys are

198
00:07:47,799 --> 00:07:49,119
still not out here so they will complete

199
00:07:49,119 --> 00:07:51,309
the effect the skeletons are just lit by

200
00:07:51,309 --> 00:07:55,059
the actual streetlights we have a little

201
00:07:55,059 --> 00:07:56,979
bit of light and not everything is

202
00:07:56,979 --> 00:07:59,769
turned on but I think it still has a

203
00:07:59,769 --> 00:08:05,049
really cool effect overall I feel like

204
00:08:05,049 --> 00:08:06,459
the camera is kind of blowing everything

205
00:08:06,459 --> 00:08:09,639
out but this is where it really shines

206
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:13,989
as you turn towards the front door see

207
00:08:13,989 --> 00:08:16,329
this spooky angel of death

208
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:20,169
the neon in the windows and the friendly

209
00:08:20,169 --> 00:08:22,839
pumpkins that lure you right to the very

210
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:28,839
front I love my yard this year and I

211

222
00:08:46,449 --> 00:08:48,519
now I know I've kind of given away my

223
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:50,649
personal information here I shared this

224
00:08:50,649 --> 00:08:52,569
video on YouTube so that you can see my

225
00:08:52,569 --> 00:08:54,189
yard without having to actually stop by

226
00:08:54,189 --> 00:08:55,809
if you ever in the Northwest Arkansas

227
00:08:55,809 --> 00:08:57,610
area and you want to take pictures of

228
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:59,559
the front yard feel free just know that

229
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:00,879
you can't knock on the front door it's

230
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:02,709
too scary the world is too crazy these

231
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,540
days you should never stalk in YouTube

232
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,009
or you should never stop by youtubers

233
00:09:06,009 --> 00:09:07,449
house because you generally can't get

234
00:09:07,449 --> 00:09:08,379
the experience that you would want

235
00:09:08,379 --> 00:09:09,759
though if you see him in a restaurant

236
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:11,319
you see me at Walmart you see me out

237
00:09:11,319 --> 00:09:12,939
into the world feel free to say hi

238
00:09:12,939 --> 00:09:14,230
that's why I go to these conventions

239
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:16,929
that's why I travel is to meet you just

240
00:09:16,929 --> 00:09:18,699
know the world's new crazy of a place to

241
00:09:18,699 --> 00:09:20,829
stop by my house so please don't

242
00:09:20,829 --> 00:09:22,480
unless it's Halloween night

243
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,920
and who knows you might be able to pick

244
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,029
up a piece of candy from one of my

245
00:09:25,029 --> 00:09:26,769

246
