the single-player and I played a little

21
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,379
bit of it gets a little repetitive

22
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:51,539
towards the end but hey that's kind of

23
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:54,570
icing on the cake thing so yeah I liked

24
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,640
