2
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,900
why does the cartoon version of the

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,280
house and the logo look so different

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,750
from the actual house it's a beautiful

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,730
house use that for your stencil why yes

6
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:16,049
this obviously well-off family with

7
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:17,609
1,600 kids has overdone it on the

8
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:19,050
Christmas lights thanks for noticing

9
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,520
McAllister's put lights on the trees

10
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,170
across the sidewalk surely prompting

11
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:23,519
lawsuits from the dozens of kids

12
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,210
dripping on the wires look I know it's

13
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:28,380
chaotic and all but you're telling me

14
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:29,519
not one of these kids are paying

15
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:30,750
attention to the uniformed police

16
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:31,920
officer in the middle of the entryway

17
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,510
did you by any chance pick up with a

18
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,340
voltage adapter thing no I didn't have

19
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,110
time to do that how am I supposed to

20
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:38,219
shave in France

21
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:39,629
Peter ignores thousands of years of

22
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:40,980
men's shaving with alternatives to

23
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,780
electric razors pick up those micro

24
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,340
machines that are all over in there

25
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,379
holy hell a film shoutout to micro

26
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:47,969
machines whose commercials are on record

27
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:49,320
as being one-third the inspiration for

28
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,480
cinemasins doop sends off your cactus

29
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,980
suitcase who the hell would let an

30
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,510
eight-year-old pack his own suitcase if

31
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:55,770
I did that when I was eight years old it

32
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:56,940
would have been full of only red vines

33
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,100
and comic books also Kevin later fakes a

34
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,510
giant Christmas party and creates a

35
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,010
torturous series of traps in his house

36
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:03,570
but packing a suitcase is just too

37
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:05,700
overwhelming well kids no parents

38
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,979
probably a fancy orphanage harry forgets

39
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:09,330
that he just saw a full-fledged adult

40
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:10,860
walk by and ignore him two minutes ago

41
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,650
you at the French call Liz incompetent

42
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,150
Angela clearly got ahold of an English

43
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,890
to French translation book but this is

44
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,180
the best insult she could come up with

45
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,799
she has something to drink he's gonna

46
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:21,900
wet the bed everyone is giving this poor

47
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,490
kid a massive amount of motivation to

48
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:24,960
wish to spend Christmas alone this

49
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,400
family makes the Tenenbaums look like

50
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,840
the severs this is an orgy of evidence

51
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,490
that this is a boy's room from the 90s

52
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,229
Michael Jordan poster check random

53
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:32,520
sports equipment plays perfectly on

54
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,420
shelf got it

55
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,579
poster of bikini babe definitely time of

56
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:37,229
your life board game you bet wait what

57
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:38,759
is it sure that French babes still

58
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:41,520
shaved up it's Sarah seest also is buzz

59
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,229
worried about he's 14 years old looks

60
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:44,610
like bit tannins a nerdy little brother

61
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:45,810
I don't think he'll be getting any

62
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,579
during his French holiday check it out

63
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:49,799
oh man Marley buzz who's window faces

64
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,270
Marley's house is fascinated to see a

65
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,740
dude that he's presumably noticed a

66
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,299
million times since living here because

67
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:55,649
we needed a quick way to introduce him

68
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:57,810
also you did not notice this from the

69
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,729
far side of the room no your soul family

70
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:02,369
half the people on this block how come

71
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:04,320
the cops don't arrest him no enough

72
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,630
evidence to keep it I realize this is 14

73
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:07,829
year old logic but do they really

74
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:09,119
believe this asshole killed his family

75
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,830
and half the block but there wasn't

76
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,330
enough evidence for conviction was

77
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:15,980
Johnny Cochran involved in this case

78
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,270
not only is this reckless driving it'll

79
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,590
definitely lead to the pizza toppings

80
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,330
getting all shifted to one side and then

81
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:22,920
there's a cheeseless side and everyone

82
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,330
suffers because this asshole didn't

83
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:25,290
notice a stop sign

84
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:26,760
little Nero's must have the fastest

85
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,530
pizza oven ever or at least pre make

86
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:29,850
pies with every possible topping

87
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,290
combination and make this arbitrary 20

88
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:33,180
minute self-imposed deadline also how

89
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,860
big can that delivery zone be like a

90
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,060
half mile or less from the parking lot

91
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,220
and while we have automatic timers for

92
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,780
our lights locks for our doors that's

93
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,980
about as well as anybody can do these

94
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,960
days right dude house alarm systems have

95
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,760
been around since the 1870s and you can

96
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,230
clearly afford one so that is not the

97
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:48,330
best you can do even in 1990 buzz is

98
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:49,680
cramming this mouth like a Neanderthal

99
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,750
here but a second later is eating pizza

100
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:52,680
like a normal human being

101
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,770
anyone order me plain cheese oh yeah we

102
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:58,200
did laughs you want a somebody's gonna

103
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,480
have to barf it all up cuz it's gone

104
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,100
what I had an older brother in real life

105
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,480
and he did plenty of older brother

106
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,160
things to me but even he thinks this

107
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,360
movie's older brother is about three

108
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,740
steps too far I'm starting to think that

109
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:08,940
fuller is going to pee on Kevin

110
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,350
intentionally which may be early signs

111
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:12,480
of Euro philia yeah it's a dick moon for

112
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,010
Kevin to tackle bus but why the hell

113
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:15,000
would they leave the tickets and

114
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,590
passports out on the counter right next

115
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,000
to all the milk these people deserve the

116
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,530
heartache of a missing child even though

117
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:20,820
Kevin's dad is concerned about the

118
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:21,780
safety of the plane tickets he

119
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,250
immediately discards one of the tickets

120
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,720
that just happens to be Kevin's at this

121
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,530
point I'm starting to think they

122
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:27,960
actively want to lose this kid

123
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,360
um still pizza most if not all the pizza

124
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,620
was unharmed by the spilled milk that

125
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,030
everyone freaked out over rather than

126
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,350
take the opportunity to come back to the

127
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:35,760
kitchen in case more the house harry is

128
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,020
apparently hanging out and shooting this

129
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,700
with the pizza guy at the entrance nice

130
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,580
tip thanks a lot thanks somewhere deep

131
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,720
in the Internet there must be some

132
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,430
erotic fan fiction about Kevin's mom and

133
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,020
the pizza delivery dude but I will not

134
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,880
ruin my childhood by googling it you pee

135
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,920
all over me fine we'll put him somewhere

136
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,280
else

137
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,600
Kevin's last-ditch attempt to avoid

138
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,100
being peed on is the main reason he's

139
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,510
forgotten in the morning McAllister's

140
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:56,190
elect to use their most terrifying santa

141
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,300
as the one that greets you at the front

142
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:57,750
door

143
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,580
this clock literally has battery backup

144
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,930
written on it but goes off immediately

145
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:03,090
when the power is knocked out set a

146
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:05,520
chair the transporter knocks repeatedly

147
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,380
on the door waking no one before decided

148
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,110
to try the much more effective doorbell

149
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:11,070
okay I'm willing to believe the power

150
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:12,270
outage would have led the parents to

151
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:14,520
oversleep but there are 15 people in

152
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,930
this house not one of them is a light

153
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,280
sleeper or an early riser

154
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,350
how fast is this thing go we needed

155
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:20,730
something besides sped up McCallister's

156
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,380

160
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:26,960
street doesn't get home alone by his

161
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,580
even though he's left the house maybe

162
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,870

163
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:34,669
to allow you buzz don't be a moron 9 10

164

165
00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:38,389
right number of kids but counts herself

166
00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:41,000
at number 3 and again at the end in

167
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,740
addition to the Murphy kid I'm surprised

168
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,300
Heather stellar counting skills didn't

169
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:47,319
lead to more kids being left behind

170
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:49,639
there's a huge amount of things to go

171
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:51,110
just perfectly for Kevin to be left

172
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:53,000
including the ability of all 11 kids to

173
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,319
utterly ignore this kid that's

174
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:55,789
announcing himself loudly by saying good

175
00:04:55,789 --> 00:04:57,050
bye to them there's no way on earth

176
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:59,210
we're gonna make this plain it leaves in

177
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:01,310
45 minutes Frank's an asshole but he's

178
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,020
right even with no traffic it'll still

179
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,310
take at least 30 minutes to get from

180
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:06,229
Winnetka to O'Hare and they are trying

181
00:05:06,229 --> 00:05:07,880
to make an international flight with 15

182
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,740
people did you count heads yes she did

183
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,419
instead of counting faces she counted

184
00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:12,830
heads leading to this entire movies

185
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,630
events amid heavy holiday hustle and

186
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,370
bustle the giant-ass McAllister clan is

187
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:17,570
able to run right through O'Hare Airport

188
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:19,550
without being slow flight counter woman

189
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:20,840
let's all the family members on the

190
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,130
plane without even glancing at their

191
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:23,810
tickets hope we didn't forget anything

192
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:25,250
Kevin apparently got into mom's valium

193
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,780
supply last night to be able to sleep

194
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,130
through the commotion of 14 raucous

195
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:29,240
people getting ready at the same time

196
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,639
American Airlines this movie is simply

197
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:32,930
expert at taking us through the whole

198
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:34,340
house and showing the props that Kevin

199
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,060
will later use

200
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,560
like the mannequin parts dammit I'm

201
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,669
taking us in off to celebrate this

202
00:05:37,669 --> 00:05:40,039
awesomeness cars yourself you didn't go

203
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:41,780
to the airport kids somehow didn't know

204
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,310
about the airport shuttles fine whatever

205
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,930
he's young but thinking the entire

206
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:46,370
extended family could fit in these two

207
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:48,229
cars that's a bad one Kevin unknowingly

208
00:05:48,229 --> 00:05:50,030
ingests a heavy stimulant and spends the

209
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:51,740
next several minutes tripping balls what

210
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,599
teenage boy keeps his porno mags right

211
00:05:53,599 --> 00:05:55,039
at the top of his footlocker your mom

212
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,509
will totally find that hide it under

213
00:05:56,509 --> 00:05:57,860
your filthy mattress like everyone else

214
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,570
future psychopath Kevin McCallister

215
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:01,190
stages a mass execution of beloved

216
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,960
sports figures what else can we be

217
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,490
forgetting Kevin's mom gets a lot of

218
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:06,050
blame for being a crappy parent which is

219
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:07,909
fair but let's not forget his dad it's

220
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,560
only 12:30 p.m. Central Time and they

221
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,060
probably only just flown over New York

222
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:12,680
but it's pitch dark outside this plane

223
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,180
because movie fur gets out of time so

224
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,740
okay there's no way in hell that Kevin

225
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,759
would be able to get from the top of the

226
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:17,870
stairs and out the front door without

227
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,099
stopping at the bottom of the staircase

228
00:06:19,099 --> 00:06:21,110
because he would just hit the floor but

229
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,610
even if that didn't stop him he would

230
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:23,930
run into a wall because the staircase

231
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:25,880
isn't in line with the door but even if

232
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,080
that didn't stop him he wouldn't get any

233
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,430
air coming out of the house because

234
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,810
there's nothing to lift him up when he

235
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:31,550
got to the first floor all in all this

236
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:32,719
is some serious bullsh

237
00:06:32,719 --> 00:06:35,539
okay asking this question kind of

238
00:06:35,539 --> 00:06:41,590
answers it to number 664 number 672

239
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:49,669
671 now forget this robbers knowledge of

240
00:06:49,669 --> 00:06:51,200
the neighborhood much more interested in

241
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,610
why these three neighbors all have their

242
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:54,230
outside lights time to come on 15

243
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:55,490
seconds apart from each other it's

244
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:56,630
almost like they knew someone would

245
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:58,130
later be narrating and timing their turn

246
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:03,050
on this wait up in car door wakes Kevin

247
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:04,280
up here but he couldn't hear his entire

248
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,639
family leaving this morning while Harry

249
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:09,560
and Marv have a bad habit of x+ near

250
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,120
windows kevin had to have supersonic

251
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,169
hearing to be able to tell what they

252
00:07:12,169 --> 00:07:16,040
said this is the third time I've been

253
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,389
tempted to remove a sin just for John

254
00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:18,889
Williams amazing score there are at

255
00:07:18,889 --> 00:07:20,419
least three themes that are all badass

256
00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:22,520
and it's for a Christmas comedy I'm

257
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,560
getting in kate harasses this one poor

258
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,120
french lady when there's an entire bank

259
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,700
of phones that could be stalking

260
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,020
American woman steps off plane in Paris

261
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,580
and puts American coin into pay phone

262
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:42,050
and guess what it works Kevin was just

263
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:42,950
looking all around when he was

264
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,270
announcing he wasn't afraid anymore

265
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,800
but somehow missed the old scary looking

266
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,240
man until it was comedic ly relevant

267
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,280
also if old man Marley was out about

268
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,990
since he lives next door shouldn't have

269
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,340
seen Harry and Marv just a few minutes

270
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,900
ago we eventually know Marley's a nice

271
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,490
guy and all but for now he'll just stand

272
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:56,990
there in silence terrifying a young boy

273
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:58,729
the memories of Kevin's horrific screams

274
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:00,020
will make him chuckle himself to sleep

275
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:02,570
that night Kevin screams so loud he

276
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:04,130
breaks the fourth wall didn't get

277
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:05,900
anybody I'm sorry Kate nothing but a

278
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,370
bunch answering machines if the phone

279
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:08,750
lines are down in their neighborhood how

280
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,800
was Leslie able to get to their

281
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,570
answering machines there's no one home

282
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:13,580
the house looks secure this asshole says

283
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,330
the house is secure

284
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:15,530
even though Kevin didn't lock the door

285
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:16,880
as he was running away from Marley

286
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,680
smells fishy this cop must be on cell

287
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,180
maroney's payroll or something what

288
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,190
clock was Chris Columbus using its 8:03

289
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:24,320
p.m. in Chicago when the cop comes over

290
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,330
which would be 3:00 a.m. Paris time but

291
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:27,590
it's broad ass daylight out here

292
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,060
emboldened woman gets out of the ticket

293
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,650
this officer was writing goes on a

294
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:32,089
vicious crime spree for the next seven

295
00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:35,060
days we're the Wet Bandits yes shake you

296
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:37,310
know that really see ransacking

297
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:38,719
someone's entire house is okay but

298
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,190
clogging their drains and leaving their

299
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:41,930
water running makes Harry sick sad no he

300
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:43,219
looked at me weird why would you run

301
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:44,600
well for a while you guys are acting

302
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,220
like you're about to abduct him maybe

303
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,529
one the church not calling it instead of

304
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:49,640
actually going into the church which is

305
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,440
much safer and requires less subterfuge

306
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,390
Kevin somehow finds an unused cloak and

307
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:54,620
uses that to ha

308
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,390
so we can see how clever he is I love

309
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:57,800
the attention to detail Kevin put into

310
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,880
the mannequins but is it really

311
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,350
necessary to put actual cards and poker

312
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:01,160
chips in front of them

313
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,690
Kevin had no idea when Harry and Marv

314
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:04,370
would be back right so he's been

315
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:05,660
puppeteering this Christmas party all

316
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,460
night in anticipation of their arrival I

317
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,200
admire his stamina but I don't know if

318
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,400
he can keep the charade up all night

319
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:10,790
long

320
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,080
given he'll have no idea if they drove

321
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,760
by or not you live in the most boring

322
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,800
Street in the United States of America

323
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,270
says the kid who claims a serial killer

324
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:18,020
lives next door

325
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,280
he took kid runs off thinking he's

326
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,810
getting shot at and never calls the cops

327
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,160
about the crazy man with the Tommy gun

328
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,780
that lives in the McCallister house it's

329
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,220
awesome that Kevin's adjusted to life on

330
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,630
his own and all but why would you have

331
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,220
this much laundry after two days by

332
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,840
himself right now looks like there's

333
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,810
nobody home last night the place is

334
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:34,400
jumping maybe everyone's hungover Harry

335
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,560
and can you keep it down earlier Kevin

336
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,670
decided to open the pack of firecrackers

337
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:39,620
he found in Buzz's root and put them in

338
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,240
this kitchen drawer because his ability

339
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,710
to predict what these burglars will do

340
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:44,120
was basically at a supernatural level

341
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,510
the kids there the parents got to be

342
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:49,520
he's home alone roll credits also on

343
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,630
what basis does Harry make this

344
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:52,400
assumption he saw a big party last night

345
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,200
and the lights came on when they tried

346
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,580
to break in the night before just

347
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:56,810
because he's seen this kid twice without

348
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:58,580
parents he knows he's by himself

349
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,800
welcome back about 9 o'clock luckily

350
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,570
Harry will loudly proclaim his plan for

351
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:04,010
all to hear and Kevin will happen to

352
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:05,480
open a goddamn window to listen to it

353
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,310
Jesus if we must have inspired the bull

354
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:08,840
that obi-wan what this is an attack of

355
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,750
the clowns forcible Claire netting you

356
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,000
can say alone when you see me and you

357
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,770
can stop being scary bastard how you

358
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:17,540
feel about your family is a complicated

359
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,280
thing rather than inquire as to why an

360
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,510
eight-year-old is wandering around on

361
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:21,740
Christmas Eve and attempting to help

362
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,570
Marly launches into his own bull sob

363
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:25,220
story basement you liked it

364
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:27,080
that's basement I don't care how mad I

365
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,660
was I talked to my dad especially around

366
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,640
the holidays except for that time that I

367
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,140
wish my entire family away other than

368
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,150
that totally open communication Kevin

369
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,770
cuts this extremely close waiting until

370
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,570
8:00 p.m. before even starting his plan

371
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:40,640
to horribly mutilated Harry also the

372
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,320
scheme heavily depends on two delinquent

373
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,210
burglars being perfectly punctual these

374
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,680
automatic lights are just coming on now

375
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,930
at 8:00 p.m. well after dark but earlier

376
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:49,520
Harry called them out as coming on well

377
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,560
before Kevin hid under the bed at 7:48

378
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,860
this is my house I have to defend sure

379
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,360
but you could also just call the goddamn

380
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,740
cops as soon as the robber show up

381
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,450
rather than design a saw like torture

382
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,190
house not only did Kevin have time to

383
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:02,930
develop this pain map in less than one

384
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:05,000
hour he found time to colorize it water

385
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,680
is poured on the sidewalk but Kevin is

386
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,329
out here in just a sweater so tightly

387
00:11:08,329 --> 00:11:09,709
likely this would freeze in time for

388
00:11:09,709 --> 00:11:11,179
Harry and Martha Sheila I know I'm

389
00:11:11,179 --> 00:11:12,920
hammering this home but seriously this

390
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,899
in preparation would take days not an

391
00:11:14,899 --> 00:11:17,089
hour Jesus Christ he's brought a zip

392
00:11:17,089 --> 00:11:18,589
line from the house to the tree that we

393
00:11:18,589 --> 00:11:20,360
later see can hold two grown men I had

394
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,069
to have taken at least 32 minutes and

395
00:11:22,069 --> 00:11:24,019
he's doing all this other boat what he's

396
00:11:24,019 --> 00:11:26,540
got time for mac and cheese now bull no

397
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,949
way all that it was done with three

398
00:11:27,949 --> 00:11:28,790
minutes to spare

399
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,410
idiot kid tries to eat mac and cheese

400
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:31,999
with a knife and fork why did the

401
00:11:31,999 --> 00:11:33,649
McCallister's have a doggy door there's

402
00:11:33,649 --> 00:11:35,029
no mention of a dog or cat throughout

403
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:36,379
this entire movie is its sole purpose

404
00:11:36,379 --> 00:11:37,910
shooting bad guys in the crotch with

405
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:40,699
biddies Oh at this point the burglar

406
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:41,929
should call the cops on this psychotic

407
00:11:41,929 --> 00:11:43,459
little bastard that openly rejoices

408
00:11:43,459 --> 00:11:45,170
after shooting people in the face also a

409
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:49,189
premature celebration and this has been

410
00:11:49,189 --> 00:11:51,199
Joe Pesci stunt doubles physical comedy

411
00:11:51,199 --> 00:11:52,999
hour thanks for coming join us next week

412
00:11:52,999 --> 00:11:54,589
for the Harrison Ford news stand in

413
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:56,629
special Kevin's Macau prediction relies

414
00:11:56,629 --> 00:11:58,100
not only on the fact that Marv would

415
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,269
pull this chain even though there's a

416
00:11:59,269 --> 00:12:00,920
light on behind him but that he would be

417
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,089
incapable of getting out of the way of

418
00:12:02,089 --> 00:12:03,739
the slowly falling iron it should be

419
00:12:03,739 --> 00:12:04,819
noted that Harry is breaking and

420
00:12:04,819 --> 00:12:06,319
entering in full view of the rest of the

421
00:12:06,319 --> 00:12:07,970
block which we've seen has several

422
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:09,499
parties going on you're telling me no

423
00:12:09,499 --> 00:12:10,759
one's outside on a smoke break and

424
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:12,019
notice the bad dude trying to break into

425
00:12:12,019 --> 00:12:12,679
the nice house

426
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:13,970
Harry puts his hand on the doorknob

427
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:15,919
sideways but when we see his hand after

428
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:17,689
shoving it in the snow the M is upright

429
00:12:17,689 --> 00:12:19,069
and not turning 90 degrees to the left

430
00:12:19,069 --> 00:12:20,629
not only does this not burn the house

431
00:12:20,629 --> 00:12:22,549
down why the McCallister's have an

432
00:12:22,549 --> 00:12:24,799
antique blowtorch and it works it's too

433
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:26,839
late for you kid we're already in the

434
00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:29,600
house we're gonna get you okay can't get

435
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,610
me like you've probably served hard time

436
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:33,199
and maybe even kill people before but

437
00:12:33,199 --> 00:12:34,699
wait till you witness the power of my

438
00:12:34,699 --> 00:12:36,559
feather fan kevin has a fascination with

439
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:38,389
feet but the angry kind he's kind of

440
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:40,040
like the bizarro Quentin Tarantino you

441
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,199
guys give up oh yeah thirsty for more

442
00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:43,819
Kevin McCallister could've called the

443
00:12:43,819 --> 00:12:45,230
cops several minutes ago but would like

444
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:47,059
to enact a few more acts of torment onto

445
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:53,809
these wretched bastards tomorrow royal

446
00:12:53,809 --> 00:12:56,089
who makes a hilariously specific threat

447
00:12:56,089 --> 00:12:56,480
like this

448
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,980
Kevin turns this impeccably designed

449
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,629
unholy house of pain into a damn

450
00:12:59,629 --> 00:13:01,249
footrace at the end got about a

451
00:13:01,249 --> 00:13:04,220
tarantula ex machina hey guys had Kevin

452
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,689
just run to the Murphy's house and left

453
00:13:05,689 --> 00:13:07,669
Marv and Harry up on the rope he'd have

454
00:13:07,669 --> 00:13:09,139
avoided in a dramatics when he got there

455
00:13:09,139 --> 00:13:10,819
but know this little asshole knows no

456
00:13:10,819 --> 00:13:12,499
mercy Jesus how long does it take these

457
00:13:12,499 --> 00:13:14,360
cops to respond since Kevin called them

458
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,739
we've been through the spider scene the

459
00:13:15,739 --> 00:13:17,569
treehouse thing the rope gag ran across

460
00:13:17,569 --> 00:13:19,069
the street through the capture and

461
00:13:19,069 --> 00:13:20,539
liberation of Kevin and now he's back

462
00:13:20,539 --> 00:13:21,740
home imagine it

463
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:29,150
were real emergency years we have

464
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:29,960
yourself a merry little Christmas

465
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,640
playing during emotional moment cliche

466
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,620
also we never see Kevin's actual bedroom

467
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,120
he's been sleeping in his parents room

468
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,650
this whole time given how much everyone

469
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:37,820
hated him at the beginning of the movie

470
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:38,990
and started I think his parents didn't

471
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:42,320
give him one that's ok keV you can

472
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,760
soothe your crushing disappointment by

473
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,960
reliving all the carnage you inflicted

474
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,610
last night wait you're telling me he

475
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:48,110
cleaned up everything from last night's

476
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:50,210
rampage no micromachines feathers paint

477
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:51,650
cans or broken Christmas ornaments

478
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:53,630
anywhere Jesus that's even more chilling

479
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,480
keV

480
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,440
it's pretty cool as you didn't burn the

481
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:57,980
place down

482
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,570

483
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:01,730
torch thing how did you guys get home oh

484

00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:06,410
we've arrived 30 seconds after your

487
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:08,210
arduous journey but instead of riding in

488
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:10,220

youngest child in the same bum used

492
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,120
Manor as one would regard an

493
