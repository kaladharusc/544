8
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:19,619
of hashed it out we realized we're sort

9
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:21,900
of the same person on on different sides

10
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,939
of the coin you know I mean he's smart

11
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:26,640

yeah and I'm sort of you know I don't

14
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,840
know what to call it just Joe Joe Joe

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,579
dude with the fucking camera lacks silly

16
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:40,739
and and thankfully a lot of you guys

17
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:43,590
support that allows me to go there so he

18
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,450
really respects that and he thinks it's

19
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:46,980
really cool the angry army and

20
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,260
everything so thank you for bringing me

21
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,960
out there and thank you to Nvidia as

22
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,059
well one of our sponsors for really

23
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:55,890
getting me in there so this is I gotta

24
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,629
tell you so I couldn't get into Sony I

25
00:00:57,629 --> 00:00:59,550
had to sneak in couldn't really get into

26
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,590
Microsoft because of that I bet you guys

27
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:04,080
know why I no longer have contacted

28
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,880
Microsoft it's sad

29
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,520
wonder it's sad because I used to be a

30
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,680
fanboy and they've completely sort of

31
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,020
stonewalled me in and I forget which PR

32
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,450
firm whole handles that but I'd like to

33
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,460
re-establish contact because I'm gonna

34
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,200
be talking about the games anyway but

35
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,930
artlessly whatever and this is why I

36
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:23,880
love our sponsor Nvidia that you could I

37
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,110
couldn't have asked for a better person

38
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:26,850
to work with because they also helped me

39
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,530
get into EA you know they should have

40
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,150
been talking about yeah I've been

41
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,920
keeping it real well they don't invite

42
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,390
me back or they don't want to pay for

43
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:35,579
anything right but how do you do that

44
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:38,670
you go to these guys and guess what

45
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,520
Nvidia does Nvidia pays for these events

46
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,490
and help sponsor EA and gets you know EA

47
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,259
goes and ask for sponsors to get these

48
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:48,030
different things and when you're working

49
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:50,970
with a company who those companies go to

50
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:53,399
for their games or their graphics they

51
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:55,079
can't say no they can't say no videos

52
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:56,460
like all right we want to bring some

53
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:08,310
people here so in case you're wondering

54
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,259
how I

55
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:11,120
you'll get access to these things I want

56
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,060
to thank our friends at Nvidia who keep

57
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,819
it real they know what the gamers are

58
00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:19,640
asking for and they want people in there

59
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,769
that are gonna give real feedback and

60
00:02:21,769 --> 00:02:22,760
not just kiss ass

61
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,860
and trust me I was there at EA and

62
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,799
Microsoft you know around their booths

63
00:02:27,799 --> 00:02:30,590
and around the PR stuff there is so much

64
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:33,230
ass kiss I know it's what I don't get in

65
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:35,299
there so I didn't get the into the

66
00:02:35,299 --> 00:02:38,180
conference but I did watch it you know

67
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:43,159
on the stream and with Jeff and so

68
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:47,090
here's the thing a lot better than I

69
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:47,780
expected

70
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,849
right yeah when they came out and there

71
00:02:49,849 --> 00:02:52,489
were like 50 games you know 18

72
00:02:52,489 --> 00:02:55,220
exclusives I was like okay we're in for

73
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,720
quite a ride they don't know what the

74
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,530
word exclusive means just like we have

75
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:02,930
one exciting but we're gonna call

76
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:05,810
everything else exclude three right well

77
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,579
it's because they play around with the

78
00:03:07,579 --> 00:03:09,500
terminology and this is why on Jeff's

79
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,139
show I was hard on on Microsoft service

80
00:03:12,139 --> 00:03:13,340
it was like what did you did you would

81
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,859
you think jaws like no not good at first

82
00:03:15,859 --> 00:03:17,269
I was like it's do-or-die time

83
00:03:17,269 --> 00:03:19,280
no no I'll put this up at the end of our

84
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,220
discussion here my time with Jeff but

85
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:25,099
and then when they came out I said no it

86
00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:28,669
wasn't good but that only really applied

87
00:03:28,669 --> 00:03:30,440
because in my head I was like all right

88
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,569
it's do-or-die time for first party

89
00:03:32,569 --> 00:03:35,510
stuff you really have to show us what is

90
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:38,120
the reason to buy an xbox what's the

91
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,000
reason to buy an xbox 1x you know I mean

92
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,099
and they didn't address that question at

93
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:45,319
all in fact it was a real port what did

94
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:47,359
what do they have they have what did

95
00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:49,069
they show what did you think they would

96
00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:50,660
show did you thought they would show

97
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,489
Halo and Gears what did they show

98
00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:57,799
hey little not even not even much of a

99
00:03:57,799 --> 00:03:59,900
low we have no fucking clue what halo

100
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,819
infinity and I said I said this too

101
00:04:01,819 --> 00:04:03,260
during the stream I brought it up

102
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,879
repeatedly I'm like not only did they

103
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,859
kind of just not give you any reason to

104
00:04:06,859 --> 00:04:09,349
buy a console every single one of their

105
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:11,479
exclusives is also on Windows 10 yeah

106
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:13,669
and then they don't even care it makes

107
00:04:13,669 --> 00:04:16,130
me laugh so much when they say the best

108
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:19,489
way to play is on Xbox one X to play

109
00:04:19,489 --> 00:04:21,959
this game and I'm like this is No

110
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:24,240
I'm like no the actual best way to play

111
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,690
is on a big-ass big rig gaming PC you

112
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:30,870
know like from origin or an Nvidia this

113
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,000
is that's actually the best way to play

114
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,759
right but ok fine when you get down to

115
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,220
consoles is it the best way to play on

116
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,979
consoles yes but that's a yes with an

117
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:45,180
asterisk for me because the graphic it's

118
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,789
so many SKUs that you're not gonna know

119
00:04:47,789 --> 00:04:50,370
and it blows me away that xmarks fanboys

120
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:52,770
I used to be one so I get to talk about

121
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:55,139
him like this thing is like the greatest

122
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:57,150
thing ever but it's not that doesn't

123
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,430
matter how many teraflops you have if

124
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:03,150
you don't have the games then what's the

125
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:03,509
point

126
00:05:03,509 --> 00:05:04,949
I mean there's also been cases where it

127
00:05:04,949 --> 00:05:06,479
sits back and forth - you know like

128
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,430
fallout for Xbox was technically more

129
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:11,880
powerful than ps4 ran it better so no

130
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,669
back and forth so doesn't even exactly

131
00:05:14,669 --> 00:05:17,490
we we we start with we start right away

132
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:19,289
with Halo infinite which has me

133
00:05:19,289 --> 00:05:22,949
concerned right if this was a big next

134
00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:24,690
big halo that everybody's gonna be

135
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:26,880
interested why do you start to show with

136
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,190
it instead of ending the show with it

137
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:31,320
maybe because it's too early and they

138
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,030
don't want to show too much so and they

139
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,250
wanted to start strong so that's that's

140
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,650
the excuse I made for them but I hope

141
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:42,740
this isn't a battle royale oh this isn't

142
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:46,349
a game but there has a new art style

143
00:05:46,349 --> 00:05:48,690
which I liked it looks to be going back

144
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:50,460
to their roots so I'll tell you what I

145
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,220
went from not excited at all about halo

146
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,680
6 and this is a nobody mentioned a low 6

147
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,020
that's a huge disappointment that no6

148
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:01,470
isn't there is halo infinite in halo 6

149
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:05,280
is halo 6 it's still coming you see all

150
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,409
these questions that's why I said no I

151
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:09,150
don't think it worked out Jeff you know

152
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:12,930
so it's too confusing but I am excited I

153
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,669
went from zero excitement in the Halo

154
00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:17,610
franchise to excited I'm gonna play

155
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,110
hello infinite and I think it's

156
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:20,849
hopefully it's gonna be good

157
00:06:20,849 --> 00:06:22,470
I'm actually more excited for angle

158
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:24,360
infinite than I am for halo say but it's

159
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:30,910
gonna be on PC

160
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:32,980
you know that's a low blow and it's one

161
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,360
that you could do for every single one

162
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,310
of these so don't we can't talk about no

163
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:37,870
here's the thing though and like I said

164
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:40,330
I said this too is like we you even said

165
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:41,710
it because it went from your YouTube

166
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:43,360
show into this conference and you were

167
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,770
like they need to do or die they need a

168
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:46,060
reason for people to turn on their

169
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,910
phones I'm not gonna turn my not and not

170
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:50,650
only that because I don't know how much

171
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:53,800
1s I'm not fucking playing 30fps I'm

172
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,510
gonna play PC a hundred percent of the

173
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,490
time or I have to go spend 400 bucks I

174
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:00,340
am I am so then we do or e2 which looks

175
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:04,090
amazing I really like oh yeah I want to

176
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,920
check it out - Jo let's play or E -

177
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,750
didn't play the first one first one I

178
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:11,100
think

179
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,900
okay so uh weren't we're in for that so

180
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,030
that's a strong point for Microsoft Halo

181
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:17,860
Infinite and got me interested or E -

182
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,750
beautiful but it's not one of those this

183
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,550
like system so you know anything like

184
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:24,040
that then they went with sec key roles

185
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:27,280
shadows die twice gameplay reveal so

186
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,430
this is good microsoft concentrated on

187
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:31,930
the games and that's what they needed to

188
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:35,440
do however is there a point where they

189
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,840
could do bad by concentrating on the

190
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,930
games and my answer is actually yes when

191
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:43,930
you have too many games to show off and

192
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:46,180
you don't show off enough of the ones

193
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,070
that are exciting and then you do a

194
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:52,090
sizzle reel where they go but there's

195
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:55,000
just too much so so I felt that that was

196
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,650
bloated in that way and they needed to

197
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,690
focus it down to the real big hitters

198
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:00,760
and show us more of the biggest on the

199
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,070
topic of Sakura - so I've been hoping

200
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:05,500
for blood-borne 2 for like four years

201
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,270
now and it's made by the same people so

202
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,710
yeah that people thought maybe this

203
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:11,110
would be blood it's from the it's from

204
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:12,880
software and we wanted another fromsoft

205
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,320
title and we wanted to get away from

206
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,150
Dark Souls but into another title that

207
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:18,070
plays similarly and I'm hoping that

208
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:22,210
secure is good you know it's crazy in

209
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,890
that weird that's we there better not be

210
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:27,100
no goddang microtransactions in this if

211
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,290
there is I like I'm not supporting you

212
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:33,520
fuck you guys for ya for going with

213
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,930
Activision cuz that's probably their

214
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:36,370
decision to go with Activision our

215
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:37,810
activism came and we're like we need to

216
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:40,180
get in on this fucking dark sword stuff

217
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:42,760
you know so we'll see we'll see is that

218
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,050
gonna ruin their vision I

219
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:46,630
think activision is maybe smart enough

220
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,970
now to not fuck with it because if

221
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:51,459
they're that stupid not to or anyway I

222
00:08:51,459 --> 00:08:53,709
mean have you seen destiny and Apollo

223
00:08:53,709 --> 00:08:57,250

224
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:00,640

228
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,459
correction they paid us a lot of money

229
00:09:09,459 --> 00:09:13,360

230
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,220

231
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,769

232
00:09:17,769 --> 00:09:22,120

283
00:11:25,459 --> 00:11:27,920

285
00:11:29,329 --> 00:11:30,920

and we'll see crackdown 3 I'm so like

291
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:48,070
this is a fucking joke Microsoft video

292
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:51,440
I'm so tired of talking about crackdown

293
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,050
3 doesn't even look like crackdown 3

294
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:55,639
anymore there's none of that destruction

295
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:57,889
that we've seen her and the mega Xbox

296
00:11:57,889 --> 00:11:58,940
fan boys all yours

297
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,709
it's in the multiplayer why don't you

298
00:12:00,709 --> 00:12:02,329
show me the multiplayer then why aren't

299
00:12:02,329 --> 00:12:04,069
you showing it if they shut the game off

300
00:12:04,069 --> 00:12:07,910
like three years ago how 13 they don't

301
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:13,850
leave the gate if they don't they've had

302
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:16,250
to redo the game so many times guys and

303
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:19,940
I'm telling you if it worked for Terry

304
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,500
Crews jump

305
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,500
yeah that was their saving grace yeah oh

306
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:29,149
my god this game oh it is now they

307
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:30,649
already show Terry Crews off last year

308
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:32,329
so it's kind of hard I was like really

309
00:12:32,329 --> 00:12:33,949
I'm not gonna be into you this year

310
00:12:33,949 --> 00:12:36,170
Terry but somehow this motherfucker

311
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:38,510
Terry Crews gets me excited and I was

312
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:39,589
like you know what that was a good

313
00:12:39,589 --> 00:12:41,740
trailer was funny it was interesting and

314
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:45,079
ok I'll play it but I saw a guy at

315
00:12:45,079 --> 00:12:45,920
Microsoft

316
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,230
like whoever create whoever said let's

317
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:50,389
get Terry Crews to be that that guy the

318
00:12:50,389 --> 00:12:52,519
main character there was more genius

319
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:54,260
because if you showing off

320
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:57,640
crackdown 3 at 2018 without Terry Crews

321
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,699
everybody would you would have heard

322
00:12:59,699 --> 00:13:01,829
collective sigh when the fucking thing

323
00:13:01,829 --> 00:13:04,529
came out but Terry somehow he says I

324
00:13:04,529 --> 00:13:06,119
mean it has this way to make you hyper

325
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,799
eighty I thought last year's trailer for

326
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:08,879
it was better though when they like

327
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:10,199
through that field truck through the

328
00:13:10,199 --> 00:13:12,089
skyscraper and all that other stuff but

329
00:13:12,089 --> 00:13:14,549
I don't know he kept it together so it's

330
00:13:14,549 --> 00:13:17,129
just it got delayed again so you know

331
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:21,809
then Nier automata automata is to xbox

332
00:13:21,809 --> 00:13:24,149
that's a that's a big thing for xbox

333
00:13:24,149 --> 00:13:26,459
bands because it was on PlayStation

334
00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:29,279
exclusive so this is starting to be some

335
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,139
of this xbox comeback and Xbox

336
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:33,629
rah-rah-rah right and I'll come back tax

337
00:13:33,629 --> 00:13:36,119
marks and and Durarara if they do a lot

338
00:13:36,119 --> 00:13:38,129
more of this kind of stuff so then we

339
00:13:38,129 --> 00:13:40,739
get Metro Exodus gameplay sort of reveal

340
00:13:40,739 --> 00:13:42,629
I'm glad they're putting these guys up

341
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:45,119
on the big stage because they're

342
00:13:45,119 --> 00:13:47,519
actually kind of a smaller devote well I

343
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,660
wouldn't say small but by comparison

344
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:53,730
Ukrainian I think developer and and you

345
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:56,189
don't this is because metro did so well

346
00:13:56,189 --> 00:13:58,169
they're getting the big stage they're

347
00:13:58,169 --> 00:14:00,269
getting the big time and I play the demo

348
00:14:00,269 --> 00:14:02,189
Joe it crashed three fucking different

349
00:14:02,189 --> 00:14:07,410
times on me at the voice actor but it

350
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:09,059
was real bad it was very but but

351
00:14:09,059 --> 00:14:10,559
everybody else I'll say this Joe

352
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:11,819
everybody else in front of they gonna be

353
00:14:11,819 --> 00:14:13,169
we're having a great time and then we're

354
00:14:13,169 --> 00:14:14,759
playing it was only me you might have

355
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:17,220
that luck yeah yeah it's Joe break dream

356
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,869
but it was only me it broke three

357
00:14:18,869 --> 00:14:20,579
different times but something that I

358
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:23,399
could notice that wasn't broken was the

359
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:26,910
voice acting was so bad so hokey so you

360
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,709
know when you have some of these teams

361
00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:32,369
in other regions they don't know or get

362
00:14:32,369 --> 00:14:35,039
into contact with the with the actual

363
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:36,839
voice acting teams that I guess were

364
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:39,269
used to so so the voice acting real bad

365
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:40,799
I'm gonna play this probably gonna play

366
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:42,089
this game in its native language what

367
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:43,529
they said you you could do you could do

368
00:14:43,529 --> 00:14:44,910
it in Russian you could do it in

369
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,889
subtitles and which sometimes you can do

370
00:14:46,889 --> 00:14:49,049
it in a lot of these these the southern

371
00:14:49,049 --> 00:14:51,419
language I think that's how I'm gonna do

372
00:14:51,419 --> 00:14:53,249
it but I did speak with the guy and he

373
00:14:53,249 --> 00:14:54,720
said there's a lot of placeholders here

374
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,879
Joe someplace I was like alright gonna

375
00:14:56,879 --> 00:14:58,319
be too hard on it did you play in the

376
00:14:58,319 --> 00:15:04,410
first two metros yeah yes so this one is

377
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:07,289
not an open-world what it is is you're

378
00:15:07,289 --> 00:15:08,909
going from region to region with the

379
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:10,439
Train once you get to this next region

380
00:15:10,439 --> 00:15:12,209
then you do we all explore and do all

381
00:15:12,209 --> 00:15:13,260
the shit that and

382
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,090
next one with the train and it's and so

383
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:16,520
we have different environments very

384
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,620
exciting all I wanted from this was

385
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,900
interesting creatures and that's what I

386
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,270
got I was on this fucking paddle which

387
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:26,040
by the way was the most frustrating

388
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,350
control scheme like I'm really worried

389
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:29,700
for this game guys from what I'm

390
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:33,090
actually played yeah but but the control

391
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:36,320
so bad but then these things come into

392
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,320
the softer way oh my god fuck and that

393
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,200
was like a mutant alligator it was I was

394
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:47,000
like yes okay please fix the game

395
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,380
Russian games tend to have they're

396
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,870
called beautiful train wrecks like look

397
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:53,340
at stalker stalker was one of the most

398
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,020
buggy games in the world when it came

399
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:58,590
out it was fantastic only a mother could

400
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,870
love your kind of face sometimes some of

401
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:03,510
the face facial animations weren't that

402
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:05,310
great but you know what this is a this

403
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:06,960
is a studio they're coming up they're

404
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,790
getting more and more budget they're

405
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,770
getting more and more recognition and I

406
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,650
wanted to do well so this thing can go

407
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:15,720
into the stratosphere but I'm so excited

408
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,490
and then Kingdom Hearts first time ever

409
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:19,440
on Xbox so they were real happy about

410
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,220
that more Xbox Rara right they did the

411
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:27,060
frozen reveal kind of stuff it's just it

412
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:27,990
was weird that there was a lot of

413
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:29,700
missing sound effects in this particular

414
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,560
trade you notice that housing just the

415
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,300
voices and it was like shit going on it

416
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,310
was dead silent you're like Hello that's

417
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:37,200
why I made a name the heart it looks so

418
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,810
bad because yeah and it made that

419
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:41,340
melodramatic garbage boys I mean even

420
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,500
worse because it's like that's all to

421
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:52,800
get the heart I know my heart in heart

422
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:57,060
that's amazing you can control ice

423
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,600
control it

424
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:04,209
no all I ever do is hurt people I won't

425
00:17:04,209 --> 00:17:07,030
hurt people no no do you all I do is

426
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:07,600
hurt people

427
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,600
no it was like there's like no ambience

428
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:14,740
that's what I said sound effects yeah

429
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:17,709
anyways so so that was good for them we

430
00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:20,350
have a lot to go through with with with

431
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:23,140
Xbox so see if thieves are coming with

432
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,329
two expansions for me how much you

433
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:26,890
release the game interesting from the

434
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:28,299
beginning instead of turning every

435
00:17:28,299 --> 00:17:29,679
fucking game into an early access

436
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,320
platform fuck ah so they're adding AI

437
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,240
ships which is something that should

438
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,440
have been in here everybody was like oh

439
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,730
it's gonna be so good I was like fuck

440
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:40,600
you I already paid down with this speed

441
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,600
just a lot of people yeah so you're

442
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,280
developing for a smaller and smaller

443
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,799
user man don't do that stuff like we

444
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:49,600
don't reward that behavior so I'm not

445
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,450
going back until like 2 more years or

446
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:54,340
whatever I'm not you know what see it

447
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:58,570
thieves - yeah we'll see you guys do see

448
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:00,220
them thieves - we'll be a bank you're

449
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,780
not convincing us with all these little

450
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,860
dink and dunks here and there no thanks

451
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:08,260
battlefield 5 war story teaser tip

452
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:11,940
nothing no it did the game a disservice

453
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,630
disappointed they didn't show anything

454
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:17,530
else yeah what is what is EA's major

455
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:18,970
problem they know they're having an

456
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:20,559
issue because some of their some of the

457
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:23,380
fanboys and you know people want

458
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,330
historical accuracy you're mixing that

459
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:26,890
in with red hats you're mixing in with

460
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:28,600
trolls but there are some legitimate

461
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,950
people in there that just want

462
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:31,870
historically accurate war - and they're

463
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:34,270
not you know sexist or racist or

464
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:36,549
anything like that you know and and EA

465
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:38,799
and what I'm saying is a is dropping the

466
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,080
fucking ball on showing this game off

467
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,150
the way it should be shown off to

468
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:44,830
convince those people that yeah it's not

469
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,540
historically accurate but this is one of

470
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,980
the best battlefields that we've ever

471
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:50,919
made and that's I'm telling you it is

472
00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:52,419
one of the best battlefields they've

473
00:18:52,419 --> 00:18:54,309
ever made and I don't give a shit if

474
00:18:54,309 --> 00:18:57,370
there's a woman over here screaming her

475
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,250
heart out because she's about to die and

476
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:02,500
bloody screams you know I could deal

477
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,430
with that

478
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:04,990
deal for me I think playing devil's

479
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:07,360
advocate like most people don't care

480
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,280
that there's women in the game most

481
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,020
people for an obscene are pissed that

482
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,520
they added them to like the British side

483
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,810
and not the Russian side because the

484
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:15,880
Russians had bad ass fucking women in

485
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,280
World War two they had crazy no most of

486
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,960
you most of the people complaining

487
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,040
they're just complaining that there's

488
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,420
work out on the game because it's not

489
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,950
historically accurate then there's a

490
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:25,930
subset that said all we want in story a

491
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:27,430
great but only put it in the Russian but

492
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:29,830
that is like point.this percent of this

493
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:32,320
percent of this offshoot no fuck it all

494
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,480
those complaining just here's the thing

495
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,450
game you just shut up play the game I

496
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:39,370
know that might hurt your feelings but

497
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:40,990
I'll give you some great alternatives

498
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:43,300
post scriptum is this historically

499
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:46,240
accurate game that I'm telling you might

500
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,760
be better than battlefield 5 in some

501
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,650
ways makes no sense cuz it's only like

502
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:53,890
eight developers but but just the voice

503
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:56,770
chat the communications the ambiance the

504
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:59,530
sounds you're gonna have a great time in

505
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:01,990
that historically accurate and then once

506
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:02,980
you want to take a break from

507
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,480
historically accurate come and play

508
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,100
battlefield 5 because you're gonna have

509
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,950
an amazing time I fucking parent trooper

510
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:12,570
down right on top of them an objective

511
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:16,030
five freaking guys and I found like a

512
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:18,370
freaking badass so that's the thing is

513
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:19,990
like the gameplay a lot of people were

514
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:21,430
streaming the gameplay from the booths

515
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:22,780
and stuff that they were playing and

516
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,490
they were live-streaming it and it

517
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:28,750
looked fucking amazing yeah what's going

518
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:29,920
on with the vehicles you need show me

519
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,540
more of the vehicles cuz I don't want

520
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,590
the vehicles to be like sort of

521
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:34,690
power-ups or or you know okay I want it

522
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:37,990
to be like battlefield 4 and 3 yeah all

523
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:40,540
right poor shit they revealed those been

524
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:49,780
riding e8 and they just added a press

525
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,670
conference show not this conference they

526
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:53,860
didn't show it there but yes they had a

527
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:57,280
battery so for aya Forza horizon for was

528
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,280
the next big Xbox exclusive it's in

529
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:04,030
Britain now and yeah I'm big into cars

530
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:06,820
but but even I have limited excitement

531
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:09,040
in into the forces at this point we've

532
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,860
got multiple sequels Britain countryside

533
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,690
if you really know Britain the roads are

534
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:14,680
fucking shit

535
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,210
it sounds really kind of not a good

536
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:18,370
place to drive your exotic cars around

537
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:21,040
in the countryside it's not but but

538
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,450
they're gonna make it work though

539
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:27,100
they're gonna make it worth making and

540
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:31,630
so so yeah I play it and you interested

541
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:32,860
in it but what I was really excited

542
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:36,100
about is this xbox game pass same day

543
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,140
thing this and we'll talk about this

544
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,720
this is one of the highlights to me is

545
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,740
that the Xbox game past $9.99 a month

546
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:48,430
right and you they're adding more and

547
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:50,470
more games to it and day and date

548
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:52,750
brand-new titles we should have done

549
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,600
with this with sea of thieves I paid $60

550
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,920
for $0 completely ripped off you could

551
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:03,430
buy game pass play cancel game pass and

552
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:06,670
only have spent 10 bucks you know there

553
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:08,500
was actually when they came out game

554
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,360
cast game pass was new you get it for a

555
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:10,780
buck

556
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,700
shit for your first so you could I got

557
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,740
see if these for a dollar but and in

558
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,210
this case you could do the same thing

559
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:18,280
with Forza horizon for if you're not a

560
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,380
racer and you don't think this is really

561
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,940
gonna hold you over for a long time but

562
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,980
you just want to try it out Xbox game

563
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:26,590
past $9.99 play it as much as you want

564
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:28,240
then cancel it I think like when you

565
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,480
cancel it you lose access to all your

566
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,760
but you just play it until then and I

567
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,730
think I mean I hate subscription

568
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,650
services but I'm starting to get come

569
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:40,810
convinced by this if they start

570
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:43,690
releasing day and date brand-new titles

571
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:49,540
to this thing I might get rid of I don't

572
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:55,180
know I might actually buy into this $120

573
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,880
right that's to video games so if all is

574
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,190
so if you played Forza if you played the

575
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:01,840
halo if you play Gears

576
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,270
if you played another one for for the

577
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:06,610
price of two now you're really starting

578
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:09,160
to convince me yeah and you have all

579
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,290
this backlog they added they announced

580
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:13,330
we're adding our fallout we're adding

581
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:14,740
this we're adding

582
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,840
you need the credit where credit's due

583
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:19,780
origin started it with EA access look EA

584
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:22,030
did with origin origin access the same

585
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:24,760
thing they yeah thousands gives super

586
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,490
successful and I could see why it was

587
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:30,760
and now it's called EA basic $4.99 vs EA

588
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,400
premier which I looked it up is $14.99

589
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,770
so of course EA is fucking asking more

590
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:37,720
even though right now they might have

591
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,520
fewer titles or less titles what they're

592
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,720
always adding more to it

593
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,320
so $9.99 plus $14.99 now you're asking

594
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,880
us to you know when you combine

595
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,340
everything together $25 a month now it's

596
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,320
starting to get off shit are we gonna be

597
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,510
able to do all these individuals so

598
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:54,490
that's the danger with this cuz if Sony

599
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:57,340
does one Nintendo does one EA does one

600
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:02,559
yeah now you're fucked okay so that the

601
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,990
market only can handle so many of these

602
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:06,400
Xbox game pass

603
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,000
type things but yeah so then we'll go on

604
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,160
and well I'm gonna start rushing through

605
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,740
some of this we happy few this should be

606
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:17,620
out by now I've lost interest publishers

607
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,420
with a trailer that's complete bullshit

608
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,559
the game doesn't look like that

609
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,630
definitely like that it's not exciting

610
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:25,630
it's not exclusively it's not they

611
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,550
called it exclusive it's completely

612
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:29,050
staged to make it out to be something

613
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,940
it's not however the reason why it looks

614
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:31,900
so different is because they were

615
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:34,150
showing off war mode and new ways to

616
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:36,210
play with new environments coming winter

617
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:39,100
2018 why do we not have that kind of

618
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:41,080
stuff by now you're making dirty money

619
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,030
you've been out for a long-ass time so

620
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:44,710
they didn't mention that it runs like 20

621
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:46,179
FPS on the consoles and they need to

622
00:24:46,179 --> 00:24:48,490
work on that yeah come on now bubsy

623
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:51,250
you're embarrassing yourself Tales of

624
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:54,970
Vesperia it's a remaster okay division 2

625
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:56,920
we'll talk about that in the Ubisoft 1

626
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:00,850
Air Force One is down its loot and they

627
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:03,880
do this annoying fake let's play I'm

628
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,420
tired

629
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,790
keep doing that it's so stupid don't you

630
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:08,410
tell right now me something if it's

631
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:10,300
cringe and it looks dumb makes your game

632
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,190
look worse it makes your game look like

633
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:14,650
people have to fake to have fun with

634
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:17,320
your game so what you do is just play

635
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,270
the fucking game have four players and

636
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:21,670
have one narrator a developer saying

637
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:23,169
this is what this guys doing right now

638
00:25:23,169 --> 00:25:25,540
here's where we going right now oh did

639
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,919
you just see what happened what he did

640
00:25:26,919 --> 00:25:27,820
is he threw her nade

641
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:30,940
the other guy that kind of stuff so my

642
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:33,790
opinion on division 2 it's you know I'm

643
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:35,920
talking about in an ubisoft but they

644
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,770
showed it off on xbox its multi-platform

645
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:41,500
a lot of these things are the game pass

646
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,900
there you're gonna get Forza horizon for

647
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,780

so well game pass on peace yes it works

655
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:06,070
on PC game good then they showed a tons

656
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:07,600
of flashes of indie games because we

657
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,950
have 50 games to get through on him and

658
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:10,720
we go through all this shit I couldn't

659
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,370
see them also see that does a disservice

660
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:14,800
to a lot of those shadow of Tomb Raider

661
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,210

664
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:24,280
everybody thinks an escape session it's

665
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,290
a Kickstarter that only made 30,000

666
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:28,360
maybe 60,000 Microsoft picked it I'll

667
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,890
put it on the big stage as if it's one

668
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:31,360
of their big ones where the fuck were

this and they gave a lot of stage time -

706
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:12,190
it'll be a sign - so that's cool

707
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:15,700

709

on everything you turn during the

713
00:28:38,679 --> 00:28:42,100

714
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,530

00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:53,429
Xbox that ps4 it looks gonna probably be

767
00:30:53,429 --> 00:30:56,429
best on the foot on the PC but anyways

768
00:30:56,429 --> 00:31:00,799
so there was that then we got just gears

769
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:04,440
but it was pop mobile that made people

770
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:08,940
hurt yeah everybody was like yeah dead

771
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:11,820
silent little pop figures these things

772
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:15,600
are so popular and and we're tapping

773
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,549
into that a little bit with our

774
00:31:17,549 --> 00:31:20,580
miniatures game I guess but I don't find

775
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:24,179
the Funko one's cute you know a little

776
00:31:24,179 --> 00:31:26,039
energized yeah I've seen I've seen

777
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:27,509
people collected like I collect board

778
00:31:27,509 --> 00:31:28,980
games they collect that I'm just not

779
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,749
into a man I understand it because I'm

780
00:31:30,749 --> 00:31:32,519
collecting a little street fighter you

781
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:34,379
know and I want everybody to buy that so

782
00:31:34,379 --> 00:31:36,240
I understand it but that's not all the

783
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,409
people who are wanting it's not where

784
00:31:37,409 --> 00:31:38,940
they were and you don't lead with that

785
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:42,179
you say here's Gears 5 oh yeah and while

786
00:31:42,179 --> 00:31:43,740
you wait for Gears 5 here's a little

787
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:46,019
mobile game here's another little RTS

788
00:31:46,019 --> 00:31:47,450
because that's what they announced in

789
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:51,119
Gears tactics better squad it's gonna be

790
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:53,940
a completely new squad it's a prequel so

791
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,200
I'm kind of interested in what happened

792
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:55,740
and there's a mer

793
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:59,610
day and before that and turn-based but

794
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:01,200
with faster gameplay so we're talking

795
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,710
XCOM but with the gear spin and faster

796
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:06,240
yeah I don't know how they're gonna do

797
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,860
it but that one I'm interested in

798
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:10,440
here's five they stop calling it years

799
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:14,070
of wars just gears gears yeah I think

800
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:15,870
yours is suffering from the same thing

801
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:17,760
like Call of Duty on screen does like

802
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:18,900
you just at this point you're like

803
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:21,540
trailer gameplay 2019 I don't care is

804
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:24,660
that because I'm not an Xbox family but

805
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:27,090
even when I was an Xbox fanboy when I

806
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:28,830
was doing Gears videos and you can watch

807
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:31,890
them really really bad I I was like

808
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:33,420
yours is cool but like it's not like

809
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:36,360
yeah years fuck yeah but I guess there's

810
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,220
new players younger players that have

811
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:42,929
come in there's like after the second

812
00:32:42,929 --> 00:32:44,970
game I just kind of was like it's the

813
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:46,860
same this story's done with yeah its own

814
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:49,320
I don't care about these because the

815
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,150
monster designs aren't particularly

816
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:53,070
interesting to me they're all too fat

817
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:55,230
too bulky in this space money won't be

818
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:58,760
so generic the story's so generic and

819
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:01,500
I'm not really sure how they've made sit

820
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,270
and the guy was up on stage and said I'm

821
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:05,520
so we never imagined all this success

822
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,420
and I was like I know what you mean

823
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,550
buddy

824
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:10,500
13 years ago when I began my Gears of

825
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,990
War journey we had no idea how big this

826
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:19,620
franchise would become Gears 5

827
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:24,549
it's a great ranch I come I'm sorry well

828
00:33:24,549 --> 00:33:26,440
I just shit all over here's probably

829
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,299
upset a lot of people but this is just

830
00:33:28,299 --> 00:33:29,950
my honest opinion I'm really not that

831
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:31,779
excited like you so when you bring yet

832
00:33:31,779 --> 00:33:33,720
another halo yet in other gears I'm like

833
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:38,590
you know we say yeah but no prove us

834
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:40,690
wrong we'll probably play it I skip for

835
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:42,610
I'm gonna be fucking law let's go three

836
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:44,770
more me I'm not sure if I'll play I do

837
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:46,510
be perfectly honest I don't know if I'll

838
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:48,580
play it because I know gears gameplay

839
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:50,500
and I know and I've already played gears

840
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,330
gameplay the only reason why I play it

841
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:54,190
is another game prestream to play with

842
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:58,480
us yeah anyways finally we end on one of

843
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,940
the more exciting reveals but again not

844
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:02,770
an xbox exclusive so you're just really

845
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:04,600
doing Sony's job for them you're doing a

846
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,370
computers job for them you're doing

847
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:08,770
everybody's job for them you know but I

848
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:10,330
guess you think since it's on your stage

849
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:12,429
everybody's gonna buy Xbox not true not

850
00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:14,530

city project ready play this right here

854
00:34:22,169 --> 00:34:27,490
fucking cyberpunk 2077 we got more not

855
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:29,800
exactly what I wanted what I wanted is

856
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,619
you guys to see this behind the scenes

857
00:34:32,619 --> 00:34:35,530
45 minute demo I said the same thing

858
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:37,599
about what your three when I went in

859
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:39,609
that interview as I please release this

860
00:34:39,609 --> 00:34:40,599
to the public

861
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:42,760
they never did you know what I mean this

862
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,470
is only for people and they even told

863
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:45,820
someone over there this is only for you

864
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,230
guys we're not showing this and I'm like

865
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:49,540
normal man I mean to sneak a camera up

866
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:53,260
in here because that trailer would sell

867
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:57,070
so many copies and it hurts me to then

868
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:59,230
watch them show other things and it's

869
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,670
not as good as a trailer and that's

870
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:01,990
what's happening with battlefield 5

871
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:05,710
right now right but that trailer was

872
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:07,630
amazing and I wish and and you know what

873
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:10,450
young yeah has a video on it it's an

874
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:12,369
hour long of him just talking about it

875
00:35:12,369 --> 00:35:15,220
but his memory is so good and detailed

876
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:17,380
go watch that hour and 20 minute video

877
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:19,390
where he describes everything that we

878
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:21,700
saw in that demo together I saw that

879
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,660
demo as well

880
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:24,400
and was it mind-blowing it was

881
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,670
mind-blowing it was so mind-blowing that

882
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:29,320
I didn't think it was real I was like

883
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,810
and they handed out all these surveys

884
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:32,330
after

885
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:34,160
like a you know how do we do is this

886
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,800
good you know I guess maybe I got this

887
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,450
feeling that they work and they like Joe

888
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:40,820
can we get a video of you talking about

889
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,230
what you thought about the game we'll

890
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:43,640
give it to the office cuz if y'all don't

891
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,380
know CD Projekt RED or big fans of the

892
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:48,800
age we first started talking to them

893
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,260
like at the tail end like which which

894
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:55,220
are too so so they got a lot of fans of

895
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,840
the images show there we're huge fans of

896
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:59,510
them and but it kind of gave me this

897
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:00,950
feeling like they're worried or

898
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,300
something or they don't know what

899
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:05,330
direction to take whatever direction is

900
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:08,210
in the fucking demo stick with that go

901
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:10,160
in that and I I'm actually probably

902
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,840
totally wrong because they probably have

903
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,820
a design direction and that just shows

904
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:15,320
how awesome these guys aren't that they

905
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,970
care that much they're like please give

906
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:18,020

909
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:25,340

910
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:27,920

911
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,360

913
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,420

Fant random fans in once they got all

919

the press for their appointment if there

920
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,200
was any open seats and people just

921
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,700

demo the guy right next to me was

926
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:58,820
playing I could grab the controller from

927
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,710
this yeah I know I quote him he actually

928

931
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:10,190

ya video because it's so detailed it's

933
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:15,460
there it's everything that I ever wanted

934
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:19,000
I'll just sum it up like this Deus Ex

935
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:25,750
Grand Theft Auto Witcher 3 Blade Runner

936
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:30,380
cyberpunk mashed all together you know

937
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:32,180
how I need a sexually Wow look at that

938
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:34,520
background that's so cool and in

939
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,500
cyberpunk wow look at that background

940
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:41,540
let's go there

941
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:43,500
how do you want to approach this you

942
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,730
want to go in or do you want to go still

943
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:45,990
you want to hack into it you want to do

944
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:47,700
this you want to do that it's like and

945
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,410
then there's dialogue options the first

946
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:51,510
person change was absolutely the right

947
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:53,339
decision because people get up in your

948
00:37:53,339 --> 00:37:57,770
face one yeah it's good it's good

949
00:37:57,770 --> 00:38:01,190
multiplayer no no multiplayer no

950
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:04,820
multiplayer co-op they are talking about

951
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:08,910
online integrations and I have a feeling

952
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:11,250
that they're looking into it now but

953
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:13,020
they're working on this game if you knew

954
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,880
the scope of this game and what you can

955
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,980
do not only is their exploration we're

956
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:18,780
talking witcher 3 open world exploration

957
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:22,430
but imagine a fucking city that it's

958
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:25,109
crammed with people and they have

959
00:38:25,109 --> 00:38:26,970
different walking animations people in

960
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:28,980
corporates are all walking on corporate

961
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,119
and then you got the gangsters on

962
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:31,740
walking gangsta you got all the drug

963
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:34,770
addicts on drew like I'm like oh god D

964
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:37,589
huh no wonder it's taken three four

965
00:38:37,589 --> 00:38:38,940
fuckin years and that's what I was

966
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:40,440
thinking the trailer was fucking fake

967
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:43,170
the demo was fake I had a half a mind to

968
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:45,990
push his controller but I wanted to see

969
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:52,830
yeah I watched it it was in Egypt so

970
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,270
what they were working hard on the whole

971
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:55,890
fuckin time and the fact that you can

972
00:38:55,890 --> 00:38:57,240
approach it in so many different ways

973
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,400
it's like Witcher 3 how many hours you

974
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,410
poured into that times three because you

975
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:03,180
could do it in all different ways and

976
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:05,250
there was this one corporate late I

977
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:06,390
don't know I should get in there was a

978
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:08,609
corporate lady and and she was gonna

979
00:39:08,609 --> 00:39:10,260
give you money to buy the bot from these

980
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:13,320
guys that stole this tech bot but you

981
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,150
could have just you know you walked up

982
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:16,890
on that little meeting you could've just

983
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:20,040
and just like killed her and all over

984
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,680
the security and then took her money and

985
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,750
then never even win over there to do

986
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:26,490
that it's amazing and I was like why

987
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:27,960
would you do this cuz there's amazing

988
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,359
story cuz once you get to those guys we

989
00:39:30,359 --> 00:39:32,190
were like let's do the talking way cuz

990
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:34,080
you could've came in you know again

991
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,820
right but no way we didn't talking and

992
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:37,320
they're like follow us and like fuck you

993
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,330
bitch you know as you're walking in you

994
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:41,010
know they're like don't you do anything

995
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:43,140
you know and then we start arguing over

996
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:45,000
the prize and there's different multiple

997
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,770
options on how to argue how do those

998
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:48,960
turn out but it turns out we did take

999
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,849
the girl and she betrayed us she put a

1000
00:39:50,849 --> 00:39:51,840
chip in the

1001
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,760
and a tracker and then the big expose to

1002
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:59,490
a guy it's good it's good amazing all

1003
00:39:59,490 --> 00:39:59,790
right

1004
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:02,760
oh hey thanks IRA plug so but can I take

1005
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,770
all that excitement and give credit to X

1006
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:07,470
marks no because it's that's that CD

1007
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:10,500
Projekt's Reds work so what I have to

1008
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,000
say about Xbox let's give it a final

1009
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,300
rating you're planning the seeds that's

1010
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,080
what I saw

1011
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,850
the studios this is the biggest thing

1012
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:22,440
they got five new studios that are Xbox

1013
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,660
only now that will create first party

1014
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:25,950
titles you know God of War in all this

1015
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:27,990
shit and last it was in the PlayStation

1016
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:30,420
Xbox is like we're gonna have that in

1017
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:32,700
and how long does it take to make real

1018
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:36,420
good games in a teacher 3 years what the

1019
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:37,860
fuck what the fuck you've been doing for

1020
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:40,050
the past 2 or 3 years why don't you can

1021
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:42,390
easily scale down that's what they all

1022
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:45,060
right so this is why I said no I'm Jeff

1023
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:48,020
Jeff Kelly's thing so the initiative

1024
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:50,820
former head of Crystal Dynamics so the

1025
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:52,470
Tomb Raider games we like they're good

1026
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:54,960
so that one might result in a brand new

1027
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,060
IP that's really good but if you really

1028
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:58,740
looked at these five studios you're

1029
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:01,170
starting to say wait a minute you're

1030
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:02,700
trying to trick us a little bit

1031
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,830
bamboozling bamboo because what's one of

1032
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:06,930
the other studios undead labs what do

1033
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:08,790
they make state of decay wait a minute

1034
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:10,980
stated the king was already exclusive to

1035
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:13,650
the Xbox stayed at the k2 is kind of a

1036
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:16,880
remake of the first was not it's sorry

1037
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,320
so it's one of those sea of thieves kind

1038
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,520
of things are knowing are we I mean

1039
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,020
disappointing you already have that

1040
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:24,060
studio that's weird and then what's the

1041
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:26,370
other one playground games guess what

1042
00:41:26,370 --> 00:41:29,010
they make the Forza horizon wait a

1043
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:33,210
minute all you're doing is you're just

1044
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:35,250
putting a little line on a contract

1045
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:39,360
that's all it is so so there's the oh

1046
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,640
here's here is one though ninja theory

1047
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:44,940
that is one they had hell-blade which

1048
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:47,010
was critically acclaimed but they also

1049
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:49,770
did DM C DM C that will make cried know

1050
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:51,120
who make cry you don't I mean right I

1051
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:53,790
think I think they did that but but so

1052
00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:55,950
that one might result in a brand new IP

1053
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:57,660
that's good and then there's compulsion

1054
00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:00,270
games which is we happy few which I'm

1055
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:01,800
tired of and I'm like what the fuck well

1056
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,810
it's not gonna apply to me yeah for like

1057
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:04,829
four years

1058
00:42:04,829 --> 00:42:06,660
oh shit it's been an early access for

1059
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,880
like - yeah and so yeah what the fuck

1060
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,920
and and that's gonna be multi-platform

1061
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,539
so I guess the next project then we're

1062
00:42:12,539 --> 00:42:14,369
gone so if you really break it down it's

1063
00:42:14,369 --> 00:42:17,009
not five studios it's really only three

1064
00:42:17,009 --> 00:42:20,279
and really only two that I that I care

1065
00:42:20,279 --> 00:42:21,959
about you know what I'm saying but

1066
00:42:21,959 --> 00:42:23,880
you'll have to prove me wrong Microsoft

1067
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:27,170
oh yeah where we rating it will go with

1068
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:31,559
Dell first okay give Sony five

1069
00:42:31,559 --> 00:42:33,569
I gave Sony of five do you think

1070
00:42:33,569 --> 00:42:35,099
Microsoft did better I think they did

1071
00:42:35,099 --> 00:42:36,539
better come on are the technical

1072
00:42:36,539 --> 00:42:40,650
disaster and Microsoft was it about

1073
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:42,959
Microsoft's thing I have to rate it

1074
00:42:42,959 --> 00:42:44,789
based on what Microsoft is bringing to

1075
00:42:44,789 --> 00:42:47,400
the table as Microsoft and so to me it's

1076
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,900
like otherwise you're just rating

1077
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,640
trainers rating trailers and it's like

1078
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,349
okay yeah they showed off fallout but

1079
00:42:52,349 --> 00:42:53,670
I'm not giving him credit for it that's

1080
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:55,499
a Bethesda yeah they showed up cyberpunk

1081
00:42:55,499 --> 00:42:57,930
that's not Microsoft I'm not giving them

1082
00:42:57,930 --> 00:42:59,640
pretty for Kingdom Hearts 3 is I'm both

1083
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,709
but everything's like the fact that they

1084
00:43:01,709 --> 00:43:03,839
got an onyx mucks good the thing is I

1085
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:05,729
agree with you was overloaded and from a

1086
00:43:05,729 --> 00:43:07,259
technical standpoint they nailed it I

1087
00:43:07,259 --> 00:43:08,819
thought it was well done it was clean it

1088
00:43:08,819 --> 00:43:11,069
wasn't awful it was good and their games

1089
00:43:11,069 --> 00:43:13,559
were ok but to me like things like Halo

1090
00:43:13,559 --> 00:43:16,499
and Gears I don't care mm-hmm and it's

1091
00:43:16,499 --> 00:43:17,910
not that I don't think they're ok games

1092
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:20,039
they've always been ok or good games

1093
00:43:20,039 --> 00:43:21,449
it's just there's too many of them in

1094
00:43:21,449 --> 00:43:23,160
their net there's no system cellar

1095
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,140
there's no system cellar anymore and

1096
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:26,309
because of that you know I got to give

1097
00:43:26,309 --> 00:43:30,599
the Xbox conference like a 10 to tip 7

1098
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:33,029
as far as like what I because it was

1099
00:43:33,029 --> 00:43:35,099
enjoyable it wasn't bad in any way it

1100
00:43:35,099 --> 00:43:38,309
was just not it didn't captivate me into

1101
00:43:38,309 --> 00:43:40,319
boys it was good points higher than Sony

1102
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:41,789
it wasn't it was good but it wasn't

1103
00:43:41,789 --> 00:43:45,809
amazing huh ok all right Joe I'm gonna i

1104
00:43:45,809 --> 00:43:48,390
like sony better even though it did have

1105
00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:50,930
those long things yeah good job sony

1106
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:53,160
actually brought something to the dan

1107
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:55,199
yeah and i'm with you lots first party

1108
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:57,690
something microsoft from the guy this is

1109
00:43:57,690 --> 00:43:58,199
your year

1110
00:43:58,199 --> 00:44:01,319
this is gonna make me upgrade my xbox to

1111
00:44:01,319 --> 00:44:03,269
make me get another console or something

1112
00:44:03,269 --> 00:44:05,910
and like yeah the titles around look

1113
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:08,009
cool but not enough to persuade me to

1114
00:44:08,009 --> 00:44:10,289
pick it up yeah i would say probably a

1115
00:44:10,289 --> 00:44:12,779
six the only thing i could take away is

1116
00:44:12,779 --> 00:44:14,039
that everything that i want to play is

1117
00:44:14,039 --> 00:44:15,380
on pc

1118
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:17,180
and like I said as much as that fucking

1119
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:19,760
hurts Xbox props to Microsoft for

1120
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,200
knowing that there's like thirty to

1121
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,400
forty percent of their player base

1122
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:23,990
doesn't give a shit about consoles I

1123
00:44:23,990 --> 00:44:26,690
just want to play on PC like we've got

1124
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:28,490
what like thousand dollar systems you

1125
00:44:28,490 --> 00:44:29,960
know we don't want to buy another system

1126
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:31,880
and they're catering to that I'm gonna

1127
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:33,620
change my opinion here as I have it

1128
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:35,630
written down different I am gonna after

1129
00:44:35,630 --> 00:44:38,180
talking about it seeing what specific

1130
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:41,150
games were I'm actually rating Microsoft

1131
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:42,740
it's tough

1132
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:51,160
Microsoft won unprecedented disaster

1133
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:53,480
presentation I've run it down some

1134
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:56,600
points interesting games so but what

1135
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:59,900
matters the most when you're doing Sony

1136
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:03,470
Microsoft they want you to buy their

1137
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:06,740
products and and Microsoft well they

1138
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:08,840
showed off all the products come into

1139
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,910
every platform ever and they had world

1140
00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:13,430
premieres and it was a great show and

1141
00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:16,040
the game pass it's not something like

1142
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:18,020
joe said that it gets me live fire up

1143
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:19,910
and turn on my xbox to stop playing my

1144
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:22,370
ps4 and start recording footage on the

1145
00:45:22,370 --> 00:45:24,170
Xbox from now and it just didn't you

1146
00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:27,770
know it's so so they lose in terms of

1147
00:45:27,770 --> 00:45:30,320
games because gears and halo can only go

1148
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:32,090
on for so long can only make you excited

1149
00:45:32,090 --> 00:45:34,310
for so long and they really had nothing

1150
00:45:34,310 --> 00:45:37,070
else besides gears and and Halo that

1151
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:39,850
isn't on other things

1152
00:45:39,850 --> 00:45:43,580
42 and for Forza horizon for and guess

1153
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:45,740
what I'm gonna get that Xbox game past

1154
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:47,300
and I'm gonna play those games for a

1155
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:49,070
little bit and I'm gonna cancel my Xbox

1156
00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:50,960
game fast cuz that's how I think most

1157
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:54,020
people should run that right don't

1158
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:56,660
forget to cancel you know I'll call you

1159
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:58,250
angry Joe calling you I used to do that

1160
00:45:58,250 --> 00:46:00,110
he's this so cable a long time ago for

1161
00:46:00,110 --> 00:46:02,270
Time Warner and I was like digital cable

1162
00:46:02,270 --> 00:46:03,740
is like you know what you sign up for

1163
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:06,080
digital cable right now and then you

1164
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:07,880
cancel within 30 days they don't charge

1165
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:10,190
you so I'll remind you and I'll give you

1166
00:46:10,190 --> 00:46:14,960
a cost I remind all of y'all hey cancel

1167
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:17,870
it begins from I got wonder if that

1168
00:46:17,870 --> 00:46:20,360
hurts the developers though Mike if you

1169
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,490
don't give the full truth does it hurt a

1170
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:25,200
little upper that's the rule

1171
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,630
why what I'm hoping is in Microsoft gave

1172
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:29,370
them some money to put them on their

1173
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:31,200
service I'm hoping because I don't want

1174
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,090
that to hack a developers tell me if

1175
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:34,440
that's the case then I want you to know

1176
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:36,300
because as I will love supporting

1177
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:38,640
developers yeah anyways so Microsoft

1178
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,920
final verdict I changed my rating

1179
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:42,720
initially I thought Microsoft was above

1180
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,570
Sony and that's only true for the show

1181
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:48,780
but for games I still I think Sony is

1182
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:51,360
above but I really have slapped Sony in

1183
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,950
the fucking face because I'm really

1184
00:46:52,950 --> 00:46:55,650
feeling like don't do that again I'm

1185
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:57,600
really feeling like they're losing it so

1186
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:00,240
I also have to give Microsoft props cuz

1187
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:01,440
they're better than all their other

1188
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:01,890
years

1189
00:47:01,890 --> 00:47:03,770
yeah might would they did a great job

1190
00:47:03,770 --> 00:47:06,660
but in terms of games I'm not sure they

1191
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:09,240
didn't just talk about TVs so yeah so

1192
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:14,180
we'll see so we got 6 out of 10 for Sony

1193
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:17,160
I'm gonna go 6 out of 10 for Microsoft

1194
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:20,340
that that reflects the sort of way you

1195
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:22,650
know flip of better presentation because

1196
00:47:22,650 --> 00:47:24,320
I have to factor in the presentation and

1197
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:27,060
planting the seed and and them seeming

1198
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:28,680
to understand that we need to talk about

1199
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:30,360
games we need something all this shit

1200
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:32,070
about and there's no more connect you

1201
00:47:32,070 --> 00:47:34,530
know there's no there's no VR there's no

1202
00:47:34,530 --> 00:47:36,840
nothing there's games and guess what

1203
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:38,460
guys we understand you want more first

1204
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:40,080
party titles so we're buying this we're

1205
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:41,880
buying that we're buying that hey also

1206
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:45,750
you want greater deals Xbox game Pass so

1207
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:48,990
I must say a tie with Sony and it was

1208
00:47:48,990 --> 00:47:51,210
this year Sony year to fucking blow them

1209
00:47:51,210 --> 00:47:53,640
out of the water and and Microsoft to

1210
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:54,300
fuck it up

1211
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:56,850
Microsoft didn't fuck it up and Sony

1212
00:47:56,850 --> 00:47:59,490
fucked it up and and ruin their

1213
00:47:59,490 --> 00:48:01,740
presentation and really kind of did a

1214
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:04,380
disservice to some of their games and so

1215
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:06,510
that's why ultimately about the same

1216
00:48:06,510 --> 00:48:07,560
well you know what the most biggest

1217
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:08,990
disappointment was about the Xbox

1218
00:48:08,990 --> 00:48:12,690
conference but no Star Wars dance-off to

1219
00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:15,630
where we get this equal that we deserve

1220
00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:19,350
honestly that's what Star Wars connect

1221
00:48:19,350 --> 00:48:21,930
to they're done with that Han Solo to I

1222
00:48:21,930 --> 00:48:27,480
want to read come on solo okay all right
