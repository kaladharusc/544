51
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,360
made a movie about this set if you

one of the movies that like I'm most

00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,100
proud of it took me a whole summer to

55
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,010
make the movie but the apex of the movie

56
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:39,010
was me proposing to Candace right on

57
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:47,710
this bridge she and I had come to

58
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:50,350
Amsterdam when we first met like years

59
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,720
and years and years earlier it was an

60
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,210
amazing time so that year I remember at

61
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:56,740
Euro 2012 or something

62
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:59,919
I got her tickets to Amsterdam for

63
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,350
Valentine's Day like that was the idea

64
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,669
we're coming here for Valentine's Day

65
00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:06,940
and we got here I was so nervous I

66
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,800
wasn't nervous that she was gonna say no

67
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,660
I was nervous that she was gonna find

68
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:13,270
out we got here and I know it's this

69
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,350
bridge because we checked into that

70
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:15,550
hotel right over there

71
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,470
now hotel she was like what do you want

72
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:18,700
to do it I was if it's just go for a

73
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,460
walk we walked on this bridge I'm being

74
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,080
kind of a minister like people around so

75
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,250
I don't like wait for the people

76
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:28,300
disappear and then yeah then I just

77
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,530
popped the question

78
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:35,220
I remember she didn't say yes right away

79
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,530
that can it's what the fuck but she told

80
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:39,140
me later that she just was like so

81
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,860
overwhelmed that she didn't know what to

82
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:41,280
do

83
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,600
alright that's my whole Amsterdam

84
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,060
proposal story it's now 7:30 to it I

85
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:49,320
feel like nothing's open I know what

86
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,210
else to do but I'll keep skateboarding

87
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:52,570
around

so I had a very bad people fall I was

94
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:58,210
getting to the train station

95
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:01,510
and my skateboard wheel fell into where

96
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:11,479
the tram like the streetcar tracks are

97
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:14,639
and the skateboard just stopped cold and

98
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,550
I went full weight forward but like I

99
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:20,340
see no 25 pound backpack was my laptop

100
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,490
in any problem and my camera in my hand

101
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:26,069
and I I broke this camera that's why I'm

102
00:07:26,069 --> 00:07:29,069
recording this on my phone but I fell on

103
00:07:29,069 --> 00:07:32,969
my hands in a really bad way and when

104
00:07:32,969 --> 00:07:35,400
looked out at my pinky this is an

105
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,499
accurate depiction of what my hand

106
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:41,039
looked like that was my pinky literally

107
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,960
been half like that like you see in

108
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,789
those viral YouTube video for vibration

109
00:07:44,789 --> 00:07:47,009
finger in time that's what it look like

110
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:49,800
like my immediate instinct rush get nice

111
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:57,890
in here is hospital

112
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:00,420
but then I like took a deep breath and I

113
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,490
grabbed onto in my hand I just like

114
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:06,060
snapped it like snap into place with

115
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:09,330
force and it kind of went back together

116
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:13,680
and it's pretty swollen right now but it

117
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,450
works and it's not like it was so I

118
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:21,270
definitely did some damage but I forced

119
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,760
it back into place and although while to

120
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,500
the doctor when I get to Finland I don't

121
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,640
think it's going to kill me in the next

122
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:35,860
couple of hours it was scary

00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,970
advantage of a three-hour layover I was

127
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,170
way better than sitting in the lounge

eating tiny fish on now I'm gonna get

129

some ice and I'm gonna get some work
