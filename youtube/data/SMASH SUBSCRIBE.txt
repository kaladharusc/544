*Battle music playing

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:09,400
My fellow bros, my fellow brethren, my fellow comrades

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:13,620
the time has come for us to fight back

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:14,560
no more

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:18,020
will we become oppressed by mainstream

6
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,320
media!

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,960
No more

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,880
will I take this online abuse

9
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:24,700
and hatred!

10
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:25,760
No more

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,420
will I say &quot;I'm sorry, I messed up Okaay?

12
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,220
And you know why?

13
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,520
I'm number one. I'm number one

14
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,860
No more lame boxing matches

15
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:41,600
I challenge T-series into a saber fight like real men

16
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,140
I'm throwing my glove at you T-Series

17
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:44,880
Fight me

18
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,420
IRL to the death. No boxing glove and helmets

19
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,190
I'm talking about to the death here

20
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,480
If they won't accept my sword challenge

21
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,600
then the only thing we can do is fight fire

22
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,200
with fire

23
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,280
