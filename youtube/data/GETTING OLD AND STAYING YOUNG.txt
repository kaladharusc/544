00:00:50,100 --> 00:01:02,710
deal for let me explain morning

00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:05,089
old tradition of mind always have a

9
00:01:05,089 --> 00:01:07,640
bagel before a race today's a big deal

10
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,200
because how you sir in a lot of races

11
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,470
but I haven't run one in three years and

12
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:15,500
today is me confronting that by running

13
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,630
my first race in three years and my

14
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:19,910
little brother's coming there for moral

15
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:27,650
support and I paid for the bagels well

[Music]

21
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,930
we've arrived

22
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:56,220
I'm gonna go register for the race now I

23
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:59,830
[Music]

24
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:02,180
thought I could sign up today you're not

25
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:05,420
allowed to sign up race day to register

26
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,910
they told me no they told me to go home

27
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:10,940
I found the race director and he says

28
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,220
you let me run I don't get a time though

29
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,350
or like a bib where you put the number

30
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:17,270
on but whatever I get to run it's

31
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:17,840
official

32
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:26,090
a little concerned about the temperature

33
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:27,860
though it's freezing everyone has on

34
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:30,470
sweatpants and tights and this is what I

35
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,280
brought to run in

36
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:39,870
[Music]

37
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:49,800
ready starts in ten minutes okay race

38
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,200
starts in like four minutes you know

39
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,970
what it is I mean I run every day and

40
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:56,340
I've run 50 races before that

41
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,739
butterflies right now I think what it is

42
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:02,129
like I'm getting old I'm 35 now and I

43
00:03:02,129 --> 00:03:04,110
can tell myself that I'm in great shape

44
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:06,480
and I feel young and all that but when

45
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,799
you actually show up to something like

46
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:10,200
this and there's a clock and a time it's

47
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,019
like an actual test of how well I'm

48
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:16,110
maintained its confronting that that I

49
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:19,910
think makes me a little nervous

50
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,720
wish me luck

51
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,260

57
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:30,110
[Music]

58
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:34,290
super super happy with my performance in

59
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,630
my first race out in three years you

60
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,640
know the timing tip right I'm too here

61
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:45,720
on my on my phone I came at 103 which

62
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,780
puts me here can you see this so I ran a

63
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,660
little further at 10.2 miles a six

64
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,570
minute 14 second pace I think it puts me

65
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:57,000
around 20th place out of maybe like a

66
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,910
thousand runners felt good though as you

67
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:03,090
get older the price of maintaining your

68
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:06,240
youth goes up and up and up and what

69
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,940
that means is when you're like 15 16 18

70
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,530
years old you know wherever the hell you

71
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:12,090
want you don't have to exercise you're

72
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:12,690
skinny

73
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:15,030
it's easy in your 20s it gets a little

74
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:18,000
harder you get fat in college you become

75
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,620
even older and all it gets harder and

76
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,590
harder the older you are the harder you

77
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:32,160
have to work there was this guy in front

78
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,860
of me during the race and gray hair gray

79
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,720
mustache he was ahead of me the whole

80
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,580
race we started together but he was

81
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,960
ahead of me the whole race and I was

82
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,880
chasing him down as best I could and I

83
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,130
finally caught up to him at Mile 9 one

84
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:46,350
mile left and I pulled up next to him

85
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:50,729
and he turns mean he goes 60 I'm 60

86
00:05:50,729 --> 00:06:03,720
years old at 60 he's as fast as I am at

87
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,090
35 busting my ass he's as fast as I am

88
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:09,419
if there's one truth that I know is that

89
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:11,250
the source of the Fountain of Youth can

90
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:16,520
be summed up with one word work

91
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,050
[Applause]

92
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:25,320
[Music]

93
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,670
by the way the main reason why I brought

94
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:29,830
my kid brother today I mean I like

95
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,970
hanging out with the kid but the main

96
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:32,200
reason why I brought him was so he could

97
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,780
film me while I ran he missed the shot

98
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,520
of me crossing the finish line because

99
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,830
he was in the car getting warm thanks
