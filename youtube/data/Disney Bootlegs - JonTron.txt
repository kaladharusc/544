1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:40,420
jontron

2
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:42,500
so do you think you could run that whole

3
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,270
thing by me one more time about where

4
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:46,329
the light goes or whatever it is

5
00:00:46,329 --> 00:00:49,309
everything the light touches is our

6
00:00:49,309 --> 00:00:51,320
kingdom say it again say it to my

7
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:57,229
fucking face while bootlegging fossa you

9
00:00:59,449 --> 00:01:07,369

12
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:18,649
Tallyho I've come bearing news from the

13
00:01:18,649 --> 00:01:23,539
higher ups please advise thanks you will

14
00:01:23,539 --> 00:01:26,690
never know my suffering forever trapped

15
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:29,479
inside this robotic host all right

what do we have here Wow look at that a

18
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,300
cease and desist from Disney yeah that's

19
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,610
probably about right all right you two

20
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:46,520
get the hell out of my house it's over

21
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,229
well unfortunately Disney's lawyers

22
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:50,940
could get to me a little too easily but

23
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,290
I'll tell you what is much farther away

24
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:54,660
from US jurisdiction and far better at

25
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:58,590
Disney bootlegging China such examples

26
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,540
of their bootleggers II include bear of

27
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,790
the interest the self purported baby's

28
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,190
toy and also high-class weapon who farts

29
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:07,259
is a very well-known catchphrase please

30
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:09,420
play under the adult inspect to protect

31
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,920
I don't pretend everyone knows that one

32
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,390
there's not a chance I'm interested miss

33
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:18,480
bear yes even a company like Disney who

34
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,250
is well known to be so very protective

35
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,900
of its brands wasn't exempt from the

36
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,180
video game bootlegging phenomenon much

37
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,489
to their dismay these games as usual

38
00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:28,380
take all forms and are generally cobbled

39
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,910
together producing hilarious results

40
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,280
much at a time so let's have ourselves

41
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:39,930
on first off let's have a look at some

42
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:41,730
bootlegs based on the Lion King films

43
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,860
starting with quite simply a game called

44
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,910
The Lion King hmm copyright the Walt

45
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:48,690
Disney Company

46
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,310
well at least they were nice enough to

47
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:55,560
attribute it to the right people that

48
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,549
music I don't think that's the Lion King

49
00:02:58,549 --> 00:03:01,620
Mowgli begins his journey through the

50
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,600
lion to find the man village

51
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,209
Mowgli hunt the truth true to hall nine

52
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:08,220
huh so Mowgli's head is down here why is

53
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,440
this just the jungle book this is just

54
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,420
the jungle book game for NES with minor

55
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,519
things changed like instead of Mowgli

56
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:16,590
it's a bipedal lion that doesn't look

57
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,000
like anything from The Lion King

58
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,010
you're still ripping off disney with the

59
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,660
jungle book why didn't you just rip off

60
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,250
a Lion King game this is some

61
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:32,590
ass-backwards logic

62
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:41,770
well if you can't beat him join

63
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:44,330
okay next up we have another one The

64
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:46,430
Lion King five don't know where three

65
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,180
and four went

66
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,410
I'm sure they'll give some sort of

67
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:49,970
synopsis for those of us who missed out

68
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:52,310
Timon is really having a good time here

69
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,840
okay you could tell by that mad flailing

70
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,340
in this game you can select from three

71
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,920
characters Timon Simba and Pumbaa Simba

72
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,050
and Pumbaa look correct but Timon has no

73
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:02,840
ears and is wearing a bowtie like what

74
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,400
you got the reference right on the other

75
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:04,880
two

76
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,100
what's wrong with Timon oh dear God it's

77
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,660
walking fingers I mean have you guys

78
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,490
seen the movie you couldn't have just

79
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:11,990
put something here that wasn't walking

80
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:14,090
fingers a lizard you know a wild

81
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:15,830
wildebeest not walking fingers is the

82
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,450
main point I'm trying to make this game

83
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:19,010
is basically a reproduction of the one

84
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:21,049
for Super Nintendo but it controls much

85
00:04:21,049 --> 00:04:23,480
worse and it's super glitchy sometimes

86
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,130
you can get farther by manipulating the

87
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:27,040
edge screen and scroll it's pretty wacky

88
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:48,330
it's so dope out of lives

89
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:51,730
are you kidding me simba fucking hangs

90
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:54,070
himself when you get a game over he just

91
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,450
steps into a noose

92
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:56,860
he didn't even kick over a chair the

93
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,320
earth beneath them just gives way yes as

94
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,850
you see it this game is apparently

95
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:02,710
infamous for its ridiculous game over

96
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,750
sequences which also include Timon

97
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,090
crying while digging his own grave and

98
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:09,100
Pumbaa jumping into a pot of scalding

99
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,020
water somebody made this folks this is

100
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,820
real I can't understand the rest of the

101
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,530
game is pretty standard it's not meant

102
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:16,180
to be shocking or anything maybe they

103
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,820
just thought that made sense okay say

104
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,100
circle life so I'm going dead huh

105
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,100
because he knows circular I can't live

106
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:27,160
in a small anymore such a bummer himself

107
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,990
while crying at the Boomer cooking self

108
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:31,390
Oh for me

109
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,940
I never mind up keep going I got The

110
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,130
Lion King 2 on Genesis here ok how can I

111
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:38,020
say no to that face they're getting very

112
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,640
close to just calling up a lion king and

113
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,320
having it be about the Lion King very

114
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,390
close we're almost there now most

115
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,160
bootleg games of this nature are made

116
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,080
with recycled sprites and assets but

117
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,310
this one here is unique and that it was

118
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,720
made from the ground up as its own game

119
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,290
you never know we're gonna get with this

120
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:57,610
from the daily arrived on

121
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:03,930
I was scared BuzzFeed

122
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,860
seriously maybe they could have taken

123
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,599
some of the face they gave to Mufasa and

124
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:09,039
funneled it it's a little Simba over

125
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,300
here looks like he got his head door

126
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:15,280
slam by uma Thurman in Kill Bill hmm The

127
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,590
Lion King is looking markedly more how

128
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:23,740
you say Chinese this time around what

129
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,389
was that pussy shit get the fuck outta

130
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:27,599
here

131
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:29,530
all right whatever that's a little

132
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:30,849
better I guess I'm not gonna scold you

133
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:32,889
twice in a row whatever The Lion King -

134
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:34,800
we're in China now deal with it

135
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,080
zone one will in what the hell is

136
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,219
grilling well I guess this is grilling

137
00:06:42,219 --> 00:06:44,050
that old Mufasa over here seems to get

138
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:46,060
the joke huh once again given that this

139
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,740
game was made from the ground up I don't

140
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,569
understand why every single enemy has

141
00:06:49,569 --> 00:06:51,819
nothing to do with the Lion King this

142
00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:53,409
one kind of works on Mario rules if you

143
00:06:53,409 --> 00:06:56,439
grab the big ball of gas you turn into

144
00:06:56,439 --> 00:06:58,000
older Simba and if you get hit you turn

145
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,969
into smaller Simba that crap I died

146
00:07:01,969 --> 00:07:04,309
wait what why why again with the

147
00:07:04,309 --> 00:07:06,169
brutality he's just hanging here again

148
00:07:06,169 --> 00:07:07,639
from a rope this time not around his

149
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:09,529
neck granted he's clinging a dear life

150
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:11,959
while ominous music plays do the Chinese

151
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:14,209
just resent Simba or something you can

152
00:07:14,209 --> 00:07:16,099
tell this game is supposed to play like

153
00:07:16,099 --> 00:07:18,110
the SNES version of Lion King which the

154
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:19,849
sprite of Simba is directly ripped from

155
00:07:19,849 --> 00:07:21,979
but it can't quite pull it off jumps are

156
00:07:21,979 --> 00:07:23,329
hard everything is floaty and its

157
00:07:23,329 --> 00:07:27,229
overall just pretty tedious ah yes

158
00:07:27,229 --> 00:07:30,229
Jin's tomb forget the terracotta

159
00:07:30,229 --> 00:07:32,779
soldiers really tied it all together and

160
00:07:32,779 --> 00:07:34,219
Skaar was there

161
00:07:34,219 --> 00:07:35,779
yeah round here they start getting too

162
00:07:35,779 --> 00:07:37,459
cute with their level design it's like

163
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:39,169
making a linear platformer wasn't enough

164
00:07:39,169 --> 00:07:40,429
for them they had to show off their

165
00:07:40,429 --> 00:07:42,589
programming skills too like in this

166
00:07:42,589 --> 00:07:44,059
level you come to a dead end or that

167
00:07:44,059 --> 00:07:45,739
makes a weird noise when you show up to

168
00:07:45,739 --> 00:07:53,349
it come on what is a glitch what a joy

169
00:07:53,349 --> 00:07:56,059
so after like 30 literal minutes of me

170
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:57,439
running around wanting to blow my brains

171
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:59,119
out I finally figured out what you're

172
00:07:59,119 --> 00:08:00,709
supposed to do you're supposed to kill

173
00:08:00,709 --> 00:08:02,479
all the enemies in the section you're in

174
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,579
and only then will the door open up for

175
00:08:04,579 --> 00:08:18,679
you not to mention you end up going back

176
00:08:18,679 --> 00:08:20,329
and forth between the same doors on

177
00:08:20,329 --> 00:08:22,399
accident because it all looks the same

178
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:24,949
also why is this game set in Imperial

179
00:08:24,949 --> 00:08:26,599
China the longer I play the angrier I

180
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:28,309
get about it how the Lions walk from

181
00:08:28,309 --> 00:08:30,379
Africa to there it's pretty far I

182
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:31,849
honestly don't know why I'm still

183
00:08:31,849 --> 00:08:33,620
torturing myself by playing this I've

184
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,419
been here for over six hours and I've

185
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:39,279
got nothing to show for it

186
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,060
all my life leading up to this moment

187
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:47,259
has been worth it last second I am truly

188
00:08:47,259 --> 00:08:50,740
blessed beep beep beep I'm sorry what's

189
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,160
that

190
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,660
oh that's just that you can't make this

191
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:56,339
shit up alarm get out of my brain

192
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:58,449
no guys honestly Khan if you're

193
00:08:58,449 --> 00:09:00,040
wondering where this imagery of Simba

194
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,779
cruising atop a swastika Laden blimp

195
00:09:01,779 --> 00:09:04,149
comes from was very simple ok Hitler was

196
00:09:04,149 --> 00:09:18,410
a big fan of the Disney Renaissance

197
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:21,509
well anyways after that life-changer

198
00:09:21,509 --> 00:09:23,310
you just walk off screen to the right

199
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:25,230
and the game ends what a way to go and

200
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,879
don't you see the final boss was

201
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:29,189
confronting the Nazi inside of all of us

202
00:09:29,189 --> 00:09:30,720
hell I think at least I don't know it's

203
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,139
all I got

204
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:33,180
okay moving on from The Lion King we

205
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:43,410
have Mulan for Genesis hey calm down

206
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:44,790
moo shu would you maybe tread a little

207
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,319
more lightly some people are trying to

208
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:48,079
sleep around here

209
00:09:48,079 --> 00:09:53,339
wanna be a man well I mean I don't know

210
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:55,529
I've considered it I don't know if I'm

211
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:57,329
ready to make the decision though but

212
00:09:57,329 --> 00:09:59,310
thanks for the offer if you haven't seen

213
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:00,420
the movie this is a horribly

214
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,639
mistranslated reference to the song be a

215
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:04,410
man from Mulan but at least they're

216
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:06,329
trying to give us the option huh alright

217
00:10:06,329 --> 00:10:08,819
the game starts and of course they don't

218
00:10:08,819 --> 00:10:10,889
use the song that this level is based on

219
00:10:10,889 --> 00:10:15,770
why would they

220
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:18,150
Milan what the fuck you know those

221
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:20,070
people they're your friends yeah in the

222
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,600
movies she's friends with these

223
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,100
characters but I guess in the world of

224
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,190
pirated games it's just a free-for-all

225
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:28,560
boy what is this a Freddy Krueger glory

226
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,500
hole the absolute most I can say for

227
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,150
this game is that at least it attempts

228
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:34,740
to be somewhat familiar with the subject

229
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,060
matter the characters look pretty

230
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,560
convincingly like they could be from an

231
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:41,420
actual Disney licensed game so alright

232
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:52,010
greatest wall it's completely subjective

233
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:55,260
Snow planet yeah as you know move on has

234
00:10:55,260 --> 00:11:02,970
always been the best sci-fi all right

00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:04,710
nice job guys except for on those hearts

236
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:06,780
they're terribly terribly asymmetrical

237
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:10,410
and you should be ashamed hey there John

238
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:13,650

believe is real this is one of those

250
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,110
moments how could anyone have let this

251
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:03,010
happen

252
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:06,100
seven clever boys I are these the boys

253

255

picture they look like they were the

256
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,160
result of a brother and sister we like

257
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,560
each other maybe just a little too much

258
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,290

259
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:19,780

middle feeling very stranded and very

266
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,760
helpless to amend the situation they're

267
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:42,910

403
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:24,860
here

404
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,810
all right it's pretty cool labyrinth

405
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:28,490
shirt I'll actually wear that Harry

406
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:30,280

407
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:34,820
Harry Potter doesn't suck don't keep

408
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:38,600
them Mel Gibson oh my Ted's Nathan Drake

409
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,180
Mel Gibson I think this is my personal

410
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,490
favorite one by far it's like um it's

411
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:45,050
the old time you drink the beer thing

412
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:48,470
you know or just like a sacrificial you

413
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:53,960
know out out for real quest adventure

414
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,790
awaits you enter the forest at the

415
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:58,160
darkest point where there is no path see

416
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,950
honestly just a bad idea I think this is

417
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:03,800
a 20-sided die holder but the Tony

418
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,090
decided died on the inside not the

419
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:06,290
outside that's a shame because any

420
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:08,210
control this is the 20-sided die who

421
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:08,780
needs it

422
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,280
and also if you're so inclined there is

423
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,020
the loot anime box what do we got in

424
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:15,170

425
