1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,040
hey so just a little info about this

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,929
collection now we still get hit with a

3
00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:06,060
lot of copyright claim sadly and we do

4
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,440
fight them but we have to fight them

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,150
slowly or else we might get a strike and

6
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,910
such and one of the groups that comes

7
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,219
after us a lot is sadly Studio Ghibli in

8
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:15,900
Japan the Japan version I don't think

9
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,090
the American one comes after us so we

10
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,609
haven't posted is nice embers of the

11
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:24,539
Studio Ghibli collection but we're

12
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:27,150
posting it here because we figure if

13
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,039
it's one video that gets hit that's a

14
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,900
giant collection of them that we can

15
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,840
fight easier than a ton of them but what

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,120
we did that month is that we had Studio

17
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,530
Ghibli and then we have like kind of

18
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,450
these other Disney films I didn't review

19
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,129
that people want me to review so we're

20
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:42,809
gonna split them up into two and this is

21
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:45,180
the collection of just the Studio Ghibli

22
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,960
films and we'll have the other ones that

23
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,120
were in this month in another collection

24
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,460
I'd just be safe if this one does get

25
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,379
hit you can still watch the other ones

26
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:57,840
while we fight that so with that said

27
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,770
take a look and enjoy if you were to ask

28
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,600
a random person on the street who hyoe

29
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,060
Miyazaki was chances are they wouldn't

30
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,310
know but if you were to ask a movie buff

31
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,890
anyone online or pretty much any person

32
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:12,630
from Japan everyone would tell you that

33
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:14,760
he is the animation champion of the

34
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,400
world only in the past 10-15 years has

35
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,960
he finally started to get credit in

36
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,619
America

37
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:21,750
allowing our audiences to see tons and

38
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,970
tons of his genius work but it turns out

39
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:25,229
he's not the only one turning out

40
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:27,479
Miyazaki material his animation company

41
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:29,369
Studio Ghibli has also been turning out

42
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:31,650
timeless classic after timeless classic

43
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,720
again only starting to get recognition

44
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,210
in America in the past 10-15 years and

45
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:37,950
who do we have to thank for all this

46
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,930
imagination being shown to us that's

47
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:42,750
right the Big D or more specifically

48
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,549
John Lasseter who's friends with Hayao

49
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:46,439
Miyazaki and promised to get as much of

50
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,420
his work to our audiences as possible

51
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,460
the result was the majority of the

52
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,380
studio's films being re-released and

53
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,189
redubbed

54
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:55,200
in America but they didn't just half-ass

55
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,850
it they went out of their way to get the

56
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,860
best talent possible but that sound

57
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,540
people the best translators and of

58
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,640
course the best actors it only figures

59
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,439
that Disney another great leader and

60
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:06,270
animation imagination would be the

61
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,979
people to introduce us to not only such

62
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:08,950
wonderful artwork

63
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:11,230
such fantastic stories so this Disney

64
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:13,690
Center every single day of the month I

65
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:15,519
am gonna be looking at one of the film's

66
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:18,310
from Miyazaki or Miyazaki Studio the one

67
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,629
catches that it has to have been

68
00:02:19,629 --> 00:02:22,060
re-released by Disney and read up by

69
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:24,370
them because hey it is Disney Center

70
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,590
now there's only one problem with that

71
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,599
there's not enough films to fill out the

72
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:31,090
entire month so what am I gonna do

73
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:33,010
I'm gonna go back to all the films that

74
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:34,599
people requested but I never got around

75
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:35,170
to

76
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:36,459
that's right The Nightmare Before

77
00:02:36,459 --> 00:02:39,190
Christmas is the Dick Tracy's hell I'll

78
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,540
even go over the ones I did a view log

79
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,700
of already but people seem to want to

80
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,709
see the Disney Center version of it and

81
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:46,840
a some time has gone by maybe some of

82
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,940
the opinions have changed so every other

83
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,739
day it's a Studio Ghibli film and the

84
00:02:50,739 --> 00:02:52,090
other half of the days it's gonna be one

85
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:54,040
of the Disney classics but he'll even

86
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,319
that's not enough so I'm gonna give in

87
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,299
to peer pressure and also do a V log

88
00:02:58,299 --> 00:03:00,130
series on one that'd be giving a lot of

89
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:02,290
requests to do for awhile that's right

90
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:03,940
both my brother and I are gonna be doing

91
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,640
a veal OGG series of gravity falls right

92
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,470
along with Disney cember every single

93
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,269
day of the month it'll be the most

94
00:03:10,269 --> 00:03:12,370
ambitious Disney cember yet you'll be

95
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:14,170
vomiting rainbows a week after watching

96
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:16,269
them there's a lot of imagination a lot

97
00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:17,650
of great characters a lot of great

98
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,269
stories hell there's just a lot of

99
00:03:19,269 --> 00:03:21,100
greatness to get there so sit back

100
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,829
everybody this is Disney cember the

101
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:26,049
Studio Ghibli overlook classics and

102
00:03:26,049 --> 00:03:29,969
gravity falls edition

103
00:03:29,969 --> 00:03:32,469
let's start with a film that wasn't

104
00:03:32,469 --> 00:03:34,269
technically studio ghibli when they came

105
00:03:34,269 --> 00:03:36,189
out but they still marketed under the

106
00:03:36,189 --> 00:03:38,319
name and Disney pick it up anyway so I

107
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,310
think it counts

108
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,439
nossek on the valley of the wind a film

109
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:43,749
surely not to be ignored this was only

110
00:03:43,749 --> 00:03:46,000
director Miyazaki second film and

111
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,269
already it was a gigantic epic the story

112
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:51,459
centers around the princess yeah get

113
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:52,959
used to seeing those I think Ghibli

114
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,760
might be the only studio that actually

115
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,859
uses princesses more than Disney who

116
00:03:56,859 --> 00:03:59,469
lives in an apocalyptic future actually

117
00:03:59,469 --> 00:04:02,139
one of the nicer apocalyptic futures

118
00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:04,629
very green lots of mountains nice

119
00:04:04,629 --> 00:04:07,510
scenery well at least in this part of

120
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:09,040
the world other parts of the world

121
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,840
there's nothing but war a-brewin

122
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,939
everyone's attacking everyone trying to

123
00:04:12,939 --> 00:04:14,889
find old monsters and creatures to

124
00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:16,750
destroy one another when those warring

125
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,220
countries find the valley of the wind

126
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,139
they see an opportunity to use their

127
00:04:20,139 --> 00:04:21,699
land and their resources to their

128
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:23,949
advantage Nausicaa after discovering the

129
00:04:23,949 --> 00:04:25,810
death of her father peacefully tries to

130
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:27,639
find a way to save everybody and not

131
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:29,680
cause any more bloodshed along the way

132
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,120
comes across a boy who's on the other

133
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,909
side and asks her to join his quest but

134
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:35,440
she doesn't want to be on any one side

135
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,690
she just wants war to leave and no more

136
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:41,050
people to die no more people or bugs yes

137
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,550
in this futuristic world there's also

138
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,889
giant monsters that look like bugs l

139
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:46,479
even the plains Catholic white buttons

140
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:47,919
but you can't cool will you think about

141
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,750
it you assume all birds are gone in this

142
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,370
world so their planes wouldn't really

143
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:53,259
look like birds like ours instead they

144
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:54,159
would look like insects

145
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:56,470
Gavin II know but nevertheless Nausicaa

146
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,150
doesn't want anything living to perish

147
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:00,430
so she goes back and forth between every

148
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,320
single side imaginable trying to find

149
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,780
the peaceful route for only a second

150
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,759
film it's one hell of an ambitious

151
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:09,400
project it tries to throw so much of you

152
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,500
and for the most part it pays off pretty

153
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,479
well you very easily understand the

154
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,340
conflict of every single character and

155
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,780
every single character does have a

156
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,909
conflict it's a lot of fun just seeing

157
00:05:18,909 --> 00:05:20,229
them work off each other trying to

158
00:05:20,229 --> 00:05:22,300
figure out strategies what to do next

159
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,590
everything is always in a huge rush

160
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,840
something like that can usually be a

161
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,389
little too busy and distracting but the

162
00:05:28,389 --> 00:05:29,710
characters are strong enough to pull it

163
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:31,389
through at first I thought was kind of

164
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:33,039
weird that Nausicaa would flip-flop back

165
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,810
and forth between sort of this crying

166
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:37,539
sad emotional person to the sudden sword

167
00:05:37,539 --> 00:05:39,279
wheeling badass that always seems to

168
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:40,990
have a plan but when you see what it's

169
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:42,520
all building up to in the end

170
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,160
yeah does kind of make sense it's kind

171
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,930
of like a peaceful person who knows how

172
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,789
to fight but never really wants to fight

173
00:05:48,789 --> 00:05:50,259
because he doesn't want to see anyone

174
00:05:50,259 --> 00:05:52,030
her so when she does have to do it for

175
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:53,680
her rage gets the best of her she feels

176
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,750
an incredible amount of guilt but that

177
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,030
said I love the fact that she always has

178
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:01,090
a plan I mean always our ship is going

179
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:02,650
down you go this way I'll go that way

180
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:03,849
I'll jump up here and do this thing

181
00:06:03,849 --> 00:06:05,500
Kingdom being overthrown I'll go this

182
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,310
way you go this way

183
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:08,229
well rendezvous after we do the huge big

184
00:06:08,229 --> 00:06:10,090
gigantic thing she isn't just kicking a

185
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:11,919
little bit of ass and that's it she

186
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,050
always has a strategy and she comes up

187
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:15,130
with him so fast

188
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:17,380
she's a lot of fun to watch she also has

189
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,210
a real good supporting cast voice actors

190
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:20,710
like Patrick Stewart and Shia LaBeouf

191
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:22,990
really add a lot of credibility yeah I

192
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:24,310
know what you're thinking Shia LeBoeuf

193
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,479
at credibility

194
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:27,069
well yeah say what you will about

195
00:06:27,069 --> 00:06:28,960
personal life in the transformer movies

196
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,759
but I don't think he's that bad an actor

197
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:32,770
and I think he finds just the right mix

198
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:35,020
in this role angry and vengeful but

199
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,490
still looking for the right thing to do

200
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:38,949
if I did have a problem with this film

201
00:06:38,949 --> 00:06:41,620
though I would actually say that as good

202
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,539
as the characters are I could have used

203
00:06:43,539 --> 00:06:46,539
just a little bit more that is to say if

204
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:48,610
a story like this really want to have

205
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:50,710
the biggest impact it probably should

206
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,259
have been tunes I mean when I say they

207
00:06:53,259 --> 00:06:55,419
throw a lot at you and it is constantly

208
00:06:55,419 --> 00:06:57,310
on the move that's not to say they don't

209
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,259
have they're slower moments to just be

210
00:06:59,259 --> 00:07:01,210
characters they do and they're done well

211
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:03,729
but for the giant climax this film is

212
00:07:03,729 --> 00:07:05,860
trying to build up at the end I felt I

213
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,630
really want to know these people a touch

214
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:08,319
more

215
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,090
for example the villain play by uma

216
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:11,889
Thurman and their second-in-command seem

217
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:13,690
to have this kind of playful banter

218
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:15,819
where they almost hope the other would

219
00:07:15,819 --> 00:07:18,190
die but they also kind of respect the

220
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:20,259
strategy of the other a part of me

221
00:07:20,259 --> 00:07:22,569
really want to know more about that but

222
00:07:22,569 --> 00:07:24,430
it's a big animated epic and you can

223
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:26,979
only fit into two hours so a lot of that

224
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:28,779
stuff has to be cut and I'm sure there

225
00:07:28,779 --> 00:07:30,759
was more stuff this is based on a manga

226
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:32,469
I get the feeling they went into even

227
00:07:32,469 --> 00:07:34,719
more detail about these people it's not

228
00:07:34,719 --> 00:07:36,099
that the film needs to be longer it

229
00:07:36,099 --> 00:07:38,050
already feels like a decent length I

230
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:40,029
just felt like I really want to be on

231
00:07:40,029 --> 00:07:42,039
these characters side more than what I

232
00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:44,259
was which is to say I didn't want to see

233
00:07:44,259 --> 00:07:45,330
them perish

234
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:46,860
I didn't feel the entire weight of the

235
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,629
film the way I think it wanted me to

236
00:07:48,629 --> 00:07:51,479
feel it maybe one or two less scenes of

237
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:53,460
traveling and shouting orders replaced

238
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,080
with a little bit more of natural

239
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,030
talking we've done it but that really is

240
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:59,400
a bit of a nitpick it's still very large

241
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,349
and scale I'm very impressive to look at

242
00:08:01,349 --> 00:08:02,879
and I want to know what it's all gonna

243
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,039
to have they been able to explore a

244
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,020
little bit more I think this could have

245
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,639
been on par with say the Lord of Rings

246
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,919
movies but as is it's still pretty damn

247
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:11,520
impressive

248
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,439
it's so cool seeing where all of these

249
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:15,870
Miyazaki tropes started the technology

250
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,479
the monsters the love of nature his

251
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,610
thumbprint is all over it and it's even

252
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:21,690
more impressive when do you think no

253
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:23,639
computers were used on it either I mean

254
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:25,229
look at this this looks like something

255
00:08:25,229 --> 00:08:27,240
that could be animated to date great

256
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,039
backgrounds great environment great

257
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,319
atmosphere great characters great story

258
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:33,300
what else can you say Nasik on the

259
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,669
valley of the wind is just great go take

260
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:37,030
a rent and see for yourself

261
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:48,470
[Music]

262
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:50,509
[Music]

263
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:53,339
the awesomeness of castle in the sky can

264
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:55,079
be summed up right in the very opening

265
00:08:55,079 --> 00:08:57,480
ships are sewing through the air a young

266
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,850
girl falls out a boy discovers her and

267
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:02,279
suddenly a glowing crystal causes her to

268
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:04,680
slowly but surely float down to the

269
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,600
ground while it chanting music is played

270
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,209
yep that's the movie in a nutshell and I

271
00:09:09,209 --> 00:09:11,579
mean that in a very positive way castle

272
00:09:11,579 --> 00:09:12,899
in the sky has all the ambitious

273
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:15,060
adventure of a kids film that you

274
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,069
remember watching in the 80s the ones

275
00:09:17,069 --> 00:09:19,230
that had a touch of an edge but mostly a

276
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:22,230
very timeless endearing feel to them the

277
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:24,720
ones like Return to Oz or labyrinth the

278
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,639
ones that still seem to hold up after so

279
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:29,399
many years for the most part there's no

280
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:31,529
data but copies in this though may be

281
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:34,079
the head of that robot could anyway the

282
00:09:34,079 --> 00:09:35,790
film starts off exactly like I said a

283
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,440
girl falling to the ground and a boy

284
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,690
discovers her the boy's name is pazzo

285
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:41,579
and the girl's name is cheetah voiced by

286
00:09:41,579 --> 00:09:43,740
Anna Paquin and james van der beek he

287
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,480
misses her back to health as she admit

288
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,829
that she's being chased by some

289
00:09:46,829 --> 00:09:49,380
evildoers the kind that know that she is

290
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,630
the key to some sort of mystical

291
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,819
something or other again variaties

292
00:09:53,819 --> 00:09:56,130
fantasy quite coincidentally pazzo has

293
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:57,449
been looking for that something or other

294
00:09:57,449 --> 00:10:00,269
a floating city known as Laputa some

295
00:10:00,269 --> 00:10:01,889
believe it's been destroyed others say

296
00:10:01,889 --> 00:10:03,899
it never existed but of course our young

297
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:06,149
heroes are destined to discover it along

298
00:10:06,149 --> 00:10:07,199
the way they come across some

299
00:10:07,199 --> 00:10:08,970
treacherous air pirates with their

300
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:10,740
leader voiced by Cloris Leachman who in

301
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,660
my opinion can do no wrong she once

302
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,430
again plays up both the comedy and the

303
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:16,560
awesomeness of this character being both

304
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,689
goofy and badass at the same time the

305
00:10:18,689 --> 00:10:20,339
villains chasing them are led by mark

306
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:22,560
hamil who if you know his voiceover work

307
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,380
once again gives a deviously delicious

308
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,990
performance dragging out his lines and

309
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:29,970
constantly making you question does he

310
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:32,189
have a British accent or not once again

311
00:10:32,189 --> 00:10:33,870
not only does the artwork in this movie

312
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,490
show a lot of patience and a lot of

313
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:37,350
passion but the creativity is just

314
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:39,420
wonderful I feel like I'm watching an

315
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,490
extended version of the timeless Disney

316
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:43,740
Afternoon shows kind of like ducktales

317
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:47,730
meets tailspin duck tales been with

318
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,410
people but whatever you call it it's a

319
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:51,209
ton of fun the dubbing is once again

320
00:10:51,209 --> 00:10:53,399
very well done with the main characters

321
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:54,840
voices displaying the why

322
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,670
wimzie and the side characters being

323
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,770
goofy and memorable for whatever reason

324
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:00,480
I especially like the lighting in this

325
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,730
film too particularly the day versus

326
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:04,560
night I'm always a sucker for night

327
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,840
shots to have that warm glow from a

328
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,760
building and something about Miyazaki

329
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,340
skies are always just so blue you can

330
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,380
get lost in them somehow I don't know

331
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,120
what color is choosing or what palette

332
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,710
he has but they're always just

333
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,900
incredible you want to fly through these

334
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,720
guys every time you see you if I had to

335
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,150
nitpick anything wrong I guess I could

336
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,430
say that maybe James Van Der Beek sounds

337
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:28,800
a touch too old to be playing this part

338
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,750
but then again you can't quite figure

339
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,880
out the boys age maybe just as voice is

340
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,740
changing everything else in this movie

341
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,590
is classic Miyazaki a lot of focus on

342
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:39,870
the tentacles and how they work a lot of

343
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:42,060
using machinery but also this very high

344
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,160
respect for plant life there's something

345
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,050
so cool about seeing those rustic robots

346
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:48,270
and yet having green grow on them in

347
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:50,010
strange way I think that almost sums up

348
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:52,470
Miyazaki's work a perfect combination of

349
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:54,780
advanced technology that's also kind of

350
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,970
old kind of new but always has a good

351
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:59,130
mix of nature in there too the Pirates

352
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:01,200
especially are just so likable I don't

353
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,400
know what it is about them there's just

354
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,650
so much energy and they're so goofy and

355
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:06,300
they have such an awesome leader it's

356
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,830
pretty hard not to wish you could be a

357
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,930
part of this group it has a lot of the

358
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,820
pretty imagery I love the nice colors

359
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,440
and a lot of the imagination that you

360
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,660
usually associated with his work it's

361
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,280
hard to know what else to say about it I

362
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,660
mean I don't know if it's gonna be

363
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:21,360
breaking any big barriers necessarily at

364
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,340
least none that I know of but as these

365
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,800
general fantasies go once that mix

366
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,410
technology with great characters and a

367
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:30,990
gripping story with lots of nature and

368
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:33,900
excitement and romance and just all that

369
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,820
good stuff you've grown to love this one

370
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,590
mixes them up pretty good take flight

371
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:51,460
and discover for yourself

372
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,529
[Music]

373
00:12:53,529 --> 00:12:55,970
whenever there's a discussion about the

374
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:58,519
most powerful animated films like no

375
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:01,970
fairytales no magic just pure raw adult

376
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:04,399
emotion grave of the fireflies is

377
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,589
usually brought up a lot of people

378
00:13:06,589 --> 00:13:08,389
consider it a good segue who see

379
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:10,550
animation as just kids stuff something

380
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:12,319
that can't be taken seriously by adults

381
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:14,660
so when I heard that I got really

382
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,790
excited and I sort of got this idea of

383
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,350
what it was gonna be like and what it

384
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:20,389
was gonna be about I saw this film

385
00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:21,920
around the same time I saw Saving

386
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,019
Private Ryan on the big screen and I had

387
00:13:24,019 --> 00:13:25,490
an idea what it was gonna be

388
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:27,829
Oh war is bad people throwing up their

389
00:13:27,829 --> 00:13:30,470
hands saying why oh the no good of

390
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:32,300
violence and so on and so forth

391
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,870
but what I got was something very very

392
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:37,100
different I knew it was gonna be more

393
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,649
focused on the family end but not quite

394
00:13:39,649 --> 00:13:42,319
in the way they depicted it I don't even

395
00:13:42,319 --> 00:13:45,290
see it as really a war movie I see it

396
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:47,120
more as a battle between pride and

397
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,250
sanity between love and

398
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:52,040
self-preservation so it kind of confused

399
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,600
me when I was younger cuz I kept

400
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,100
thinking I was going to see some serve

401
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,139
anti-war film and I thought that's not

402
00:13:57,139 --> 00:13:59,480
really what I got I didn't dislike it I

403
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,310
knew it was good I just didn't quite

404
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:03,410
know what to clarify it as what to

405
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:05,870
accept it as now that I'm older that's

406
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,519
one of the things I liked the most about

407
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,459
it it doesn't seem anti-war or pro war

408
00:14:10,459 --> 00:14:12,740
it's just a boy and his sister trying to

409
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:15,139
figure out what's the most important you

410
00:14:15,139 --> 00:14:16,610
know the films gonna be grim when you

411
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:18,290
see the death of our main character

412
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,970
being reunited with the spirit of his

413
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:22,339
younger sister well we know this doesn't

414
00:14:22,339 --> 00:14:24,560
end happily we can only go up from here

415
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,480
the two have a flash bag as they roam

416
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,160
the spirit world of how they got to

417
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,050
where they are the boy's name is SATA

418
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:32,300
and the girl is Cisco they're in the

419
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,009
final days of world war ii but you

420
00:14:34,009 --> 00:14:35,360
wouldn't know it with all the bombings

421
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,399
are still going on their fathers in the

422
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:39,079
war and their mother is suddenly killed

423
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:41,029
from one of the bombings the two decided

424
00:14:41,029 --> 00:14:42,649
to go live with the distant aunt but she

425
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:44,480
starts to get a little on their nerves

426
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,309
claiming they aren't working hard enough

427
00:14:46,309 --> 00:14:47,930
for the food that she's preparing and

428
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:50,120
having a pretty understandable breakdown

429
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,829
every once in a while for the situation

430
00:14:51,829 --> 00:14:53,750
that she's been put in unsatisfied with

431
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:56,059
the living situation sienta decides to

432
00:14:56,059 --> 00:14:57,470
take his sister and live on their own

433
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:59,839
believing he's totally capable of doing

434
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,910
so trying to claim his independence

435
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:04,220
slowly but surely he discovers that they

436
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:04,819
can't serve

437
00:15:04,819 --> 00:15:07,009
on their own but he's too proud and too

438
00:15:07,009 --> 00:15:08,779
determined to see the truth and lives in

439
00:15:08,779 --> 00:15:10,939
a horrible state of denial thinking they

440
00:15:10,939 --> 00:15:12,439
if he tries harder and sticks to his

441
00:15:12,439 --> 00:15:14,089
independence they can come out of this

442
00:15:14,089 --> 00:15:16,669
okay but reality starts to set in and

443
00:15:16,669 --> 00:15:18,319
options start become fewer and fewer

444
00:15:18,319 --> 00:15:20,569
always thinking salvation is just a day

445
00:15:20,569 --> 00:15:22,850
away he continues to try as best living

446
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:25,249
on his own laws world crumbles the

447
00:15:25,249 --> 00:15:27,259
artistic style in this movies not trying

448
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,809
to be so much prettier showing off as

449
00:15:29,809 --> 00:15:32,179
much as trying to be more realistic they

450
00:15:32,179 --> 00:15:34,069
still move like animate characters but

451
00:15:34,069 --> 00:15:36,529
it's not trying to do any big kicks or

452
00:15:36,529 --> 00:15:38,899
flips or any weird angles most of the

453
00:15:38,899 --> 00:15:40,939
shots keep very still and just let the

454
00:15:40,939 --> 00:15:42,649
emotion of the animation carry it

455
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:44,660
through as well as the voice acting

456
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,220
which is dubbed over pretty well I

457
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,899
personally grew up with a subtitle

458
00:15:47,899 --> 00:15:49,399
version and prefer that one a bit more

459
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:51,079
but the dub is still very well done

460
00:15:51,079 --> 00:15:52,970
there's a lot of different ways you can

461
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:54,919
look at this movie on the one hand you

462
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:56,569
can see the boy as a terrible character

463
00:15:56,569 --> 00:15:58,549
not only is he laying himself start to

464
00:15:58,549 --> 00:16:00,049
death be slaying his sister's start to

465
00:16:00,049 --> 00:16:02,119
death as well but I think because they

466
00:16:02,119 --> 00:16:04,459
choose to do this age it makes us

467
00:16:04,459 --> 00:16:06,350
suddenly understand what he's trying to

468
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:08,059
accomplish I think a lot of growing

469
00:16:08,059 --> 00:16:10,100
people at that age can become incredibly

470
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,049
delusional and that may be part of the

471
00:16:12,049 --> 00:16:13,819
focus of the story is not to try and

472
00:16:13,819 --> 00:16:14,989
grow up too fast

473
00:16:14,989 --> 00:16:16,850
and to appreciate what you have and who

474
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:19,159
you have while you still have them well

475
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:21,229
many people see it as an anti-war film I

476
00:16:21,229 --> 00:16:23,600
suppose you can see it as that way my

477
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,399
thought is that this can take place over

478
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:27,559
any disaster it could happen after a

479
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:30,619
tornado a tsunami and earthquake or yes

480
00:16:30,619 --> 00:16:33,439
even a war the focus is on the boy who

481
00:16:33,439 --> 00:16:35,359
doesn't realize how far he's being

482
00:16:35,359 --> 00:16:37,309
pushed and that there's no crime and

483
00:16:37,309 --> 00:16:39,289
accepting failure or asking for help

484
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:41,029
part of what makes it work is that the

485
00:16:41,029 --> 00:16:43,699
boy himself is not a mean character a

486
00:16:43,699 --> 00:16:45,229
lot of people that have a lot of pride

487
00:16:45,229 --> 00:16:47,149
they usually just throw into the jerk

488
00:16:47,149 --> 00:16:48,889
category oh there's nothing good about

489
00:16:48,889 --> 00:16:50,449
them they're just too full of themselves

490
00:16:50,449 --> 00:16:52,100
and think they can do stuff that's

491
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,049
totally delusional but this kids a

492
00:16:54,049 --> 00:16:56,449
likable kid his dad is a fighter and he

493
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:58,100
wants to do the same thing he wants to

494
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,079
be the big supporter a lot of young

495
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,399
people were under that delusion during

496
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:03,619
World War two if you're failing it just

497
00:17:03,619 --> 00:17:04,759
means you're not trying hard enough

498
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:06,949
fight harder fight harder I think

499
00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:08,839
there's this sense of losing one's on or

500
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:10,970
if you accept defeat which is fitting as

501
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:13,010
we CCA to witness the surrender of Japan

502
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:15,589
and he's furious by it he doesn't care

503
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:16,519
that the war is over

504
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:17,779
he's just torn apart

505
00:17:17,779 --> 00:17:19,639
they actually lost it's a film that

506
00:17:19,639 --> 00:17:21,889
takes an angle that many films like this

507
00:17:21,889 --> 00:17:24,109
don't take not the family element

508
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:26,029
there's a lot of movies that do that but

509
00:17:26,029 --> 00:17:27,919
the coming-of-age element of knowing

510
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,749
when to declare your independence and

511
00:17:29,749 --> 00:17:31,759
when not to and that the consequences

512
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,320
can be greater than you ever could have

513
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,070
imagined

514
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,599
for someone who was expecting more the

515
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:37,070
Saving Private Ryan route where there's

516
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:39,349
gonna be a lot of dead bodies and a lot

517
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:42,019
of gore and a lot of obvious symbolism I

518
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,820
was really blown away that the

519
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,440
emotionally gripping and tormenting

520
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,029
parts of this movie are the simple

521
00:17:47,029 --> 00:17:48,979
choices that they make and how easily

522
00:17:48,979 --> 00:17:50,779
things could have been fixed if he just

523
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:52,700
swallowed his pride as a young man

524
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,229
watching this I don't know if I was

525
00:17:54,229 --> 00:17:56,149
really ready to accept that or at least

526
00:17:56,149 --> 00:17:58,399
I didn't know how to accept it

527
00:17:58,399 --> 00:18:00,049
maybe in that way it was more ahead of

528
00:18:00,049 --> 00:18:01,909
its time an adult than I thought you

529
00:18:01,909 --> 00:18:03,469
have to have a real understanding of

530
00:18:03,469 --> 00:18:05,570
what misguided pride can do and what the

531
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:07,759
non acceptance of failure can be capable

532
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:10,190
of the honorable route is not always the

533
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,899
winning route and that's a tough thing

534
00:18:11,899 --> 00:18:13,460
not just for people growing up to learn

535
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,139
but for straight-up grown-ups to learn

536
00:18:15,139 --> 00:18:16,909
it gets a little better and a little

537
00:18:16,909 --> 00:18:18,559
more heartbreaking every single time I

538
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,269
see it and maybe that's because I feel

539
00:18:20,269 --> 00:18:21,499
like I understand it have been more

540
00:18:21,499 --> 00:18:23,719
every time I see it but again one of the

541
00:18:23,719 --> 00:18:25,429
great things is you could look at at a

542
00:18:25,429 --> 00:18:27,109
totally different way maybe it's about

543
00:18:27,109 --> 00:18:29,059
respecting your elders maybe there is no

544
00:18:29,059 --> 00:18:30,979
right or wrong maybe it's all about the

545
00:18:30,979 --> 00:18:32,089
war maybe it's all about the

546
00:18:32,089 --> 00:18:34,489
consequences of war anyone can look at

547
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:36,529
and draw their own conclusion what is

548
00:18:36,529 --> 00:18:38,359
concrete about the film is that you look

549
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:40,219
at these two characters and want them to

550
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:41,989
make it through even though you're told

551
00:18:41,989 --> 00:18:43,429
at the very beginning that they're not

552
00:18:43,429 --> 00:18:45,169
going to make it through this makes it

553
00:18:45,169 --> 00:18:46,549
all the more heartbreaking as you watch

554
00:18:46,549 --> 00:18:48,739
whatever age you are it's an important

555
00:18:48,739 --> 00:18:50,869
film to check out it's unlike any other

556
00:18:50,869 --> 00:18:52,879
film of its kind and deserves all the

557
00:18:52,879 --> 00:18:54,210
praise that it gets

558
00:18:54,210 --> 00:19:12,340
[Music]

559
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:14,860
[Music]

560
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:18,050
it's the iconic my neighbor totoro

561
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:20,420
a character so famous they's actually

562
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:23,000
the icon for studio ghibli a big hit in

563
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,770
Japan and even growing a cult following

564
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:26,990
in America the hype and good talk around

565
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:29,600
this movie is so big that a lot of

566
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,520
people Edgeley end up kind of not liking

567
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,970
it and I can see why it's built up so

568
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:37,520
much and this image is so popular that

569
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,560
anyone going in thinking they're gonna

570
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,840
see the spectacular big story is

571
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,360
probably gonna be really disappointed

572
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,530
luckily when I went in I had no

573
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:47,600
expectations whatsoever I've just got it

574
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,550
from a friend saying hey this is a good

575
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:51,770
movie check it out I did and that's

576
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:53,390
pretty much what I thought - it was a

577
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:56,150
good movie not great I don't think it's

578
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:57,500
supposed to be great I think it's

579
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,300
supposed to be just a fun little flick

580
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,670
why there's such an explosion over it I

581
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:04,280
don't know maybe people just like the

582
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,470
sort of smaller flicks and want to get

583
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:08,090
it more attention to a point where it's

584
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:09,770
actually exploded into this giant

585
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:11,090
franchise it's kind of like how a

586
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:13,610
Christmas story has but for what it is I

587
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:15,680
like it fine the stories about a family

588
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,750
that moves into a new home there's a

589
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,580
father a mother and two little daughters

590
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,980
played by the Fanning sisters what they

591
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,150
discover something very interesting

592
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:24,800
about this home apparently there's

593
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,290
spirits all over the place in any other

594
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:29,720
movie this would probably be a scary

595
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,060
thing but the family just kind of

596
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:34,970
accepts it and says hi sometimes the

597
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:36,470
spirits say hi back but most the time

598
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:38,750
they just keep in hiding and wouldn't

599
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:42,350
you know it one of them is a giant koala

600
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:47,000
cat turu thing known as Totoro he

601
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,670
doesn't exactly do much he just kind of

602
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:51,950
sleeps takes the bus

603
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:54,830
he can fly that's kind of cool and he

604
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:56,720
has absolutely no dialogue outside of

605
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,410
one or two roars and that's about it

606
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:02,900
really that's the movie it's just sort

607
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,730
of watching these girls interact with

608
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,980
the spirit and them getting used to

609
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:10,580
moving to a new location and or whatever

610
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:13,280
reason it kind of works and don't get me

611
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:13,460
wrong

612
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,200
there's still some incredible imagery in

613
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,210
this the backgrounds are wonderful

614
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:19,400
there's this cat bus thing that's now

615
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:19,910
become

616
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:22,070
world-famous and a lot of flying scenes

617
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:24,380
are very nice if you were to ask me what

618
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:27,140
happens scene by scene like an order of

619
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:29,780
the story I couldn't tell you that is to

620
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,970
say stuff does happen you see them

621
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:33,800
trying to get used to being this plays

622
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,080
and interacting with boys and so on so

623
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,090
forth but the story's not really the

624
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:40,460
focus the focus is more character an

625
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:42,560
atmosphere the casting of the Fanning

626
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,540
sisters was a very clever call as they

627
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,220
weren't very naturally off each other

628
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:48,290
they don't act like Co actors or even

629
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:50,180
just friends they feel like sisters

630
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:52,190
something about that camaraderie and the

631
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:53,750
way to work off each other it's pretty

632
00:21:53,750 --> 00:22:03,590
solid the rest of the voice acting is

633
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:05,930
pretty good too so not a ton is required

634
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:08,330
of it it's still pretty effective it's

635
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:10,030
kind of like spending a really laid-back

636
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:13,070
Sunday outside with some friends maybe

637
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:15,560
coming across a weird animal trying to

638
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,870
interact with it playing around getting

639
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:19,970
dirty coming home and going to sleep

640
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:23,330
that's kind of the movie but again

641
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:26,720
that's kind of childhood - isn't it kind

642
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,730
of those fun summer days where you could

643
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:30,500
just sort of do whatever you want you're

644
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,510
out of school and I don't know that's

645
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:34,340
how I see this movie it's just kind of a

646
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:36,650
really fun yet laid-back summer when

647
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:37,670
you're a little kid

648
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:39,620
there's fun music and goofiness but

649
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,570
there's also a lot of quiet moments of

650
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:43,460
just a character looking at another

651
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:45,380
character or just taking the other end

652
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:47,300
now there's something actually really

653
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,250
charming about it no no maybe that's

654
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:50,780
kind of a strange fascination with the

655
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,880
film that absolutely nothing can happen

656
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,250
on screen and yet you're still kind of

657
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:57,320
sucked into it there's a whole scene

658
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,970
where one of the sisters just sits on

659
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:01,250
top of Totoro and that's it there's a

660
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:02,600
nursery where the other sister just

661
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,460
waits for a bus with Totoro and that's

662
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,530
it yet something about the way it's

663
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:09,110
paced and animated and delivered it

664
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:12,320
feels very alive somehow you don't feel

665
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,120
like you're being manipulated or that

666
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,070
this is lazy you look like you're

667
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,810
watching something kind of cool

668
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:20,600
not spectacular but kind of cool and the

669
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,400
film allows you to take in this small

670
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,280
bit of wonder well it's not big it still

671
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,200
allows you to take in the full amount

672
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,590
you soak in the scene you remember the

673
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:32,020
feelings you remember the ex

674
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,910
freshens if stuff like that doesn't do

675
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:34,990
it for you and you're looking for

676
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:36,400
something that's a lot more story based

677
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,230
then you're probably not gonna have a

678
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:40,120
good time with this granted there is a

679
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,220
dilemma in the last third of the film

680
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,980
but it almost feels a little forced and

681
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:47,140
in some ways not needed like the film

682
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:50,080
just needed some kind of climax that's

683
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,000
nowhere near so contrived that ruins

684
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,560
anything you still want to see

685
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,360
everything turn out okay and stick with

686
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,700
these characters oh yeah don't expect a

687
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:00,250
lot of action or a lot of wonder or a

688
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:02,950
lot of story but just expect a small

689
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:05,380
amount to be satisfied I think that's

690
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,790
part of the charm of Miyazaki's films

691
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:08,890
you had this art form of animation

692
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:11,470
anything you can draw can suddenly exist

693
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:13,810
and yet they use it to tell the story of

694
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:16,870
only a few fantastical things and focus

695
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:19,300
more on the human characters something

696
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,950
about keeping it so minimal actually

697
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:22,660
makes you appreciate what's on screen

698
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:25,210
even more at least from my point of view

699
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:27,040
I don't know I even heard there's like

700
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,720
any kind of backlash for this film but

701
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,010
I've definitely heard of people that

702
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,810
watched it and just didn't get what it

703
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:34,180
was all about and I can understand that

704
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:36,070
there is so much build-up for this movie

705
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:37,690
the image is shown all over the place

706
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:39,700
hell it's even in Toy Story if you're

707
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,710
looking for more of a relaxed film that

708
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:43,510
you can pop in and just sort of enjoy

709
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:45,610
the atmosphere of you'll find it to be

710
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:48,340
pretty charming pretty creative and just

711
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,870
the right amount of entertaining I

712
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:51,670
personally don't see it as one of my

713
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:53,290
favorites I don't even know if I put in

714
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:55,240
one of Miyazaki's top five but it's

715
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,890
still good and there's a lot of effort

716
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:58,990
that's put into it it's small it's

717
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:00,730
simple who says there's anything wrong

718
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:03,160
with that

719
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:15,550
[Music]

720
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:17,669
[Music]

721
00:25:17,669 --> 00:25:19,600
everybody's gonna have a film that just

722
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,370
connects with them for some reason they

723
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:23,830
can't entirely explain for many that

724
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:26,169
movie was my neighbor totoro for me it's

725
00:25:26,169 --> 00:25:28,600
Kiki's Delivery Service in a sense

726
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,210
they're very similar not a lot of story

727
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:33,519
not a lot of action just sort of a

728
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:35,289
laid-back set up with a touch of the

729
00:25:35,289 --> 00:25:37,419
supernatural but for some reason this

730
00:25:37,419 --> 00:25:39,759
really grabbed me and hooked me a lot

731
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:41,590
more than my neighbor totoro did and

732
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:43,179
that's especially impressive when you're

733
00:25:43,179 --> 00:25:45,220
given the age that I saw it I was a

734
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,809
junior in high school when I first saw

735
00:25:46,809 --> 00:25:48,730
this and I didn't want to see any of

736
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:51,279
this prissy stuff what a little bitch

737
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:54,549
with a big bow flying around not casting

738
00:25:54,549 --> 00:25:57,250
spells but instead delivering bread to

739
00:25:57,250 --> 00:26:00,490
people come on give her a machine gun or

740
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:01,750
something I'm a stupid high schooler

741
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:03,730
that's what I want to see but even with

742
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:05,889
that prejudice going in I saw this on TV

743
00:26:05,889 --> 00:26:09,519
and surprisingly kept watching it even

744
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:12,000
for his cutesy and simple as it was

745
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,740
something about it just really drew me

746
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:17,259
into it to a point where at the end I

747
00:26:17,259 --> 00:26:20,049
found myself really loving it the story

748
00:26:20,049 --> 00:26:22,480
centers around Kiki of course played by

749
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,549
Kirsten Dunst she's excited because

750
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:26,500
she's at the age where witches can set

751
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,269
off on their own and try to find their

752
00:26:28,269 --> 00:26:30,820
own identity they leave the family find

753
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,830
a place to live and try to see if they

754
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:34,990
can work in the real world she flies to

755
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:36,309
a town far away where she eventually

756
00:26:36,309 --> 00:26:38,230
gets a job as a delivery girl

757
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:40,629
accompanied by her snarky cat voiced by

758
00:26:40,629 --> 00:26:42,429
Phil Hartman the movie just follows her

759
00:26:42,429 --> 00:26:45,070
around as she does sort of typical girly

760
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:47,200
things make deliveries chat it up with

761
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,539
friends talk about boys all that good

762
00:26:49,539 --> 00:26:52,059
stuff and once again that's kind of all

763
00:26:52,059 --> 00:26:54,190
there is to it just watching the simple

764
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:56,320
life of this little witch I really love

765
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,179
how Miyazaki's worlds are just so

766
00:26:58,179 --> 00:26:59,889
accepting of these fantastic

767
00:26:59,889 --> 00:27:02,529
supernatural elements they just live in

768
00:27:02,529 --> 00:27:04,779
a world where witches are normal okay

769
00:27:04,779 --> 00:27:05,740
whatever

770
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:07,570
there's a whit flying around hi how you

771
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:09,730
doing at the same time they still ask

772
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:11,559
your questions and want to know things

773
00:27:11,559 --> 00:27:13,480
about her it gives a very clear

774
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,100
understanding of how they're accepted in

775
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,889
this world kirsten dunst is absolutely

776
00:27:17,889 --> 00:27:19,800
perfect as Kiki

777
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,870
never feels forced it never feels like

778
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:23,550
she's playing the role too young or too

779
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:26,550
old it seems like the perfect age all

780
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:28,620
the side actors are great too the only

781
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,930
one I might have an issue with is Phil

782
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:33,540
Hartman as the cat I don't know it's not

783
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:35,610
bad but there's always something about

784
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:37,770
his cynical sense of humor where you're

785
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:39,630
not sure if he's really taking the role

786
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:41,700
seriously or not a lot of people can

787
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,740
find that even funnier but I don't know

788
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:46,020
sometimes it seems a touch of pudding to

789
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:48,150
me but then again that's also kind of

790
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:50,310
the character so I'm up in the air about

791
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:52,350
it but it doesn't distract too much for

792
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:54,420
me I can see how people would enjoy him

793
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:56,550
your room is nice but let's take your

794
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:59,490
mother's you're no help if I did have a

795
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:01,470
problem it's once again kind of like my

796
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:03,600
neighbor totoro there's kind of a forest

797
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,940
climax at the end this one's even bigger

798
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,590
than my neighbor totoro because it's

799
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:10,020
like this great big action scene and on

800
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:12,090
the one hand yeah you have a character

801
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:14,040
that can fly around it kind of makes

802
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,150
sense to do something a little

803
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:17,340
action-oriented but it just kind of

804
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,350
comes out of the blue it's kind of

805
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:20,820
different from the rest of the feel of

806
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:23,640
the movie and I don't know it's not bad

807
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,380
I guess I just sort of feel like

808
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,630
couldn't you cut that out and leave sort

809
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:30,420
of the very low-key tone alone but then

810
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:32,670
again doesn't every movie kind of need

811
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:35,310
an ending and a third act to build some

812
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:37,590
conflict and drama I don't know there

813
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:39,660
must have been some other way to do this

814
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:42,240
it's not terrible it's just a touch

815
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,370
unfitting but the rest of the film like

816
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:46,530
I said it's just enjoying the very

817
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:48,960
simple but likeable life of this little

818
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,270
girl you get to know the town you get to

819
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:52,860
know the neighbors and the side

820
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:55,830
characters and of course she gets to fly

821
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:57,840
around and the flying shots are

822
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,150
wonderful I don't know what it is but

823
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:01,740
something about the way Japanese

824
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,360
animation does flying scenes that

825
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,370
they're very well done there's not even

826
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:07,650
a CG used here and yet somehow you

827
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:09,360
really feel like she's in the air

828
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,310
something about the angles and the

829
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:13,230
movement they get I'm not sure what the

830
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:15,900
magic formula is but they got it nailed

831
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:18,180
somehow the anime is so that you feel

832
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,830
the weight of the character that's

833
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:21,960
actually flying and I don't know how you

834
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,780
do that but they found a way look at how

835
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:27,180
she drops here you feel the gravity in

836
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:27,860
that scene

837
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:30,320
like I said I'm not entirely sure why I

838
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,970
like this one more than my neighbor

839
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:34,130
totoro but something about it really did

840
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:36,230
grab me maybe it's because she does

841
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:38,090
explore a little bit more and she does

842
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:40,100
have to travel but at the same time you

843
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,779
get an idea about how this world works

844
00:29:41,779 --> 00:29:44,299
and how people accept witches and yeah

845
00:29:44,299 --> 00:29:45,710
you almost got a while live in this

846
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:47,870
world it seems so simple and relaxed

847
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:50,029
that you really enjoy being there you

848
00:29:50,029 --> 00:29:51,500
kind of want to sit with this artist and

849
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,450
talk about what she's painting you can't

850
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:55,159
help this old lady bake something for

851
00:29:55,159 --> 00:29:56,929
her granddaughter's birthday and you

852
00:29:56,929 --> 00:29:58,309
really get bummed out when the daughter

853
00:29:58,309 --> 00:29:59,990
actually doesn't like the thing that she

854
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:01,340
begs and you're just like come on yes

855
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,870
boy a little brat what's wrong with you

856
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:04,070
she worked really hard for that you

857
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:06,590
ungrateful little bitch you see what I

858
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:09,380
mean somehow I get really wrapped up in

859
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:11,480
these tiny little problems that's going

860
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,370
on in this town and with this one girl

861
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:16,130
but screw it I'm with her it's like just

862
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:17,419
sitting through a little bit of real

863
00:30:17,419 --> 00:30:19,549
life and yet somehow with this

864
00:30:19,549 --> 00:30:21,769
supernatural character it's such a weird

865
00:30:21,769 --> 00:30:23,690
combo but for whatever reason it really

866
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:26,330
works I can't even think of any other

867
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:28,940
words to describe it except delightful

868
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:31,490
it's just friggin delightful I love

869
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:33,289
being with these people I love being in

870
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:35,990
this town I love flying around it and I

871
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:37,370
like seeing it from the point of view of

872
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:39,380
this wide-eyed adventurous innocent

873
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:41,779
she's just friggin adorable I love it

874
00:30:41,779 --> 00:30:43,429
when she gets a package delivered I love

875
00:30:43,429 --> 00:30:44,990
it when she gives that one chef a hug

876
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:46,880
for making that little delivery sign out

877
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,889
of bread I love it when she laughs well

878
00:30:48,889 --> 00:30:50,240
they almost got killed writing that

879
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,220
weird fan bike thing with that weird

880
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:55,250
inventor boy and just I can't help it

881
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:58,460
it's just irresistible so like I said if

882
00:30:58,460 --> 00:30:59,809
you're not a fan of these kind of

883
00:30:59,809 --> 00:31:01,970
stories that well don't have much of a

884
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:03,710
story and mostly just atmosphere and

885
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:05,269
character you probably won't get that

886
00:31:05,269 --> 00:31:08,179
sucked in but me I enjoyed every minute

887
00:31:08,179 --> 00:31:08,809
of it

888
00:31:08,809 --> 00:31:10,580
I love that they feel they didn't have

889
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,380
to stick to the formula of a three-act

890
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:14,029
structure that they could just show a

891
00:31:14,029 --> 00:31:16,940
little bit of life being lived sometimes

892
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:19,309
just experiencing what somebody is going

893
00:31:19,309 --> 00:31:20,630
through it's more exciting than being

894
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:22,669
told what they're going through you get

895
00:31:22,669 --> 00:31:24,470
more sucked into a world when it feels

896
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:26,360
more real and reality doesn't always

897
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,309
have these three act structures or these

898
00:31:28,309 --> 00:31:30,440
clever lines sometimes it's just a

899
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:33,049
little bit of life playing its way films

900
00:31:33,049 --> 00:31:35,120
like Bambi Winnie the Pooh Christmas

901
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,549
Story the Sandlot they all knew that

902
00:31:37,549 --> 00:31:40,039
and I think Kiki does too for me it was

903
00:31:40,039 --> 00:31:41,330
the perfect little adventure that made

904
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:48,500
my appreciation of Miyazaki a lot bigger

905
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:58,600
[Music]

906
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,930
[Music]

907
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:04,120
sometimes a movie needs a pig that is

908
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,490
the only reason I can think that they

909
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:08,560
actually put a pig as the main star of

910
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,700
Porco Rosso

911
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,740
a charming little film about a rogue

912
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:14,140
World War 1 veteran pilot who gets into

913
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,540
trouble flies around fights off debts as

914
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:18,520
well as air pirates comes across all

915
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:21,520
sorts of cool characters and is also a

916
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:24,040
pig and truth be told there is pretty

917
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,930
much no reason for him to be a pig I

918
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:27,670
mean don't get me wrong I know it's

919
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:30,010
symbolic it's a curse it's something

920
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:32,470
that he has to overcome but really if

921
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:34,360
you wrote that out it wouldn't make

922
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,700
little to no difference it's not like my

923
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,890
neighbor totoro or kiki where they can

924
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:41,110
do all sorts of cool big supernatural

925
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:43,510
things it's just he's a guy who happens

926
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:46,390
to be a pig I just don't get the point

927
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:48,730
of it the film is about a pilot under

928
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:50,200
the same name who's trying to make a

929
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,820
living but is constantly chased down by

930
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:54,220
people he owes money to he's constantly

931
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:56,140
relaxing at a hotel run by a friend

932
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,000
named Gina and is constantly being

933
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,610
bugged by an egotist named Curtis along

934
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:02,500
his travels he gets shot down and eats

935
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,270
his plane repaired by his ole mechanic

936
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:06,130
friend but he's not doing much work

937
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:07,570
anymore so he hands it off to his

938
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:09,790
daughter named vo skeptical for ability

939
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:11,950
she proves herself to be not only good

940
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:14,020
but downright brilliant at what she does

941
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:16,360
soon Porco starts to realize she has the

942
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,190
same diabolical brain that he does and

943
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:19,750
start working well off each other and

944
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:21,610
start planning ways to continue their

945
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:23,620
mischievous adventures but once Curtis

946
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,780
challenges him to one final duel they

947
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:28,000
make a deal if porca wins Curtis will

948
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,160
agree to pay off all of his debts but if

949
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,260
he loses Pheo throws herself in as the

950
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,180
prize and agrees to marry him will

951
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:36,070
Porco's confidence get him through or

952
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:38,050
will the demons of the past distract him

953
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:40,510
from the bigger goal in many respects

954
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:42,700
it's much more like the calmer Miyazaki

955
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,470
projects I mean true there is a lot

956
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:46,900
flying around and gunfire and stuff but

957
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,420
it's not for say a war or something on a

958
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:51,580
grand scale in Nautica it's more along

959
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:54,070
the lines of tailspin that kind of stuff

960
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:56,410
yeah there's violence but it's all kind

961
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:57,000
of place

962
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,159
the characters once again are all really

963
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:01,260
funny and really memorable the dubbing

964
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:03,330
is very well done with Michael Keaton as

965
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:05,490
the lead although not as sexy as that

966
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:14,730
American flag flies sharp but once again

967
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:17,190
I just don't get why this characters a

968
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:19,830
pig and the story he's cursed because he

969
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:21,929
fled away like a coward that's sort of a

970
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:23,340
debate at the end whether or not the

971
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:25,109
curse is actually lifted which I like

972
00:34:25,109 --> 00:34:29,099
that but I why a pig could you do

973
00:34:29,099 --> 00:34:31,200
something a lot more imaginative with

974
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,270
this couldn't be like a monster with

975
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:35,250
five arms and that way you can animate

976
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:36,060
them in a fun way

977
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:38,190
could you make him like a giant fly so

978
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:40,379
he can fly around already or couldn't

979
00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:42,540
you do that I don't know what can you do

980
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:45,000
with a pig even the people around him

981
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,679
don't seem to care they're just like oh

982
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:49,500
yeah we know him he's a pig whatever and

983
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,240
like I said in most Miyazaki projects

984
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,980
that's part of the charm but here it

985
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:55,349
just doesn't seem to affect anything you

986
00:34:55,349 --> 00:34:56,790
could just as easily have him be a

987
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:59,190
normal pilot with just a scar on his

988
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:00,690
hand or something like in Princess

989
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:03,359
Mononoke the only thing I can figure is

990
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,040
maybe they just wanted a little bit more

991
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,869
of an identity for the film like a

992
00:35:06,869 --> 00:35:09,390
visual identity like you can look at the

993
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:12,150
poster and be like a pig fly wah I'll

994
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:14,640
believe that when pigs fly oh wait yeah

995
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,099
I guess that's the joke but it just kind

996
00:35:17,099 --> 00:35:18,869
of seems like a middle that doesn't have

997
00:35:18,869 --> 00:35:20,760
a whole bunch of possibilities either

998
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,830
making something really grand or crazy

999
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:24,599
or have what he's cursed with just

1000
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:26,430
something very subtle but like I said

1001
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:28,710
before that by no means makes it a bad

1002
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,630
movie for all the dogfights a

1003
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:32,640
machine-gun fire in this it's actually

1004
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,650
very very relaxed it's just the

1005
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:36,300
characters being really charming and

1006
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,070
working off each other having pleasant

1007
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:40,200
conversations the writing's decent dee

1008
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,990
acting's decent it's all good I just

1009
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:45,599
don't get the main creative choice but

1010
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:47,460
maybe I don't need to because the film

1011
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:49,470
is still a lot of fun regardless I don't

1012
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:51,930
think I like it quite as much as Kiki

1013
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:53,820
because like I said they do take more

1014
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,800
advantage of the idea but still

1015
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,540
enjoyable and we're seeing at least once

1016
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:59,670
he'll the animation is so good maybe

1017
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:01,619
it's evil we're seeing twice if you want

1018
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:02,640
a film that has a little bit of

1019
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,830
excitement a lot of humor but still at

1020
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:06,990
its heart just kind of lay back this is

1021
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:08,630
definitely a good one to check out

1022
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:14,460
[Music]

1023
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:24,290
[Applause]

1024
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:25,730
[Music]

1025
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:29,970
by popular demand pom Poko I wish I had

1026
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:32,190
a better excuse as to why I didn't

1027
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,810
include this in the original Disney

1028
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:36,480
cember but honestly I just forgot I

1029
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,310
thought I had scheduled but then when I

1030
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:39,690
looked over the list it looked like it

1031
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:41,760
wasn't on there so I said okay we'll get

1032
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,920
to it now the film itself is anything

1033
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,750
but forgettable with a very distinct and

1034
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:47,880
entertaining story pom Poko is about a

1035
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,950
bunch of raccoons or tanukis who are

1036
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:51,540
constantly fighting for their land that

1037
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:53,400
is trying to be taken over by the humans

1038
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,890
however the angle in this isn't quite as

1039
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:58,440
dramatic as say Princess Mononoke it's

1040
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,300
actually got a lot more comedy as more a

1041
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,940
beat for the most part when you think

1042
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:04,530
about bunch of raccoons trying to attack

1043
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:05,820
humans you don't really think of that

1044
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:08,310
much variety but again remember this is

1045
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:10,170
Japanese lore and the tanukis could

1046
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:12,690
shape-shift yeah remember a Mario 3 how

1047
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:14,070
we could always turn to a statue in the

1048
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:16,079
Tanooki suit well this is the same idea

1049
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:18,119
the raccoons can not only turn into

1050
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:19,680
people but they can also bend and shape

1051
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,690
their body however they want the only

1052
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:23,280
problem is a lot of them have forgotten

1053
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,319
how and with the land constantly being

1054
00:37:25,319 --> 00:37:27,060
destroyed more and more every day they

1055
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:29,010
send out to the elders to show them how

1056
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:31,140
to do it once more the elders of course

1057
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,640
teach them well and it's a constant

1058
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,530
battle back and forth to see who can

1059
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:36,210
keep the land and who's going to lose

1060
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:38,099
it'd be much more comedic these

1061
00:37:38,099 --> 00:37:40,079
characters end up being very likable and

1062
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:42,180
very funny it's almost like watching a

1063
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,950
Looney Tunes cartoon just seeing these

1064
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:46,170
big eyed fluffy animals constantly go

1065
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:47,970
against people and allow them screaming

1066
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:50,250
and yelling and running around flailing

1067
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:52,109
their arms and making jokes back and

1068
00:37:52,109 --> 00:37:53,790
forth it always keeps the energy really

1069
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:56,099
high but at the same time it has a lot

1070
00:37:56,099 --> 00:37:57,599
of character too you do get to know

1071
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:59,730
these raccoons and their personalities

1072
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:01,079
and you like how they work off each

1073
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:03,270
other and how celebratory they are and

1074
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:04,740
how they always get along for the most

1075
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,420
part and they're always going on

1076
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,980
adventures and you don't want to see

1077
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,869
them lose their land the voice-acting

1078
00:38:09,869 --> 00:38:11,490
doesn't have this may celebrities as

1079
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:13,260
much as natural voiceover artists like

1080
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,819
trans McNeill Maurice LaMarche

1081
00:38:14,819 --> 00:38:16,619
but they do fit in a few names like

1082
00:38:16,619 --> 00:38:18,359
Jonathan Taylor Thomas and JK Simmons

1083
00:38:18,359 --> 00:38:20,130
and they all do fine for what's required

1084
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:22,710
the only thing I might have a little bit

1085
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:24,060
of an issue with is that there's a

1086
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:26,330
surprisingly kind of high death toll

1087
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:28,340
in this movie yeah it doesn't look like

1088
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:29,930
it and in some ways the tone doesn't

1089
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:31,970
even act like it but a lot of characters

1090
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:34,250
die in this both people and raccoons

1091
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:36,470
some have a heavy impact but others are

1092
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:38,240
just kind of a glance in the sentence on

1093
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,070
the one hand I say this kind of gets in

1094
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:41,960
the way with the light-handed tone but

1095
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,520
then on the other hand we don't really

1096
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,050
question that much when we see storm

1097
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:46,370
troopers falling to their deaths

1098
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:48,950
constantly okay maybe a little bit of

1099
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:51,050
dark reality can help - it doesn't

1100
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:53,030
totally run the tone just once in a

1101
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:55,070
while it's a touch distracting and oh

1102
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:57,260
yeah let's talk about this elephant in

1103
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:59,150
the room for anyone that has seen the

1104
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:01,040
original Japanese version there's a

1105
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:04,930
scene that you might find a little um

1106
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:06,830
when they're finding out what their

1107
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:08,360
bodies can do and what they can make

1108
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,610
shape-shift they find out something very

1109
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:13,730
bizarrely unique they can blow up their

1110
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:16,880
genitalia to an incredible size yep

1111
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,560
those big things that they're bouncing

1112
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,510
off of that's supposed to be their

1113
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:24,590
private parts um different cultures I

1114
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:27,410
guess again on the one hand I can see a

1115
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:29,360
bunch of kids laughing at this oh isn't

1116
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,980
that funny they're using their private

1117
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:33,080
parts and making the big TV ha ha but on

1118
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,700
the other hand Jesus Christ they're

1119
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:37,190
using their private parts now to be fair

1120
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:38,570
they don't really look that much like

1121
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:39,800
their private parts seeing how they're

1122
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,180
playing with the size and shape and

1123
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:42,890
everything but this is still kind of

1124
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:44,840
 up I remember why I saw this in

1125
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,700
Japanese I said well there went the

1126
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,650
chances for an English dub there but

1127
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:50,270
nevertheless Disney still picked it up

1128
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:51,920
so I remember thinking to myself how the

1129
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,810
hell are they got tap-dance that little

1130
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:55,820
bit well apparently in this version now

1131
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:59,030
two new keys have pouches yep that's

1132
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:01,460
their way around it and in all fairness

1133
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:03,650
I don't think it's actually that bad

1134
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:05,780
away around it I mean come on even

1135
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,640
taking the Disney equation out of it

1136
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,470
wouldn't you be a little uncomfortable

1137
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:12,560
if American audiences saw raccoons using

1138
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,480
their junk to fight people different

1139
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,950
cultures I understand but as someone who

1140
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:18,320
grew up in this culture yeah that would

1141
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,850
never get a market and instead would be

1142
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:22,310
replaced with a ton of angry parents so

1143
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:23,690
I actually think it was a very clever

1144
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:25,610
solution but whether they keep that in

1145
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:27,440
or they don't it's still a very highly

1146
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,300
entertaining movie most of it is just

1147
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:31,070
watching them trying to stop the humans

1148
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:32,570
from taking over the land and trying to

1149
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:34,580
show the value of what they have very

1150
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:36,530
simple but very effective and very funny

1151
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:38,900
sometimes it gets a touch heavy-handed

1152
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:39,710
like the main character

1153
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:41,390
actually looks at the camera at the end

1154
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:42,890
and speaks to the audience saying the

1155
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:44,780
very obvious message but for the most

1156
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:46,400
part it's just a really enjoyable

1157
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,890
adventure with a ton of creativity and a

1158
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:51,230
lot of imagination it's also nice to see

1159
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:53,180
Studio Ghibli do kind of a different

1160
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:54,560
story something that doesn't take place

1161
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,660
in a fantasy world that has fantasy

1162
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:58,339
characters and they're not human they're

1163
00:40:58,339 --> 00:41:00,109
all animals I don't really see that from

1164
00:41:00,109 --> 00:41:01,400
Ghibli to much where all the main

1165
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,540
characters are animals

1166
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:04,160
it's got good characters with a good

1167
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,080
plot and a good moral it's definitely a

1168
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,119
lot of fun to check out transform into

1169
00:41:08,119 --> 00:41:09,589
something that's fast and check it out

1170
00:41:09,589 --> 00:41:25,070
for yourself whispers of the heart

1171
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:27,530
doesn't get a lot of attention but it

1172
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:29,900
probably should because for what it is

1173
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:32,089
it does it very well a coming-of-age

1174
00:41:32,089 --> 00:41:34,820
story about a girl learning about life

1175
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:38,240
and romance and growing up and parents

1176
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,550
and family and friends all that stuff

1177
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:42,440
yeah I know what you're thinking haven't

1178
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,570
we seen this a million other times and a

1179
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:46,460
million other movies made for teenagers

1180
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:49,520
and tweens and they're always done awful

1181
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,290
and they're always super sappy and

1182
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:54,320
cliched well well there are a few corny

1183
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,210
moments here and there I think this is

1184
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:58,160
actually a very well-done film that

1185
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,470
really addresses the age I think it very

1186
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:02,030
much shows the battle going out with a

1187
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:03,589
lot of young people between their

1188
00:42:03,589 --> 00:42:05,300
passion and what they should most likely

1189
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:07,160
do with their lives our main character

1190
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:09,260
is names Shizuku she's a bookworm who

1191
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,060
loves to write and discovers one day

1192
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:12,380
that all her favorite books are checked

1193
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:14,570
out by another person she starts to

1194
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:16,250
daydream about who this person is but

1195
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:18,470
then realizes it's a boy she can stand

1196
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:20,930
over time of course they both start to

1197
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:22,700
lower their defenses and they realize

1198
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:24,770
they actually really like each other but

1199
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:25,970
that's only one part of the story

1200
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:28,010
another part involves her discovering

1201
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:29,780
this antique shop were all sorts of

1202
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:31,700
statues and beautiful items give her

1203
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:33,890
ideas for stories she befriends the

1204
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:35,660
owner and starts to find there's a real

1205
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:37,820
magic to the place at least in a way

1206
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:40,520
that inspires her imagination so much so

1207
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,230
that she's now determined to become a

1208
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:44,420
full-time writer even at her young age

1209
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:46,400
she tells her parents she wants to drop

1210
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,810
out of school and spend all her time

1211
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:50,359
trying to write her perfect story the

1212
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:51,830
parents respectful that she wants to

1213
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:53,030
choose her own path

1214
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:55,610
perhaps even a little too respectful

1215
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:58,040
allow her to leave for a bit so she can

1216
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:00,650
do exactly that yeah some would argue

1217
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:03,890
not the best choice but then again she

1218
00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:06,260
does obviously learn her lesson and I

1219
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:07,940
don't know it's a little controversial

1220
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:09,860
but it's an interesting talking point

1221
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:11,810
and once again that's kind of a very

1222
00:43:11,810 --> 00:43:13,970
simple story we're just following her

1223
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:15,800
around seeing what her life is like as

1224
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,540
she herself is trying to figure out what

1225
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:19,610
her life is like where is she going what

1226
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:21,380
does she want to do what's our destiny

1227
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:23,330
what's her calling all that fun stuff

1228
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:25,250
that teenagers ask themselves a million

1229
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:27,200
times when they're younger the film has

1230
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,150
a lot of charm and even a lot of drama

1231
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:31,760
but as before there's not a ton of story

1232
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,590
so again if this is something that

1233
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:35,660
doesn't grab ya you can probably pick it

1234
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:37,700
up very quick but I personally saw it as

1235
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:40,010
one of those annoying teen rob stories

1236
00:43:40,010 --> 00:43:41,690
that were constantly advertised in

1237
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:44,540
America in the early 2000s and hell even

1238
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:46,850
nowadays I'm sure that's actually done

1239
00:43:46,850 --> 00:43:48,860
right and done with respect to its main

1240
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:50,660
characters and just young people in

1241
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:51,110
general

1242
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:53,810
you kind of get sucked into her stories

1243
00:43:53,810 --> 00:43:55,880
you really enjoy her relationship with

1244
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,920
the man who owns the shop you kind of

1245
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,020
hope in a strange way maybe her and the

1246
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:02,270
boyfriend can get together even though

1247
00:44:02,270 --> 00:44:04,310
they may not be perfect or maybe they

1248
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:06,530
are perfect I don't know it's young love

1249
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:08,540
and that's the point of it even the

1250
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:10,490
corny scenes I mean like the really

1251
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:13,610
corny scenes are still so damn likable

1252
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:15,230
there's a scene where they're trying to

1253
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:17,210
learn this American song and they're

1254
00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:19,490
trying to learn it in English which yeah

1255
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:22,190
is a little weird with an American dub

1256
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:23,900
but I think you can still catch on to

1257
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:25,490
what they're doing and as they're trying

1258
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:27,050
to sing the song all of a sudden all

1259
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:28,640
these guys are just getting back from a

1260
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,290
concert and they hear her singing so

1261
00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:32,420
what do they do they all go down and

1262
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:34,550
they start playing with her oh my god

1263
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:37,670
this is so silly and hokey but I can't

1264
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:40,820
help it it's just so likable maybe it's

1265
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:42,380
because the rest of the atmosphere of

1266
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:44,510
the film is just so down to earth and so

1267
00:44:44,510 --> 00:44:45,980
mellow so that when something like this

1268
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:48,860
happens that is pretty cheesy you kind

1269
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:50,690
of accept it because it doesn't happen

1270
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:52,970
that much in this film a kind of corny

1271
00:44:52,970 --> 00:44:55,070
moment can play okay as long as the rest

1272
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:58,070
of it is mostly grounded in reality it

1273
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:00,500
doesn't go for too many obvious labs or

1274
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:02,870
to may traditionally dramatic moments it

1275
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:04,410
instead tries to capture that

1276
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:06,450
age when possibility starts to meet the

1277
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:08,880
real world when dreams can be dashed but

1278
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,410
what you discover that just means new

1279
00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:12,630
ones can open up the voice acting once

1280
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:14,880
again is very nicely done I heard the

1281
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,170
girls that were best friends in this

1282
00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:17,640
were actually best friends in real life

1283
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,320
so they worked off each other much more

1284
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,810
naturally they even got Cary Elwes for

1285
00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:23,640
this one throwaway role that actually

1286
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:25,950
plays a bigger part in a later movie but

1287
00:45:25,950 --> 00:45:27,390
we'll get to that when we get to that

1288
00:45:27,390 --> 00:45:28,920
it's actually clever that they brought

1289
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:31,260
him in for just a few lines but again I

1290
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:32,670
can't say too much until we get to the

1291
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:35,040
later film if I do have one problem with

1292
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,260
the film is that the ending is really

1293
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:39,090
sporadic out of nowhere and really fast

1294
00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:41,850
I mean there's like no lead-in to the

1295
00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:43,650
credit it's like somebody says a line

1296
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:45,600
and then suddenly we're against these

1297
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:46,980
pretty buildings with a nice song

1298
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:48,540
playing with the credits rolling

1299
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:50,400
there's no segue there's no fade to

1300
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,200
black there's no nothing it just jumps

1301
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,810
straight to it and yeah I gotta get the

1302
00:45:54,810 --> 00:45:56,970
idea what the final line it's puppy love

1303
00:45:56,970 --> 00:45:59,940
it's that age it's all about falling in

1304
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:02,130
love at the certain point in time and

1305
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:04,290
how you are and you rush into things

1306
00:46:04,290 --> 00:46:06,570
it's still weird but still the rest of

1307
00:46:06,570 --> 00:46:08,970
the film is really charming really nice

1308
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:11,220
really laid-back I feel very much

1309
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:13,380
captures an age that isn't life or death

1310
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:16,350
but rather just discovery influence and

1311
00:46:16,350 --> 00:46:18,540
making mistakes here and there it's kind

1312
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:20,280
of all those things you want to see in

1313
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,290
those popular coming-of-age stories that

1314
00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:24,360
are also kind of corny but they're done

1315
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:26,730
right it's soothing it's enjoyable and

1316
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:28,640
it's definitely worth checking out

[Music]

1319
00:46:45,529 --> 00:46:48,749
it's what many consider Hayao Miyazaki's

1320
00:46:48,749 --> 00:46:51,109
grandest masterpiece Princess Mononoke

1321
00:46:51,109 --> 00:46:54,390
this was one of the first major releases

1322
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:57,059
in America Miyazaki's work originally

1323
00:46:57,059 --> 00:46:59,069
under Miramax in getting one hell of a

1324
00:46:59,069 --> 00:47:01,380
cast to read of it Mononoke was the

1325
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:03,719
highest-grossing film in Japan until

1326
00:47:03,719 --> 00:47:05,670
Titanic came along and that's how they

1327
00:47:05,670 --> 00:47:07,709
marketed it for a while what is in this

1328
00:47:07,709 --> 00:47:09,359
film I got so much of the Japanese

1329
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:12,150
culture coming back to it going in I was

1330
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:14,430
pretty hyped up and after it was done I

1331
00:47:14,430 --> 00:47:18,209
definitely liked it a lot maybe not to

1332
00:47:18,209 --> 00:47:23,910
the level everyone else liked it the

1333
00:47:23,910 --> 00:47:26,130
prints of a village named ashitaka tries

1334
00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:28,499
to stop a demon from attacking it after

1335
00:47:28,499 --> 00:47:30,029
his arm gets touched by the demon he

1336
00:47:30,029 --> 00:47:31,739
finds out that he's doomed to die

1337
00:47:31,739 --> 00:47:33,719
because meant at what pace will it

1338
00:47:33,719 --> 00:47:35,219
consume him and how much of its strength

1339
00:47:35,219 --> 00:47:37,049
will take that all depends on how much

1340
00:47:37,049 --> 00:47:38,549
he contained the part of the demon

1341
00:47:38,549 --> 00:47:40,680
that's forever gonna be inside him he

1342
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:42,930
decides to set out on a quest - as he

1343
00:47:42,930 --> 00:47:44,999
puts it see you with eyes unclouded by

1344
00:47:44,999 --> 00:47:47,579
hate when he discovers as a war going on

1345
00:47:47,579 --> 00:47:49,769
between the human world and the world of

1346
00:47:49,769 --> 00:47:51,839
the forest filled with animals and gods

1347
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:53,999
the humans want to make a prosperous

1348
00:47:53,999 --> 00:47:56,190
future for themselves while the animals

1349
00:47:56,190 --> 00:47:57,989
and the gods of the forest want them to

1350
00:47:57,989 --> 00:48:00,029
leave he comes across an industrial

1351
00:48:00,029 --> 00:48:02,039
leader voiced by Minnie Driver who wants

1352
00:48:02,039 --> 00:48:03,599
to cut off the head of the spirit of the

1353
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:05,130
forest Allah have no more trouble from

1354
00:48:05,130 --> 00:48:07,469
them one of the forces greatest fighters

1355
00:48:07,469 --> 00:48:09,089
the queen of the wolves and her half

1356
00:48:09,089 --> 00:48:10,890
human half wolf daughter are at the

1357
00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:12,449
forefront of trying to stop her and

1358
00:48:12,449 --> 00:48:14,999
regain balance back to nature oh well ah

1359
00:48:14,999 --> 00:48:16,859
she talked I is caught in the middle not

1360
00:48:16,859 --> 00:48:18,420
knowing which side to choose and not

1361
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:21,059
knowing which foe to fight the movie has

1362
00:48:21,059 --> 00:48:23,219
a lot going for it in fact I think you

1363
00:48:23,219 --> 00:48:25,049
could argue this is probably Miyazaki's

1364
00:48:25,049 --> 00:48:27,420
most adult work not just because of the

1365
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:29,009
violence and gore though there is quite

1366
00:48:29,009 --> 00:48:30,989
a bit of it but because it's message is

1367
00:48:30,989 --> 00:48:34,019
not so obvious and blatant at least not

1368
00:48:34,019 --> 00:48:35,940
in terms of movies that died in the past

1369
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:38,699
what's the route this could so easily go

1370
00:48:38,699 --> 00:48:41,420
the Fern Gully Dances with Wolves

1371
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:44,400
Pocahontas avatar where the

1372
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,440
humans are evil nature is good at the

1373
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,089
end but one of the great things about

1374
00:48:48,089 --> 00:48:49,829
this film is that there is no real

1375
00:48:49,829 --> 00:48:50,980
villain even

1376
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:53,200
the drivers character is very likeable

1377
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,210
she's helping to cure the sick she's a

1378
00:48:55,210 --> 00:48:56,980
great motivator she brings people

1379
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:57,820
together

1380
00:48:57,820 --> 00:48:59,560
she knows the tragedy of war and she

1381
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:01,300
listens to the people who have lost so

1382
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:03,490
much there's also other side characters

1383
00:49:03,490 --> 00:49:05,530
that could so easily just be seen as

1384
00:49:05,530 --> 00:49:07,420
villains but they put it very straight

1385
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:09,250
forward that there are no real bad guys

1386
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:11,050
in this world there's just people trying

1387
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:13,180
to get what they can trying to survive

1388
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:14,650
trying to be comfortable trying to be

1389
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:17,109
prosperous it's a very human as well as

1390
00:49:17,109 --> 00:49:19,330
animalistic trait and that's part of

1391
00:49:19,330 --> 00:49:21,070
what makes it so clever it's showing

1392
00:49:21,070 --> 00:49:22,869
that the humans and the animals are very

1393
00:49:22,869 --> 00:49:25,330
much alike but not in the same way that

1394
00:49:25,330 --> 00:49:27,040
oh we shouldn't fight them because we're

1395
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:29,140
so similar but in the way that this is

1396
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:31,150
the reason why we're fighting because we

1397
00:49:31,150 --> 00:49:32,890
are too similar and we both want the

1398
00:49:32,890 --> 00:49:35,170
same thing lots of land and lots of

1399
00:49:35,170 --> 00:49:37,990
means to survive a very long time it's

1400
00:49:37,990 --> 00:49:39,580
funny because when I review Nausicaa a

1401
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:41,500
lot of people were comparing it to this

1402
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:43,630
movie like which one did it better which

1403
00:49:43,630 --> 00:49:45,490
one was stronger and a lot of people

1404
00:49:45,490 --> 00:49:47,590
seem to lean towards this one in a sense

1405
00:49:47,590 --> 00:49:50,470
I kind of agree I think this movie has

1406
00:49:50,470 --> 00:49:51,790
much better characters

1407
00:49:51,790 --> 00:49:53,530
I think its message is a little bit more

1408
00:49:53,530 --> 00:49:56,020
direct but it's also a little smarter it

1409
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:57,700
ties in much more to what's happening

1410
00:49:57,700 --> 00:49:59,560
nowadays and will probably happen in the

1411
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:00,100
future

1412
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:02,500
where Nausicaa had this really big story

1413
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,150
that went all over the place and could

1414
00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:06,280
kind of do it because it was so large

1415
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:08,710
and scale Mononoke feels like a smaller

1416
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:10,900
story yet kind of tries to do the same

1417
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:13,900
thing it goes everywhere and back again

1418
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:15,850
we cut back to so many of these same

1419
00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:18,520
locations like three or four times and

1420
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:19,660
don't get me wrong I like these

1421
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:21,700
locations but there's only so many times

1422
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:23,830
I can see our main character walk back

1423
00:50:23,830 --> 00:50:25,750
and forth between them it was definitely

1424
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:27,550
a film where before the climax I was

1425
00:50:27,550 --> 00:50:29,350
kind of looking at my watch saying huh

1426
00:50:29,350 --> 00:50:32,380
how long is this movie nothing I wasn't

1427
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:33,850
enjoying it but I was definitely

1428
00:50:33,850 --> 00:50:36,430
noticing the length and definitely felt

1429
00:50:36,430 --> 00:50:38,530
it could have been cut at least 10-15

1430
00:50:38,530 --> 00:50:40,690
minutes just take out a couple more

1431
00:50:40,690 --> 00:50:42,700
scenes of him running to the other side

1432
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:45,490
saying wait stop also as much as I love

1433
00:50:45,490 --> 00:50:47,170
the characters in this I do think

1434
00:50:47,170 --> 00:50:49,480
there's one that's surprisingly not very

1435
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:51,640
interesting and believe it or not it's

1436
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:54,130
Mononoke I don't think she's a very

1437
00:50:54,130 --> 00:50:56,380
interesting character and she should be

1438
00:50:56,380 --> 00:50:59,470
half human half wolf constantly torn

1439
00:50:59,470 --> 00:51:01,300
between what she is and who she's

1440
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:03,430
supposed to be this should be great for

1441
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:03,670
the

1442
00:51:03,670 --> 00:51:05,260
character they should be able to talk

1443
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:07,480
and share stories and be able to relate

1444
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:09,609
unbelievably they're both kind of going

1445
00:51:09,609 --> 00:51:11,410
through the same thing but most of her

1446
00:51:11,410 --> 00:51:13,510
dialogue voice by Claire Danes is mostly

1447
00:51:13,510 --> 00:51:16,150
gesture shouting no no I'm a wolf no no

1448
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:18,400
I'm a wolf which is so strange because

1449
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,740
Miyazaki is so good at these kind of

1450
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:22,750
characters the young heroine who's

1451
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:24,400
action-packed but doesn't know which

1452
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,650
route to take he usually writes them so

1453
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:29,440
well but this one is just so whiny I

1454
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,869
have no idea why the film is named after

1455
00:51:31,869 --> 00:51:34,059
her it woulda been neat and she played

1456
00:51:34,059 --> 00:51:36,099
as big a part as I she taka it would

1457
00:51:36,099 --> 00:51:37,240
have been nice if she was just as

1458
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:39,940
complex as he was but as is she just

1459
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:42,069
didn't do anything for me I know that's

1460
00:51:42,069 --> 00:51:43,990
so weird because she's like the big icon

1461
00:51:43,990 --> 00:51:46,210
from the film but outside of her design

1462
00:51:46,210 --> 00:51:47,829
I think she's a real missed opportunity

1463
00:51:47,829 --> 00:51:50,230
but thankfully like I said before the

1464
00:51:50,230 --> 00:51:51,190
rest of the characters are very

1465
00:51:51,190 --> 00:51:53,770
interesting and their dilemmas are very

1466
00:51:53,770 --> 00:51:55,809
understandable and relatable this is

1467
00:51:55,809 --> 00:51:57,609
about the majesty of the forest and the

1468
00:51:57,609 --> 00:52:00,040
majesty of mankind both evolving too

1469
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:01,780
fast for their own good and trying to

1470
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:03,880
figure out where to level out I do

1471
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:05,530
really like this film and there's even

1472
00:52:05,530 --> 00:52:07,809
elements of it I absolutely love I think

1473
00:52:07,809 --> 00:52:09,790
if it was just a bit shorter a little

1474
00:52:09,790 --> 00:52:12,400
less complicated and the Mononoke

1475
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,349
character was made more interesting it

1476
00:52:14,349 --> 00:52:16,390
could have been something phenomenal at

1477
00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:18,549
least from my standpoint I know to a lot

1478
00:52:18,549 --> 00:52:20,410
of people this is phenomenal and I can

1479
00:52:20,410 --> 00:52:22,750
totally see why the voice acting the

1480
00:52:22,750 --> 00:52:24,970
imagination the writing it's a strong

1481
00:52:24,970 --> 00:52:27,280
piece I guess I just don't quite see it

1482
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,020
as the masterpiece that everybody else

1483
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:31,329
builds it up to be I do have issues with

1484
00:52:31,329 --> 00:52:32,890
it that hold me back from absolutely

1485
00:52:32,890 --> 00:52:34,660
adoring it but the stuff that's good

1486
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:36,640
it's just too damn good to overlook

1487
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:39,040
whether you love it like it think it's

1488
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:40,809
mediocre or even don't like it at all

1489
00:52:40,809 --> 00:52:42,579
it's a good film to check out because

1490
00:52:42,579 --> 00:52:44,170
there's just too many interesting things

1491
00:52:44,170 --> 00:52:46,480
in it I can't see anybody going to see

1492
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:47,740
this film and just saying there was

1493
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:49,809
nothing to get out of it it's an

1494
00:52:49,809 --> 00:52:51,339
impressive feat and everybody should

1495
00:52:51,339 --> 00:52:53,680
check it out at some point I just can't

1496
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:55,150
call it the Lawrence of Arabia of

1497
00:52:55,150 --> 00:52:57,309
animation like everybody else does but I

1498
00:52:57,309 --> 00:52:58,750
still think it's a pretty damn good

1499
00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:00,609
movie the animation alone is

1500
00:53:00,609 --> 00:53:03,130
breathtakingly impressive so go find a

1501
00:53:03,130 --> 00:53:05,049
copy give it a watch and see what all

1502
00:53:05,049 --> 00:53:06,810
the animation buffs are talking about

1503
00:53:06,810 --> 00:53:13,150
[Music]

1504
00:53:13,150 --> 00:53:25,010
[Music]

1505
00:53:25,010 --> 00:53:27,090
[Music]

1506
00:53:27,090 --> 00:53:29,620
it's no secret that Hollywood has been

1507
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:31,420
out of original ideas for a while

1508
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:34,030
everything is either based on a comic or

1509
00:53:34,030 --> 00:53:36,550
a book or a popular series or a TV show

1510
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:38,800
everything is retro and based off of

1511
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,020
something and well a lot of good stuff

1512
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:42,910
has come from it it is kind of a shame

1513
00:53:42,910 --> 00:53:44,800
that we don't really see that much new

1514
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:47,050
stuff coming out but then every once in

1515
00:53:47,050 --> 00:53:49,240
a while you get something as friggin

1516
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:52,360
awesome as spirited away hands-down one

1517
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:55,600
of my all-time favorite films this movie

1518
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,700
has the creativity of all the great

1519
00:53:57,700 --> 00:54:00,190
trippy fairy tales Alice in Wonderland

1520
00:54:00,190 --> 00:54:01,900
labyrinth The Nightmare Before Christmas

1521
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:04,540
so much of this really original stuff

1522
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:06,100
that you just don't see that much

1523
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:08,410
anymore I almost wonder if years later

1524
00:54:08,410 --> 00:54:09,910
they're gonna try and do a reboot of

1525
00:54:09,910 --> 00:54:12,100
this like a different interpretation the

1526
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:13,990
world is so open the creatures so

1527
00:54:13,990 --> 00:54:15,850
strange it actually would kind of be fun

1528
00:54:15,850 --> 00:54:16,870
to see an artist different

1529
00:54:16,870 --> 00:54:17,980
interpretation of it

1530
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:20,110
most people say you know something is a

1531
00:54:20,110 --> 00:54:22,030
masterpiece when you can't duplicate it

1532
00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:24,010
in a sense I kind of disagree

1533
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:25,780
people say books like Peter Pan or

1534
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:27,520
Christmas Carol are masterpieces but

1535
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:28,780
we're constantly seeing different

1536
00:54:28,780 --> 00:54:30,880
versions of it all the time so many new

1537
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,680
adaptations come out and I can see the

1538
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:34,480
same thing happened with this it's a

1539
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:35,950
world you're both delighted by and

1540
00:54:35,950 --> 00:54:38,350
horrified by at the same time you want

1541
00:54:38,350 --> 00:54:39,790
to live in it but you also kind of want

1542
00:54:39,790 --> 00:54:41,890
to run away from it in my opinion that's

1543
00:54:41,890 --> 00:54:43,900
the making of a great environment the

1544
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:45,400
stories about a little girl and her

1545
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:46,660
parents they're moving to a new

1546
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:48,280
neighborhood they come across what they

1547
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:50,170
think is an abandoned theme park but

1548
00:54:50,170 --> 00:54:52,480
really it's an enchanted bathhouse when

1549
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:54,340
the Sun Goes Down and the lights come on

1550
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:56,200
all sorts of various spirits come from

1551
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:58,630
around the world to relax here this

1552
00:54:58,630 --> 00:55:00,100
terrifies our main character as she

1553
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:01,540
finds out her parents have turned into

1554
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:03,370
pigs and she also lives in the world

1555
00:55:03,370 --> 00:55:05,740
that absolutely hates humans but luckily

1556
00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:07,540
she befriends a boy who can thankfully

1557
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:09,580
also turn into a dragon who decides he

1558
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:11,440
wants to help her he introduces her to

1559
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,150
the old lady who runs the place and

1560
00:55:13,150 --> 00:55:14,830
decides that she wants to stay alive

1561
00:55:14,830 --> 00:55:17,110
she'll have to get a job and the rest of

1562
00:55:17,110 --> 00:55:18,640
the film is heard just trying to survive

1563
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:20,620
in this bizarre place while also trying

1564
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:22,210
to make friends out of enemies who can

1565
00:55:22,210 --> 00:55:23,800
eventually help her get her parents back

1566
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:26,590
the girl in this movie named Zen is very

1567
00:55:26,590 --> 00:55:28,030
identifiable she

1568
00:55:28,030 --> 00:55:30,670
is terrified of everything but so are we

1569
00:55:30,670 --> 00:55:32,770
we don't know what this world is and it

1570
00:55:32,770 --> 00:55:33,880
is really creepy

1571
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:35,740
we see weird stuff happen like I said

1572
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:37,900
her parents turned into pigs there's

1573
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:39,880
monsters around every corner she has to

1574
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:41,410
sneak around or else they'll kill her

1575
00:55:41,410 --> 00:55:43,540
but at the same time you start to enjoy

1576
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:45,610
kind of the goofiness of it too there

1577
00:55:45,610 --> 00:55:47,400
are a lot of funny characters with

1578
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:50,080
unbelievable designs this whole movie is

1579
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:52,930
like a party house for imagination every

1580
00:55:52,930 --> 00:55:55,180
creature has their own unique look some

1581
00:55:55,180 --> 00:55:57,040
more human some more spider like some

1582
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:58,810
more lizard like and the majority of

1583
00:55:58,810 --> 00:56:00,400
them have very distinct and likeable

1584
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,380
personalities what I kind of like about

1585
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:04,480
though is unlike something like Kiki or

1586
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:06,790
my neighbor totoro they do put a little

1587
00:56:06,790 --> 00:56:08,950
bit more of a story to it there is still

1588
00:56:08,950 --> 00:56:10,690
goal that has to be accomplished by the

1589
00:56:10,690 --> 00:56:12,520
end of the film she has to escape and

1590
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:14,380
save her parents but it's how she goes

1591
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:15,850
through it that's the focus and what's

1592
00:56:15,850 --> 00:56:18,510
so entertaining she comes across so many

1593
00:56:18,510 --> 00:56:20,980
delightful people both delightful and

1594
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:22,630
how charming they are or delightful and

1595
00:56:22,630 --> 00:56:24,880
how terrible they are some are even kind

1596
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:26,380
of half in half and it's hard to get a

1597
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:28,480
grasp on them like most of Miyazaki's

1598
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:30,580
great work there is no one straight-up

1599
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:32,830
villain there's just kind of rude people

1600
00:56:32,830 --> 00:56:35,200
kind of crazy people kind of sane people

1601
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,360
it's just a wide variety the voice

1602
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:39,790
acting once again pitch perfect that's

1603
00:56:39,790 --> 00:56:41,530
the same actress who voice lilo doing

1604
00:56:41,530 --> 00:56:43,690
the voice of Zen main what a talent she

1605
00:56:43,690 --> 00:56:45,850
gets every emotion you need to feel in

1606
00:56:45,850 --> 00:56:48,310
every scene she is frantic she is whiny

1607
00:56:48,310 --> 00:56:50,170
and she is a complainer but it's never

1608
00:56:50,170 --> 00:56:52,000
to a point where she's annoying you

1609
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,860
totally understand what she's going

1610
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:55,450
through hell you would probably do half

1611
00:56:55,450 --> 00:56:57,370
of this stuff too there's also so many

1612
00:56:57,370 --> 00:56:59,290
great side stories going on about

1613
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:01,510
discovering people's past finding out

1614
00:57:01,510 --> 00:57:03,100
the flaws of these creatures and how

1615
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:04,870
they can be helped out but even in

1616
00:57:04,870 --> 00:57:06,520
between all of that there can still be

1617
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:08,770
moments of just relaxing and letting the

1618
00:57:08,770 --> 00:57:11,830
atmosphere sink in my god my favorite

1619
00:57:11,830 --> 00:57:13,270
scene is when they're on the train

1620
00:57:13,270 --> 00:57:15,010
nothing is happening here they're just

1621
00:57:15,010 --> 00:57:17,350
traveling and looking out the window but

1622
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:19,480
after all the craziness that's happened

1623
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:21,370
it's just the one place you want to be

1624
00:57:21,370 --> 00:57:23,620
there's no dialogue here there's no

1625
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:25,540
talking whatsoever it's just them

1626
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:27,430
looking out the window and you can feel

1627
00:57:27,430 --> 00:57:29,200
what they're going through this is the

1628
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:31,630
power of a visual medium not everything

1629
00:57:31,630 --> 00:57:33,940
has to be spelled out a scene can just

1630
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:35,320
play and you can take whatever you want

1631
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:37,030
from it because you know there's such

1632
00:57:37,030 --> 00:57:39,130
talented people behind it talented

1633
00:57:39,130 --> 00:57:40,810
people that can make you feel afraid

1634
00:57:40,810 --> 00:57:43,210
one scene but delighted in the next if I

1635
00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:45,880
really had to nitpick anything I mean

1636
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:48,940
friggin anything in this movie it's that

1637
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:51,160
the owner of the shop also has a twin

1638
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:53,860
sister they literally look exactly alike

1639
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:56,170
even down to what they wear and with all

1640
00:57:56,170 --> 00:57:58,030
this creativity and different people and

1641
00:57:58,030 --> 00:57:59,830
creations why didn't you make her look

1642
00:57:59,830 --> 00:58:00,460
different

1643
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:02,020
she doesn't have to be a twin sister I

1644
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,550
mean okay there's one scene where she

1645
00:58:03,550 --> 00:58:05,530
kind of fools then but it wasn't

1646
00:58:05,530 --> 00:58:07,360
necessary you've got have made her more

1647
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:09,340
beautiful or more ugly or just do

1648
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:11,470
something a little different but like I

1649
00:58:11,470 --> 00:58:13,540
said before that's really scraping the

1650
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:14,950
bottom of the barrel in terms of

1651
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:16,840
nitpicking I've said before this is a

1652
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:18,820
movie that's so good I'm actually kind

1653
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:21,400
of jealous of it I wish I could come up

1654
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:22,900
with something that's beautiful looking

1655
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:24,970
I wish I could create these incredible

1656
00:58:24,970 --> 00:58:26,470
locations I wish I could come up with

1657
00:58:26,470 --> 00:58:28,990
such funny ideas to get rid of curses

1658
00:58:28,990 --> 00:58:30,790
and stuff like that it's kind of like

1659
00:58:30,790 --> 00:58:32,890
the imagination of a brilliant child but

1660
00:58:32,890 --> 00:58:34,840
brought to life by trilliant adults

1661
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:36,700
these incredible animators and

1662
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:38,590
phenomenal storytellers that just keep

1663
00:58:38,590 --> 00:58:40,720
you sucked in through the simple needs

1664
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:42,700
of our main characters that anybody can

1665
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:44,770
identify with and can identify with very

1666
00:58:44,770 --> 00:58:46,780
quickly being scared of a new place

1667
00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:48,280
trying to figure out your identity

1668
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:50,200
having problems with family putting up

1669
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:51,790
with people you don't like all these

1670
00:58:51,790 --> 00:58:53,680
things they're so quick to pick up and

1671
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:55,300
it's all done in one of the most

1672
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:57,550
incredible environments ever put on

1673
00:58:57,550 --> 00:58:59,980
screen I love this movie from beginning

1674
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:02,740
to end it's just unbelievable the acting

1675
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:04,690
the writing the storytelling and above

1676
00:59:04,690 --> 00:59:06,970
all the unbelievable imagination

1677
00:59:06,970 --> 00:59:08,980
everyone's praised the hell out of this

1678
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:10,600
movie and I am one of the critics who's

1679
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:12,400
just gonna do the same but it's just

1680
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,590
that good I can't find that many things

1681
00:59:14,590 --> 00:59:16,600
wrong with it it's the exact kind of

1682
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:19,030
movie I would want to see at any age one

1683
00:59:19,030 --> 00:59:21,280
that just engulfs me in its world I

1684
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:22,720
don't even know what else to say about

1685
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:25,330
it's just amazing pop it in your DVD

1686
00:59:25,330 --> 00:59:29,250
player and experience it for yourself

1687
00:59:29,250 --> 00:59:39,880
[Music]

1688
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:41,830
[Music]

1689
00:59:41,830 --> 00:59:44,690
so remember that story whispers of the

1690
00:59:44,690 --> 00:59:46,430
heart that the girl was writing about

1691
00:59:46,430 --> 00:59:48,290
this cat baron who could go into these

1692
00:59:48,290 --> 00:59:50,360
magical lands and had these great powers

1693
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:52,460
well apparently the idea was so good

1694
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:53,840
that they decided to make a movie out of

1695
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:54,260
it

1696
00:59:54,260 --> 00:59:57,290
insert the cat returns a very confusing

1697
00:59:57,290 --> 00:59:59,180
title seeing how the cat isn't really

1698
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:00,650
returning he's meeting this character

1699
01:00:00,650 --> 01:00:02,420
for the first time but whatever the

1700
01:00:02,420 --> 01:00:04,070
character he meets as a girl named her

1701
01:00:04,070 --> 01:00:05,990
room she saves a cat from danger in the

1702
01:00:05,990 --> 01:00:07,400
middle of the road but it looks like

1703
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:09,740
that cat is a magical cat the prince of

1704
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:12,020
a kingdom to be exact a kingdom ruled by

1705
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:13,820
talking felines just like him

1706
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:15,830
touched by his rescue he has her Ruis

1707
01:00:15,830 --> 01:00:17,840
she would marry him she's so dumbfounded

1708
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:19,250
by what she's seen she doesn't know what

1709
01:00:19,250 --> 01:00:21,620
to say and he confuses it for a yes so

1710
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:23,270
the king of the cats played by Tim Curry

1711
01:00:23,270 --> 01:00:25,370
demands as she be brought to the kingdom

1712
01:00:25,370 --> 01:00:27,440
and turned into a cat herself her only

1713
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:29,690
salvation is a cat Baron played once

1714
01:00:29,690 --> 01:00:32,120
again by Cary Elwes who voiced the exact

1715
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:33,560
same character in whispers of the heart

1716
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:35,300
through all his magical antics and

1717
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:37,400
mysterious ways he finds a way to get

1718
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,170
her out of trouble as she gets back into

1719
01:00:39,170 --> 01:00:40,940
trouble and they constantly keep saving

1720
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:42,950
each other back and forth and it's a

1721
01:00:42,950 --> 01:00:44,390
race to get home as also it's a

1722
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:46,880
whimsical magic keeps taking place much

1723
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:48,980
enchanted scenery is discovered which of

1724
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:50,780
course leads to a lot of fun and some

1725
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:53,120
fantastic imagery it's play that they

1726
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:55,100
carry always to play this part because

1727
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:56,960
it actually does sort of have a Princess

1728
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:59,450
Bride feel to it not the story itself

1729
01:00:59,450 --> 01:01:01,910
but more kind of the feel it is kind of

1730
01:01:01,910 --> 01:01:04,160
funny and quirky but it's also kind of

1731
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:06,620
like a fairy tale with magical lands

1732
01:01:06,620 --> 01:01:09,020
flying talking animals it's a really

1733
01:01:09,020 --> 01:01:11,030
charming setup a young Anne Hathaway

1734
01:01:11,030 --> 01:01:12,800
plays Haru and she does a wonderful job

1735
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:14,780
actually playing it very similar to her

1736
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:16,640
Princess Diaries character which I stand

1737
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:18,290
by wouldn't be that bad a character she

1738
01:01:18,290 --> 01:01:20,750
was putting a better story this is that

1739
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:21,470
better story

1740
01:01:21,470 --> 01:01:23,390
she is klutzy and awkward but she's also

1741
01:01:23,390 --> 01:01:25,670
kind of wide-eyed innocent and just

1742
01:01:25,670 --> 01:01:27,260
trying to make sense of a world that has

1743
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:28,910
very little of it those of the voice

1744
01:01:28,910 --> 01:01:31,520
actors are great too Tim Curry puck you

1745
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:32,520
go wrong

1746
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:37,119
entertaining an officer whoever's next

1747
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:40,660
better not see Peter Boyle as the Barons

1748
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:41,440
sidekick

1749
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:43,780
but there is one casting choice that

1750
01:01:43,780 --> 01:01:46,450
just boggles the hell out of me I first

1751
01:01:46,450 --> 01:01:47,980
saw this in the original Japanese

1752
01:01:47,980 --> 01:01:49,570
language and one of my favorite

1753
01:01:49,570 --> 01:01:50,650
characters was this cute little

1754
01:01:50,650 --> 01:01:51,970
assistant cat

1755
01:01:51,970 --> 01:01:53,619
you just saw her and you just wanted to

1756
01:01:53,619 --> 01:01:55,690
pinch her cheek she was so cute and she

1757
01:01:55,690 --> 01:01:57,430
had this little smile on this friendly

1758
01:01:57,430 --> 01:01:59,410
little voice she was just adorable but

1759
01:01:59,410 --> 01:02:01,450
then when the American dub came who did

1760
01:02:01,450 --> 01:02:03,520
they get to voice her excuse me but I

1761
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:05,200
think there's a bit of a problem wait a

1762
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:08,109
minute is that Andy Richter why is Andy

1763
01:02:08,109 --> 01:02:10,330
Richter doing what is still obviously a

1764
01:02:10,330 --> 01:02:11,800
female design

1765
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:13,780
this isn't liking Kiki with Phil Hartman

1766
01:02:13,780 --> 01:02:15,940
where maybe it's male maybe it's female

1767
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:18,010
you can't quite tell by the design this

1768
01:02:18,010 --> 01:02:21,070
is so clearly female every time I see

1769
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:22,869
this character it's just so jarring to

1770
01:02:22,869 --> 01:02:24,820
instead not hear this cute little fluffy

1771
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:27,099
voice and instead Conan's co-host

1772
01:02:27,099 --> 01:02:29,140
emergency exit brawl guest right here

1773
01:02:29,140 --> 01:02:31,330
his name's and don't get me wrong he

1774
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:34,090
does fine it's just it's so clear this

1775
01:02:34,090 --> 01:02:35,740
isn't the right voice that should go

1776
01:02:35,740 --> 01:02:37,480
with this character it's kinda like

1777
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:39,010
keeping the voice of the Little Mermaid

1778
01:02:39,010 --> 01:02:41,320
to a male baritone singer it just

1779
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:42,310
doesn't add up

1780
01:02:42,310 --> 01:02:44,260
however the rest of the film is just a

1781
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:46,390
pure delight it's not anything on an

1782
01:02:46,390 --> 01:02:49,270
epic scale like say Mononoke or Nausicaa

1783
01:02:49,270 --> 01:02:51,040
it's more like what the girl was riding

1784
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:52,599
in whispers of the heart Oh cute little

1785
01:02:52,599 --> 01:02:54,580
fairy tale but it's cute little fairy

1786
01:02:54,580 --> 01:02:57,040
tales go it's very well done it's funny

1787
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:58,839
it's imaginative it's clever

1788
01:02:58,839 --> 01:03:01,119
it has enjoyable characters and a lot of

1789
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:03,310
wonderful visuals but hey why listen to

1790
01:03:03,310 --> 01:03:05,380
me talk about anymore see for yourself

1791
01:03:05,380 --> 01:03:06,140
and get whisked away

1792
01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:12,890
[Music]

1793
01:03:12,890 --> 01:03:21,769
[Music]

1794
01:03:21,769 --> 01:03:24,390
if you see my nostalgic rave review of

1795
01:03:24,390 --> 01:03:26,279
pono you might remember a very

1796
01:03:26,279 --> 01:03:29,069
particular ending its Miyazaki it has

1797
01:03:29,069 --> 01:03:31,769
its own charm and it's just a lot of fun

1798
01:03:31,769 --> 01:03:36,679
not like that movie Howl's Moving Castle

1799
01:03:36,679 --> 01:03:39,359
since then so many people have asked me

1800
01:03:39,359 --> 01:03:41,909
why do I hate Howl's Moving Castle and

1801
01:03:41,909 --> 01:03:43,949
the first clarification is I don't hate

1802
01:03:43,949 --> 01:03:46,169
it I just don't think it's very good and

1803
01:03:46,169 --> 01:03:48,509
even by that I kind of mean by Miyazaki

1804
01:03:48,509 --> 01:03:50,519
standards it is still visually

1805
01:03:50,519 --> 01:03:52,199
interesting and has a lot of imagination

1806
01:03:52,199 --> 01:03:53,999
and it even has a fair amount of good

1807
01:03:53,999 --> 01:03:56,759
character what it doesn't have is focus

1808
01:03:56,759 --> 01:03:59,669
this movie is all over the place and

1809
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:01,589
sure I'm not gonna act like story was

1810
01:04:01,589 --> 01:04:03,539
always the biggest part of a Miyazaki

1811
01:04:03,539 --> 01:04:05,339
film it was much more about environment

1812
01:04:05,339 --> 01:04:07,079
and characters and so on but there was

1813
01:04:07,079 --> 01:04:09,179
still enough of a simplicity to his work

1814
01:04:09,179 --> 01:04:11,309
that made it really come out as charming

1815
01:04:11,309 --> 01:04:14,099
this one just throws so much at you it's

1816
01:04:14,099 --> 01:04:16,769
hard to remember even what happened howl

1817
01:04:16,769 --> 01:04:18,419
in the movie is a wizard played by

1818
01:04:18,419 --> 01:04:20,339
Christian Bale he comes across a header

1819
01:04:20,339 --> 01:04:22,199
named Sophie who then comes across a

1820
01:04:22,199 --> 01:04:23,789
mean lady known as the Witch of the

1821
01:04:23,789 --> 01:04:25,829
waste it appears this witch is in love

1822
01:04:25,829 --> 01:04:27,569
with howl so much so that when Sophie

1823
01:04:27,569 --> 01:04:29,759
refuses to serve her she puts a terrible

1824
01:04:29,759 --> 01:04:31,829
curse on her transforming her eighteen

1825
01:04:31,829 --> 01:04:33,749
year old body into that of a 90 year old

1826
01:04:33,749 --> 01:04:35,880
woman determined to get the curse lifted

1827
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:37,829
she sets out trying to find howl and

1828
01:04:37,829 --> 01:04:39,929
comes across what else is moving castle

1829
01:04:39,929 --> 01:04:41,789
well there she comes across some

1830
01:04:41,789 --> 01:04:43,859
colorful characters a scarecrow known as

1831
01:04:43,859 --> 01:04:45,630
turnip head Howl's apprentice named

1832
01:04:45,630 --> 01:04:48,029
Markel and a talking ball of fire voiced

1833
01:04:48,029 --> 01:04:50,130
by Billy Crystal she decides to appoint

1834
01:04:50,130 --> 01:04:51,809
herself the cleaning woman of the castle

1835
01:04:51,809 --> 01:04:53,699
because she sees it as such a mess the

1836
01:04:53,699 --> 01:04:55,529
bad news is it doesn't seem like he can

1837
01:04:55,529 --> 01:04:56,130
lift the curse

1838
01:04:56,130 --> 01:04:58,199
that's not especially on his mind anyway

1839
01:04:58,199 --> 01:05:00,179
as there's two warring countries and one

1840
01:05:00,179 --> 01:05:01,979
of them wants how to use his magic to

1841
01:05:01,979 --> 01:05:03,329
help them win their fight

1842
01:05:03,329 --> 01:05:05,279
owl goes back and forth between agreeing

1843
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:07,199
to do it and not all while Sophie comes

1844
01:05:07,199 --> 01:05:09,089
across the evil witch who seems to be

1845
01:05:09,089 --> 01:05:10,979
losing her power and thus the curse

1846
01:05:10,979 --> 01:05:13,409
seems to be going away but only a little

1847
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:15,779
and actually it's kind of inconsistent

1848
01:05:15,779 --> 01:05:17,849
sometimes she's older sometimes she's

1849
01:05:17,849 --> 01:05:19,829
younger I'm sure there's a reason why

1850
01:05:19,829 --> 01:05:22,499
but honestly this film goes all over the

1851
01:05:22,499 --> 01:05:24,539
place and tries to throw so much at you

1852
01:05:24,539 --> 01:05:26,589
that I guess it got lost in

1853
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:28,749
me as a lot of this movie did I'm

1854
01:05:28,749 --> 01:05:30,219
constantly trying to remember what

1855
01:05:30,219 --> 01:05:32,410
exactly was I watched him what happened

1856
01:05:32,410 --> 01:05:34,660
in what order and what they meant and

1857
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:37,569
where we were and it's just always doing

1858
01:05:37,569 --> 01:05:39,219
something I try to figure out why the

1859
01:05:39,219 --> 01:05:41,079
scatterbrain of a movie did so little

1860
01:05:41,079 --> 01:05:42,880
for me when something like spirited away

1861
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:45,219
which you could argue also does a lot of

1862
01:05:45,219 --> 01:05:46,719
strange stuff and throws a lot at you

1863
01:05:46,719 --> 01:05:48,759
did so much the only thing I can figure

1864
01:05:48,759 --> 01:05:51,430
is movies like spirited away or Kiki or

1865
01:05:51,430 --> 01:05:53,799
Nausicaa is that they're fueled by very

1866
01:05:53,799 --> 01:05:56,380
simple desires sin just wants to save

1867
01:05:56,380 --> 01:05:58,390
her parents and leave Kiki wants to be

1868
01:05:58,390 --> 01:06:00,460
an accomplished adult Nausicaa just

1869
01:06:00,460 --> 01:06:02,259
wants to save her people here

1870
01:06:02,259 --> 01:06:04,749
I forget what Howells motivation is and

1871
01:06:04,749 --> 01:06:07,119
yeah I know Sophie wants to get the

1872
01:06:07,119 --> 01:06:09,339
curse lifted but even that's or it seems

1873
01:06:09,339 --> 01:06:10,509
like something that's put on the

1874
01:06:10,509 --> 01:06:12,519
backburner half the time with the other

1875
01:06:12,519 --> 01:06:14,559
films the ideas were motivating the

1876
01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:16,960
visuals here it feels like the visuals

1877
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:19,420
are motivating the ideas I remember

1878
01:06:19,420 --> 01:06:21,190
there's a particularly strange scene

1879
01:06:21,190 --> 01:06:23,619
where Sophie and the witch are so slowly

1880
01:06:23,619 --> 01:06:25,900
going up these stairs and it's

1881
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:28,150
uncomfortable and it's odd and it's not

1882
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:30,009
pleasant to look at I remember asking

1883
01:06:30,009 --> 01:06:32,710
myself why am I even watching this how

1884
01:06:32,710 --> 01:06:34,749
is this enjoyable or dramatic or

1885
01:06:34,749 --> 01:06:37,150
creative it's just weird and unpleasant

1886
01:06:37,150 --> 01:06:39,069
that's not to say there aren't some good

1887
01:06:39,069 --> 01:06:41,259
moments the visuals for example are

1888
01:06:41,259 --> 01:06:43,390
great there's a really nice scene at the

1889
01:06:43,390 --> 01:06:45,759
end where she time travels for some

1890
01:06:45,759 --> 01:06:47,589
reason or other again it's really

1891
01:06:47,589 --> 01:06:49,269
complicated and hard to follow and it

1892
01:06:49,269 --> 01:06:51,430
creates almost kind of a dreamlike scene

1893
01:06:51,430 --> 01:06:53,440
I don't know it's hard to explain but

1894
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:55,210
the colors and the atmosphere and the

1895
01:06:55,210 --> 01:06:57,279
mood it's the only time it felt like I

1896
01:06:57,279 --> 01:06:59,349
was genuinely watching a Miyazaki film

1897
01:06:59,349 --> 01:07:01,299
at least in terms of what it made me

1898
01:07:01,299 --> 01:07:03,190
feel the rest of the movie definitely

1899
01:07:03,190 --> 01:07:05,769
looks like a Miyazaki film and even has

1900
01:07:05,769 --> 01:07:07,749
some thoughts I can be izaki film but I

1901
01:07:07,749 --> 01:07:09,670
just didn't feel the same magic as other

1902
01:07:09,670 --> 01:07:12,279
Miyazaki films like I said I don't think

1903
01:07:12,279 --> 01:07:14,049
it's all fallen even people who asked me

1904
01:07:14,049 --> 01:07:16,089
why I didn't like the film kind of nod

1905
01:07:16,089 --> 01:07:18,249
and understand when I explain it even

1906
01:07:18,249 --> 01:07:20,140
the most die-hard Miyazaki fans don't

1907
01:07:20,140 --> 01:07:22,059
usually consider this one of his best

1908
01:07:22,059 --> 01:07:24,099
works it's still impressive and it's

1909
01:07:24,099 --> 01:07:25,900
animated great he'll even the voice

1910
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:27,969
acting is still pretty well done but

1911
01:07:27,969 --> 01:07:29,499
it's not really one I look forward to

1912
01:07:29,499 --> 01:07:31,420
watching again when I had to do Disney

1913
01:07:31,420 --> 01:07:33,489
cember it has a nice artwork here and

1914
01:07:33,489 --> 01:07:35,019
there but for the most part it's just

1915
01:07:35,019 --> 01:07:37,059
kind of confusing and dull which is such

1916
01:07:37,059 --> 01:07:38,380
an odd thing to say

1917
01:07:38,380 --> 01:07:40,720
so much bizarre imagery but if you don't

1918
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:42,670
care behind what's motivating it why

1919
01:07:42,670 --> 01:07:44,440
should I care to watch it to the end I

1920
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:47,080
don't know if you enjoy it I understand

1921
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:48,790
I'm not gonna act like there's nothing

1922
01:07:48,790 --> 01:07:50,770
to have fun with in this movie but for

1923
01:07:50,770 --> 01:07:53,200
me it's probably the only Miyazaki film

1924
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:55,060
where the lack of focus actually got in

1925
01:07:55,060 --> 01:07:56,740
the way of it being a good product I

1926
01:07:56,740 --> 01:07:58,750
know I'm kind of a minority on that but

1927
01:07:58,750 --> 01:08:00,610
I'm not gonna lie I'm not gonna say I

1928
01:08:00,610 --> 01:08:02,410
like something when I legitimately don't

1929
01:08:02,410 --> 01:08:04,240
but I'm not gonna act like it's anything

1930
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:05,950
terrible either how much rather watch

1931
01:08:05,950 --> 01:08:08,080
the worse of Miyazaki than the best of

1932
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:09,880
Michael Bay any day and I don't really

1933
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:11,680
see this film as a waste of time there's

1934
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:13,570
still some cool stuff to see but in

1935
01:08:13,570 --> 01:08:15,100
terms of getting some really emotional

1936
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:16,690
magical moments

1937
01:08:16,690 --> 01:08:18,250
I'd say it's other work is more worth

1938
01:08:18,250 --> 01:08:20,260
checking out I know a lot of people like

1939
01:08:20,260 --> 01:08:21,439
it it's just not for me

1940
01:08:21,439 --> 01:08:36,029
[Music]

1941
01:08:36,029 --> 01:08:38,130
[Music]

1942
01:08:38,130 --> 01:08:40,540
tales from Earthsea is based on the

1943
01:08:40,540 --> 01:08:42,460
series of novels that sadly I hadn't

1944
01:08:42,460 --> 01:08:44,260
read but based on the majority of the

1945
01:08:44,260 --> 01:08:46,210
film I've seen here I just may need to

1946
01:08:46,210 --> 01:08:48,070
it starts off with a ship of people that

1947
01:08:48,070 --> 01:08:49,300
look up and see a bunch of dragons

1948
01:08:49,300 --> 01:08:51,640
wrestling okay a strong start but this

1949
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:52,990
news makes it back to the king of the

1950
01:08:52,990 --> 01:08:54,820
land saying that dragons never fight

1951
01:08:54,820 --> 01:08:56,770
that this is a horrible omen they talk

1952
01:08:56,770 --> 01:08:58,330
about how a lot of strange has been

1953
01:08:58,330 --> 01:08:59,800
going on like how Wizards have been

1954
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:01,540
losing their power balance is being

1955
01:09:01,540 --> 01:09:03,520
thrown all over the place something bad

1956
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:05,140
is coming something terrible and just

1957
01:09:05,140 --> 01:09:06,910
before they start to proceed forward to

1958
01:09:06,910 --> 01:09:08,200
figure out what to do about it

1959
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:09,910
the king who seems like a pretty cool

1960
01:09:09,910 --> 01:09:12,130
nice character is killed I thought this

1961
01:09:12,130 --> 01:09:13,510
guy was gonna be the main character he

1962
01:09:13,510 --> 01:09:15,700
seems so nice and strong-willed but no

1963
01:09:15,700 --> 01:09:17,440
the kid that stabbed him is the main

1964
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:19,360
character and on top of that he's the

1965
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:22,000
son of this guy he steals the sword runs

1966
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,710
away from the palace and the opening

1967
01:09:23,710 --> 01:09:26,890
credits roll holy that's the way to

1968
01:09:26,890 --> 01:09:29,620
start a story a million questions were

1969
01:09:29,620 --> 01:09:31,420
racing through my mind how is this the

1970
01:09:31,420 --> 01:09:32,710
main character what possessed him to

1971
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:34,090
kill his father his father seemed pretty

1972
01:09:34,090 --> 01:09:34,630
cool

1973
01:09:34,630 --> 01:09:36,400
why are dragons fighting why is it bad

1974
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:37,990
that they fight is that what dragons do

1975
01:09:37,990 --> 01:09:39,310
what place do they have in this

1976
01:09:39,310 --> 01:09:40,930
environment why is the Sun suddenly

1977
01:09:40,930 --> 01:09:42,760
normal now he seems afraid of these

1978
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:44,470
wolves and like really creeped out

1979
01:09:44,470 --> 01:09:46,210
wasn't this the cycle that just killed

1980
01:09:46,210 --> 01:09:48,610
his dad a moment ago just oh my god it's

1981
01:09:48,610 --> 01:09:50,590
just racing through my head everyone

1982
01:09:50,590 --> 01:09:52,120
thinks you have to start off these epic

1983
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:54,160
fantasies with these big battles or

1984
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:55,990
explosions or something but in reality

1985
01:09:55,990 --> 01:09:58,180
all the great fantasy start off as

1986
01:09:58,180 --> 01:10:00,430
little stories they do this so you can

1987
01:10:00,430 --> 01:10:01,960
connect with the main character who's

1988
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:03,940
usually somebody who's kind of timid

1989
01:10:03,940 --> 01:10:05,770
kind of afraid about to go on this big

1990
01:10:05,770 --> 01:10:07,660
adventure and that's exactly what this

1991
01:10:07,660 --> 01:10:09,550
movie does we get to know our main

1992
01:10:09,550 --> 01:10:10,900
character who is the prince

1993
01:10:10,900 --> 01:10:12,520
who's on the run from his heinous crime

1994
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:14,080
and comes across a wizard played by

1995
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:16,060
Timothy Dalton I'm convinced this guy is

1996
01:10:16,060 --> 01:10:18,070
Liam Neeson's monotone if it was made

1997
01:10:18,070 --> 01:10:19,990
more interesting just based on his

1998
01:10:19,990 --> 01:10:21,670
performance I would follow this guy

1999
01:10:21,670 --> 01:10:23,980
anywhere he's Stern and strict but he

2000
01:10:23,980 --> 01:10:25,420
definitely sounds like he knows what

2001
01:10:25,420 --> 01:10:27,040
he's talking about it doesn't sound like

2002
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:29,050
a guy who's trying to sound bad as he

2003
01:10:29,050 --> 01:10:31,660
sounds legitimately badass along the way

2004
01:10:31,660 --> 01:10:33,220
they come across a girl with a burn mark

2005
01:10:33,220 --> 01:10:35,560
on her face she seems beyond socially

2006
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:37,150
awkward and naturally the prince in her

2007
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:39,070
don't get along but it also turns out

2008
01:10:39,070 --> 01:10:40,540
she's been adopted by this woman who's a

2009
01:10:40,540 --> 01:10:42,880
friend of the wizard or mage is there a

2010
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:43,840
difference I don't know

2011
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:45,849
gets a call mage slowly but surely they

2012
01:10:45,849 --> 01:10:47,530
start to open up and of course they find

2013
01:10:47,530 --> 01:10:49,119
out they have a lot in common and start

2014
01:10:49,119 --> 01:10:50,500
a nice relationship together but

2015
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:52,659
troubles of ruin when another evil mage

2016
01:10:52,659 --> 01:10:55,179
named Cobb played by Willem Dafoe is one

2017
01:10:55,179 --> 01:10:56,650
of the few wizards who hasn't lost his

2018
01:10:56,650 --> 01:10:57,280
magic

2019
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:59,139
thus he plans to use the imbalance

2020
01:10:59,139 --> 01:11:00,699
that's going on in the world to somehow

2021
01:11:00,699 --> 01:11:03,099
achieve eternal life and the mage seems

2022
01:11:03,099 --> 01:11:05,260
to be the ticket how along the way we

2023
01:11:05,260 --> 01:11:07,599
discover secrets magical powers and the

2024
01:11:07,599 --> 01:11:09,099
truth about what people's spirits as

2025
01:11:09,099 --> 01:11:10,300
well as their physical bodies are

2026
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:12,880
capable of for the first two-thirds of

2027
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:15,389
this movie I was absolutely in love

2028
01:11:15,389 --> 01:11:17,500
everyone always said this film was just

2029
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:18,880
okay but I didn't know what they were

2030
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:21,070
talking about I was sucked in I was

2031
01:11:21,070 --> 01:11:22,449
sucked in because I knew this was a

2032
01:11:22,449 --> 01:11:24,610
smaller story that was taking place in a

2033
01:11:24,610 --> 01:11:26,440
grander battle they kept talking about

2034
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:28,360
how something big was coming some sort

2035
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:30,130
of big change and there's just this

2036
01:11:30,130 --> 01:11:31,599
feeling of dread throughout the whole

2037
01:11:31,599 --> 01:11:33,340
thing it's kinda like in Game of Thrones

2038
01:11:33,340 --> 01:11:34,810
how when you get down to it there really

2039
01:11:34,810 --> 01:11:37,210
aren't that many big battles in it but

2040
01:11:37,210 --> 01:11:38,230
it's all about the bill up and

2041
01:11:38,230 --> 01:11:40,030
establishing the character well there's

2042
01:11:40,030 --> 01:11:42,040
not quite as much talk of strategy in

2043
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:43,659
this there certainly is a feeling of a

2044
01:11:43,659 --> 01:11:46,510
lot of impending doom Cobb for example

2045
01:11:46,510 --> 01:11:49,270
is one of the creepiest villains Willem

2046
01:11:49,270 --> 01:11:50,739
Dafoe throughout almost the entire

2047
01:11:50,739 --> 01:11:52,900
performance does nothing but whisper his

2048
01:11:52,900 --> 01:11:55,719
lines and it is just unsettling his

2049
01:11:55,719 --> 01:11:57,730
voice is like a spider crawling its way

2050
01:11:57,730 --> 01:11:59,409
into your ear it's just so uncomfortable

2051
01:11:59,409 --> 01:12:01,960
whenever he speaks he's so hard to

2052
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:03,880
figure out - I mean you know he's a bad

2053
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:05,739
guy but always has this confident smile

2054
01:12:05,739 --> 01:12:07,389
on his face you know he can do these

2055
01:12:07,389 --> 01:12:09,280
terrible big things but he's also very

2056
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:12,159
frail and moves very little you have no

2057
01:12:12,159 --> 01:12:13,840
idea what this guy is up to but you know

2058
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:16,090
he has everything figured out and that's

2059
01:12:16,090 --> 01:12:17,409
one of the creepiest things about a

2060
01:12:17,409 --> 01:12:19,420
villain one that just has no fear

2061
01:12:19,420 --> 01:12:21,730
whatsoever so like I said watching this

2062
01:12:21,730 --> 01:12:22,090
film

2063
01:12:22,090 --> 01:12:24,099
I was just engrossed where was this all

2064
01:12:24,099 --> 01:12:26,170
going what's it building up to what's

2065
01:12:26,170 --> 01:12:27,849
the bigger grander picture that they're

2066
01:12:27,849 --> 01:12:29,860
finally gonna deliver but then when we

2067
01:12:29,860 --> 01:12:31,869
get to the third act I was really

2068
01:12:31,869 --> 01:12:34,389
disappointed instead of a big battle or

2069
01:12:34,389 --> 01:12:36,310
getting a bunch of answers or getting an

2070
01:12:36,310 --> 01:12:38,260
army together or just something that

2071
01:12:38,260 --> 01:12:41,020
seems larger it's just a small fight in

2072
01:12:41,020 --> 01:12:42,849
a castle with the hero wielding his

2073
01:12:42,849 --> 01:12:45,310
sword a few magic spells throne and just

2074
01:12:45,310 --> 01:12:46,989
fighting a great big monster while

2075
01:12:46,989 --> 01:12:49,139
trying to save the damsel in distress oh

2076
01:12:49,139 --> 01:12:51,929
man what a let

2077
01:12:51,929 --> 01:12:53,969
for a film that opens up with dragons

2078
01:12:53,969 --> 01:12:56,099
wrestling in so much dread and people

2079
01:12:56,099 --> 01:12:57,630
saying there's this great imbalance and

2080
01:12:57,630 --> 01:12:59,429
something terrible is coming this is

2081
01:12:59,429 --> 01:13:01,590
that terribleness that was coming I

2082
01:13:01,590 --> 01:13:03,329
totally accept the possibility that

2083
01:13:03,329 --> 01:13:05,460
maybe this is just the first part of the

2084
01:13:05,460 --> 01:13:07,530
story like maybe this is the Fellowship

2085
01:13:07,530 --> 01:13:09,269
of the Ring part and there's going to be

2086
01:13:09,269 --> 01:13:11,519
more to it but even in fellowship they

2087
01:13:11,519 --> 01:13:13,139
knew how to make a bigger deal of their

2088
01:13:13,139 --> 01:13:15,389
climax how to make you feel that this is

2089
01:13:15,389 --> 01:13:16,860
important stuff you're watching

2090
01:13:16,860 --> 01:13:18,599
ironically the problem I always have

2091
01:13:18,599 --> 01:13:20,070
with fellowship is that you never felt

2092
01:13:20,070 --> 01:13:22,289
the simpler side of it the normal quiet

2093
01:13:22,289 --> 01:13:23,820
life of our main character that's going

2094
01:13:23,820 --> 01:13:25,530
to be interrupted everything in

2095
01:13:25,530 --> 01:13:27,269
fellowship was big and huge even the

2096
01:13:27,269 --> 01:13:29,250
party they through this movie has the

2097
01:13:29,250 --> 01:13:31,230
exact opposite problem the simpler stuff

2098
01:13:31,230 --> 01:13:33,780
is there and is very well done and it

2099
01:13:33,780 --> 01:13:35,760
has some phenomenal build up for what

2100
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:37,860
they could possibly deliver but in this

2101
01:13:37,860 --> 01:13:39,929
movie it never is delivered even the

2102
01:13:39,929 --> 01:13:41,730
ending kind of looks like they're done

2103
01:13:41,730 --> 01:13:44,159
and wrapping up speaking of which I

2104
01:13:44,159 --> 01:13:45,960
don't understand the ending at all

2105
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:48,000
without giving away too much detail

2106
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,469
there's another interaction with a

2107
01:13:49,469 --> 01:13:53,159
dragon kinda-sorta and I just don't get

2108
01:13:53,159 --> 01:13:53,579
it

2109
01:13:53,579 --> 01:13:55,170
it didn't seem like something that was

2110
01:13:55,170 --> 01:13:56,730
meant to be abstract or open to

2111
01:13:56,730 --> 01:13:59,369
interpretation it seemed to be like yeah

2112
01:13:59,369 --> 01:14:00,840
you're supposed to know what this is

2113
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:02,820
you're supposed to know what's going on

2114
01:14:02,820 --> 01:14:04,650
and why it's going on the film is

2115
01:14:04,650 --> 01:14:06,570
directed not by Hayao Miyazaki but by

2116
01:14:06,570 --> 01:14:09,059
his son Goro and for a first film it's

2117
01:14:09,059 --> 01:14:11,789
really impressive like I said I love the

2118
01:14:11,789 --> 01:14:13,920
first two-thirds of this movie I don't

2119
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:15,269
think I've ever been so hyped to see

2120
01:14:15,269 --> 01:14:17,969
where a fantasy film was going I really

2121
01:14:17,969 --> 01:14:19,619
thought this was gonna be like a Narnia

2122
01:14:19,619 --> 01:14:21,360
something that starts off so simple and

2123
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:23,250
basic but turns into this grand epic

2124
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:25,679
battle instead it feels more like the

2125
01:14:25,679 --> 01:14:28,440
last level in a Selda game even Willem

2126
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:30,179
Dafoe seems to go from that terrifying

2127
01:14:30,179 --> 01:14:31,590
voice to something that seemed more

2128
01:14:31,590 --> 01:14:33,900
Green Goblin ish but still does that

2129
01:14:33,900 --> 01:14:35,489
mean I should dislike the entire movie

2130
01:14:35,489 --> 01:14:37,679
for that I don't think so I still love

2131
01:14:37,679 --> 01:14:39,719
the majority of this film if they ever

2132
01:14:39,719 --> 01:14:41,699
did make a sequel to it I probably watch

2133
01:14:41,699 --> 01:14:43,619
it in the hopes that actually does go

2134
01:14:43,619 --> 01:14:45,780
somewhere bigger like I said I even read

2135
01:14:45,780 --> 01:14:47,969
the books I have no idea how close it is

2136
01:14:47,969 --> 01:14:50,460
or far it is to it but for what it is I

2137
01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:52,769
really enjoy the journey I just didn't

2138
01:14:52,769 --> 01:14:54,809
enjoy where it ended up I'll emphasize

2139
01:14:54,809 --> 01:14:56,429
right now though that I'm one of those

2140
01:14:56,429 --> 01:14:58,230
people that just likes these kind of

2141
01:14:58,230 --> 01:14:59,969
stories the stories that start off small

2142
01:14:59,969 --> 01:15:01,559
and get bigger and bigger and bigger

2143
01:15:01,559 --> 01:15:02,700
for example I'm

2144
01:15:02,700 --> 01:15:04,320
of the few people that actually like the

2145
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:06,240
first Hobbit I kind of felt like it was

2146
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:07,650
the Fellowship of the Ring I never got

2147
01:15:07,650 --> 01:15:09,600
so I don't think this is a fantasy

2148
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:11,760
that's going to engulf everybody hell

2149
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:14,520
most people say it's okay at best but

2150
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:16,230
personally I could get lost in this

2151
01:15:16,230 --> 01:15:18,240
world and its environment and watch

2152
01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:20,430
these characters all day yeah I know

2153
01:15:20,430 --> 01:15:21,720
this review is kind of all over the

2154
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:23,430
place but hopefully you can get an idea

2155
01:15:23,430 --> 01:15:24,660
if this is something you'd be interested

2156
01:15:24,660 --> 01:15:26,760
in take your chances and see what you

2157
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:27,400
discover

2158
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:34,130
[Music]

2159
01:15:34,130 --> 01:15:41,460
Oh

2160
01:15:41,460 --> 01:15:44,010
[Music]

2161
01:15:44,010 --> 01:15:46,180
it's almost kind of pointless to talk

2162
01:15:46,180 --> 01:15:47,440
about Pony Oh seeing how I've done a

2163
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:49,090
whole entire nostalgic rate review

2164
01:15:49,090 --> 01:15:51,040
dedicated to it but let's take a quick

2165
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:52,960
look anyway because this time we won't

2166
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:54,400
have any jokes or anything just a

2167
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:56,260
straightforward honest opinion the film

2168
01:15:56,260 --> 01:15:58,480
is very loosely based on the Little

2169
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:00,490
Mermaid and when I say very loosely I

2170
01:16:00,490 --> 01:16:02,830
mean there's practically no reason to

2171
01:16:02,830 --> 01:16:04,450
connect it to the Little Mermaid it's a

2172
01:16:04,450 --> 01:16:06,250
female half-human half-fish that comes

2173
01:16:06,250 --> 01:16:07,930
out of the water befriends a male and

2174
01:16:07,930 --> 01:16:10,120
that's about it everything else is

2175
01:16:10,120 --> 01:16:13,210
completely 100% different it has less to

2176
01:16:13,210 --> 01:16:15,670
do with the lore I made then the Little

2177
01:16:15,670 --> 01:16:18,190
Mermaid Pony o is an enchanted fish who

2178
01:16:18,190 --> 01:16:20,440
comes from a magical man named Fujimoto

2179
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:22,360
played by Liam Neeson one day she

2180
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:24,010
decides to go exploring and comes across

2181
01:16:24,010 --> 01:16:26,470
a boy playing in the sea as she becomes

2182
01:16:26,470 --> 01:16:28,390
more and more human the boy in her start

2183
01:16:28,390 --> 01:16:30,370
to form a very strong relationship the

2184
01:16:30,370 --> 01:16:32,110
longer she stays human and out of the

2185
01:16:32,110 --> 01:16:33,820
sea the more it seems to throw the world

2186
01:16:33,820 --> 01:16:36,220
out of whack and I mean really out of

2187
01:16:36,220 --> 01:16:38,380
whack towns are suddenly put underwater

2188
01:16:38,380 --> 01:16:40,060
the moon is about to crash into the

2189
01:16:40,060 --> 01:16:42,400
earth it suddenly gets totally insane

2190
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:44,620
but you almost 1 notice is seeing how

2191
01:16:44,620 --> 01:16:46,870
totally calm and relaxed everybody seems

2192
01:16:46,870 --> 01:16:49,150
to be no so their houses are underwater

2193
01:16:49,150 --> 01:16:51,460
big deal you know what it's good day for

2194
01:16:51,460 --> 01:16:54,250
a picnic let's row our boats go fishing

2195
01:16:54,250 --> 01:16:56,110
just totally have fun on this otherwise

2196
01:16:56,110 --> 01:16:57,700
beautiful day yeah

2197
01:16:57,700 --> 01:17:00,280
it's that kind of movie Kenpo neo get

2198
01:17:00,280 --> 01:17:01,780
back in time in order to set everything

2199
01:17:01,780 --> 01:17:02,470
right

2200
01:17:02,470 --> 01:17:04,480
well again being that kind of movie you

2201
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:06,400
can probably guess what the outcomes

2202
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:09,040
gonna be weird and that's definitely a

2203
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:11,890
word to describe this movie weird it's

2204
01:17:11,890 --> 01:17:14,530
still charming and really likable but it

2205
01:17:14,530 --> 01:17:18,820
is weird if I think about is that even

2206
01:17:18,820 --> 01:17:20,650
though there is a lot of surreal imagery

2207
01:17:20,650 --> 01:17:22,540
that's not what's so strange about it

2208
01:17:22,540 --> 01:17:25,060
the strangeness really does just lie in

2209
01:17:25,060 --> 01:17:27,790
the story you couldn't predict the

2210
01:17:27,790 --> 01:17:29,920
reactions or the choices that these

2211
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:31,990
characters make or the outcomes that

2212
01:17:31,990 --> 01:17:34,210
they produce on the one hand it's just

2213
01:17:34,210 --> 01:17:37,270
so strange to get a grasp on I mean it

2214
01:17:37,270 --> 01:17:39,400
seems like this is a tiny little story

2215
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:41,920
about a girl befriending a boy and also

2216
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:43,840
it's a little magic but then here talks

2217
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:45,790
about the moon is gonna destroy the

2218
01:17:45,790 --> 01:17:47,100
world and it's like where

2219
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:49,020
this come from but on the other hand

2220
01:17:49,020 --> 01:17:51,060
that's also what's kind of charmingly

2221
01:17:51,060 --> 01:17:53,640
strange about it it's basically in its

2222
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:56,310
own strain setup where even if the world

2223
01:17:56,310 --> 01:17:58,590
seems to be under water it's kind of

2224
01:17:58,590 --> 01:18:00,870
okay something about that optimism is

2225
01:18:00,870 --> 01:18:03,660
very bizarrely likable the unexplainable

2226
01:18:03,660 --> 01:18:06,060
to say the least but still likable and I

2227
01:18:06,060 --> 01:18:07,650
think a lot just comes from its

2228
01:18:07,650 --> 01:18:10,140
simplicity all this chaos is constantly

2229
01:18:10,140 --> 01:18:11,850
going around these characters and yet

2230
01:18:11,850 --> 01:18:13,890
the biggest concern for our main lead is

2231
01:18:13,890 --> 01:18:16,380
to get ham yeah she discovers what ham

2232
01:18:16,380 --> 01:18:18,690
is and is totally obsessed with it how

2233
01:18:18,690 --> 01:18:21,870
can you not like a film so weird even

2234
01:18:21,870 --> 01:18:23,490
the art style seems a lot simpler

2235
01:18:23,490 --> 01:18:25,770
compared to other miyazaki movies but I

2236
01:18:25,770 --> 01:18:27,510
don't mean that any way to insult it I

2237
01:18:27,510 --> 01:18:29,670
think that's just the style it's drawn

2238
01:18:29,670 --> 01:18:31,320
much more like a kid's blog and it's

2239
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:34,140
kind of told in that way too well for

2240
01:18:34,140 --> 01:18:36,570
the most part again the complications of

2241
01:18:36,570 --> 01:18:39,060
the plot are really I don't know I don't

2242
01:18:39,060 --> 01:18:41,970
want to say lazy but not really needed

2243
01:18:41,970 --> 01:18:44,430
but then again maybe that's the point of

2244
01:18:44,430 --> 01:18:46,620
it maybe it is meant to just exist in

2245
01:18:46,620 --> 01:18:48,330
this world where this extreme simplicity

2246
01:18:48,330 --> 01:18:51,300
in this extreme complicated batshit

2247
01:18:51,300 --> 01:18:53,550
insane plot can exist together and just

2248
01:18:53,550 --> 01:18:56,010
sort of create its own weird set up I

2249
01:18:56,010 --> 01:18:57,570
don't know if that necessarily makes a

2250
01:18:57,570 --> 01:18:59,550
classic but it definitely makes an

2251
01:18:59,550 --> 01:19:01,770
interesting experience and at the heart

2252
01:19:01,770 --> 01:19:03,990
of it is still some likable character

2253
01:19:03,990 --> 01:19:06,030
some enjoyable animation and a whole lot

2254
01:19:06,030 --> 01:19:08,310
of charm I really like watching this kid

2255
01:19:08,310 --> 01:19:10,320
and just how ambitious and excited she

2256
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:13,020
is the tiniest things just get her going

2257
01:19:13,020 --> 01:19:15,450
nuts and yeah her happiness is kind of

2258
01:19:15,450 --> 01:19:17,640
contagious so does the film make a lot

2259
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:20,460
of sense no but is it meant to probably

2260
01:19:20,460 --> 01:19:22,740
not the two words I constantly hear from

2261
01:19:22,740 --> 01:19:25,170
people in describing it is weird but

2262
01:19:25,170 --> 01:19:26,910
cute and I think that's sort of the

2263
01:19:26,910 --> 01:19:28,950
reaction I get out of it too it's crazy

2264
01:19:28,950 --> 01:19:30,930
but it's adorable it's all over the

2265
01:19:30,930 --> 01:19:32,610
place that's a lot of fun too I

2266
01:19:32,610 --> 01:19:34,590
definitely won't put up there with Kiki

2267
01:19:34,590 --> 01:19:36,540
or spirited away but it's definitely a

2268
01:19:36,540 --> 01:19:38,040
movie that's likable enough to put out a

2269
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:40,410
few times take a look and experience the

2270
01:19:40,410 --> 01:19:41,700
madness for yourself

2271
01:19:41,700 --> 01:19:53,790
[Music]

2272
01:19:53,790 --> 01:19:56,160
[Music]

2273
01:19:56,160 --> 01:19:59,110
The Secret World of Arrietty seems very

2274
01:19:59,110 --> 01:20:01,390
much returning to the form that films

2275
01:20:01,390 --> 01:20:03,820
like Kiki and Totoro did except in this

2276
01:20:03,820 --> 01:20:05,800
case they take the idea of a very small

2277
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:08,200
story and literally make it a very small

2278
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:10,450
story based on the book the borrower's

2279
01:20:10,450 --> 01:20:13,240
we follow the world of very tiny people

2280
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:15,490
that live in a little house and how they

2281
01:20:15,490 --> 01:20:16,990
manage to get around without ever being

2282
01:20:16,990 --> 01:20:19,240
seen but our main character Arrietty

2283
01:20:19,240 --> 01:20:21,820
does get seen once coming across a boy

2284
01:20:21,820 --> 01:20:23,710
who apparently seems to be very slowly

2285
01:20:23,710 --> 01:20:25,780
dying he seems to have come to peace

2286
01:20:25,780 --> 01:20:27,610
with it and talks about his life with

2287
01:20:27,610 --> 01:20:29,740
her over time they find they have a lot

2288
01:20:29,740 --> 01:20:31,660
in common share a lot their experiences

2289
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:34,000
and form a very strong friendship but

2290
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,590
things start to get a little crazy when

2291
01:20:35,590 --> 01:20:36,820
one of the other people in the house

2292
01:20:36,820 --> 01:20:38,590
starts to think there are little people

2293
01:20:38,590 --> 01:20:40,000
that are roaming through the wood and

2294
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,070
dedicates all of her time and effort to

2295
01:20:42,070 --> 01:20:44,320
finding out where once again that's

2296
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:46,420
about all there is to the story but once

2297
01:20:46,420 --> 01:20:48,640
again that's about all that you need the

2298
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:50,650
characters are all very likeable and all

2299
01:20:50,650 --> 01:20:52,870
very intelligent I really like hearing

2300
01:20:52,870 --> 01:20:54,430
the conversations that they share with

2301
01:20:54,430 --> 01:20:56,530
one another you really feel a sense of

2302
01:20:56,530 --> 01:20:58,900
family in this film a lot of films I see

2303
01:20:58,900 --> 01:21:01,000
that focus on family have a lot of jokes

2304
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,490
and one-liners and put-downs and stuff

2305
01:21:03,490 --> 01:21:05,620
kind of like a sitcom here everyone

2306
01:21:05,620 --> 01:21:07,720
seems to talk like a real person the

2307
01:21:07,720 --> 01:21:09,220
only one who seems to speak differently

2308
01:21:09,220 --> 01:21:10,900
is the boy with the terminal illness but

2309
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:12,550
that's a boy with a terminal illness

2310
01:21:12,550 --> 01:21:14,620
it's really fascinating to get inside

2311
01:21:14,620 --> 01:21:16,870
his mindset to hear how he sees the

2312
01:21:16,870 --> 01:21:18,730
world and how he feels so very small in

2313
01:21:18,730 --> 01:21:20,140
it which of course is very fitting

2314
01:21:20,140 --> 01:21:22,450
telling this to a very small person they

2315
01:21:22,450 --> 01:21:23,890
both have big worlds with big

2316
01:21:23,890 --> 01:21:25,480
limitations and yet for entirely

2317
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:27,550
different reasons but even for all

2318
01:21:27,550 --> 01:21:29,080
they're talking there's still a lot of

2319
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:31,360
visual imagination to this movie even

2320
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:32,920
just them trying to get across the

2321
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:35,020
kitchen is like this really big event

2322
01:21:35,020 --> 01:21:36,610
there's a great scene where they have to

2323
01:21:36,610 --> 01:21:38,350
do it at night and they have to be quiet

2324
01:21:38,350 --> 01:21:39,910
it's almost like watching an episode of

2325
01:21:39,910 --> 01:21:41,560
Mission Impossible it's just so

2326
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:43,900
suspenseful and it's also great to see

2327
01:21:43,900 --> 01:21:45,760
just how they get through this world all

2328
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:47,590
the little secret passages all the

2329
01:21:47,590 --> 01:21:49,720
devices that they make the engineering

2330
01:21:49,720 --> 01:21:51,130
even at such a small scale is very

2331
01:21:51,130 --> 01:21:53,410
impressive the only downside I have

2332
01:21:53,410 --> 01:21:54,970
which I'm starting to accept more and

2333
01:21:54,970 --> 01:21:56,440
more it's just sort of a criticism of

2334
01:21:56,440 --> 01:21:58,480
Japanese cinema I think is that the

2335
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:00,400
ending once again seems a little rushed

2336
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:02,979
at least in the placement of the credit

2337
01:22:02,979 --> 01:22:04,689
the movie seems to be building up to a

2338
01:22:04,689 --> 01:22:06,459
proper epilogue and then they just start

2339
01:22:06,459 --> 01:22:08,139
showing the names of everybody that's in

2340
01:22:08,139 --> 01:22:10,179
it doesn't it usually mean it's time to

2341
01:22:10,179 --> 01:22:12,039
get up and time to walk away I can't

2342
01:22:12,039 --> 01:22:13,359
really focus on what they're showing me

2343
01:22:13,359 --> 01:22:15,159
if I'm reading the people that worked on

2344
01:22:15,159 --> 01:22:16,869
the film and I really would like to have

2345
01:22:16,869 --> 01:22:18,489
been totally engrossed in that and just

2346
01:22:18,489 --> 01:22:20,169
watch that without a bunch of names

2347
01:22:20,169 --> 01:22:22,239
flashing in front of me I don't get the

2348
01:22:22,239 --> 01:22:24,010
creative choice but I can definitely say

2349
01:22:24,010 --> 01:22:25,899
it happens and a lot of animated films

2350
01:22:25,899 --> 01:22:28,359
from Japan maybe it's a creative style I

2351
01:22:28,359 --> 01:22:30,280
don't get but it does kind of bother me

2352
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:33,189
but it in no way ruins the film this is

2353
01:22:33,189 --> 01:22:35,769
a really charming likable piece it's not

2354
01:22:35,769 --> 01:22:37,959
any huge epic but at the same time you

2355
01:22:37,959 --> 01:22:39,820
do really get sucked into a lot of their

2356
01:22:39,820 --> 01:22:41,619
problems you do kind of take a little

2357
01:22:41,619 --> 01:22:43,209
bit of a gasp whenever they're about to

2358
01:22:43,209 --> 01:22:45,099
be seen you do kind of become fearful

2359
01:22:45,099 --> 01:22:46,899
that they might get caught but at the

2360
01:22:46,899 --> 01:22:48,639
same time you enjoy the simpler moments

2361
01:22:48,639 --> 01:22:50,289
of them just sitting back and having a

2362
01:22:50,289 --> 01:22:52,119
conversation about the greater things as

2363
01:22:52,119 --> 01:22:54,010
well as the smaller things I really

2364
01:22:54,010 --> 01:22:55,419
liked it and I definitely enjoyed it

2365
01:22:55,419 --> 01:22:57,309
it's very laid back structure if you're

2366
01:22:57,309 --> 01:22:58,749
looking for big adventure you'll get

2367
01:22:58,749 --> 01:23:00,639
elements of it here there but it's

2368
01:23:00,639 --> 01:23:03,189
mostly a very calm subdued family film

2369
01:23:03,189 --> 01:23:05,079
but hey what the hell is wrong with that

2370
01:23:05,079 --> 01:23:11,949
give it a shot and see for yourself

2371
01:23:11,949 --> 01:23:24,039
a part of me says I should really hate

2372
01:23:24,039 --> 01:23:27,280
from up on poppy Hill like really hated

2373
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:31,239
this is a phenomenally cliched story a

2374
01:23:31,239 --> 01:23:33,219
high school girl comes across a high

2375
01:23:33,219 --> 01:23:35,860
school boy who big shock don't get along

2376
01:23:35,860 --> 01:23:37,840
but the more they hang out the more they

2377
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:39,909
realize maybe they can get along and

2378
01:23:39,909 --> 01:23:42,280
start to form a romantic connection but

2379
01:23:42,280 --> 01:23:44,349
once she shows that her father has died

2380
01:23:44,349 --> 01:23:46,719
in the war and he sees the picture guess

2381
01:23:46,719 --> 01:23:49,420
what by huge coincidence it looks like

2382
01:23:49,420 --> 01:23:52,059
her father was also his father and they

2383
01:23:52,059 --> 01:23:54,489
may be brother and sister even he

2384
01:23:54,489 --> 01:23:56,499
himself says it's kind of like a bad

2385
01:23:56,499 --> 01:23:59,320
melodrama frustrated by this they try to

2386
01:23:59,320 --> 01:24:00,999
figure out what they're supposed to do

2387
01:24:00,999 --> 01:24:02,979
while interacting with all sorts of

2388
01:24:02,979 --> 01:24:04,959
goofy characters and learning life

2389
01:24:04,959 --> 01:24:07,360
lessons and interacting with adults who

2390
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:09,340
are sometimes right sometimes wrong

2391
01:24:09,340 --> 01:24:11,829
while constantly hearing the goofy music

2392
01:24:11,829 --> 01:24:14,289
that just celebrates a time of being

2393
01:24:14,289 --> 01:24:18,010
young yeah it sounds pretty standard and

2394
01:24:18,010 --> 01:24:20,260
done a million times and in many

2395
01:24:20,260 --> 01:24:22,840
respects it kind of is I was kind of

2396
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:24,550
rolling my eyes that these are the turns

2397
01:24:24,550 --> 01:24:26,559
that this story is taking but at the

2398
01:24:26,559 --> 01:24:28,570
same time I did find myself kind of

2399
01:24:28,570 --> 01:24:30,400
wrapped up in it I think a lot of that

2400
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:32,289
comes from not only the pacing in the

2401
01:24:32,289 --> 01:24:34,209
animation style which is beautiful to

2402
01:24:34,209 --> 01:24:36,670
look at but also some really damn good

2403
01:24:36,670 --> 01:24:39,729
voice acting I mean the voice acting in

2404
01:24:39,729 --> 01:24:41,199
the American dubs of the Ghibli films

2405
01:24:41,199 --> 01:24:42,610
have usually been spectacular and

2406
01:24:42,610 --> 01:24:44,469
Disney's done a wonderful job but this

2407
01:24:44,469 --> 01:24:46,959
one especially seems good because unlike

2408
01:24:46,959 --> 01:24:48,909
the other Ghibli films there's not a lot

2409
01:24:48,909 --> 01:24:51,789
of supernatural elements or magical

2410
01:24:51,789 --> 01:24:54,099
seams or weird angles or anything like

2411
01:24:54,099 --> 01:24:56,260
that it's just sort of straightforward

2412
01:24:56,260 --> 01:24:57,699
what you see is what you get

2413
01:24:57,699 --> 01:25:00,130
therefore the performances have to be

2414
01:25:00,130 --> 01:25:01,900
good or it's gonna lose you very quickly

2415
01:25:01,900 --> 01:25:04,300
I'm really amazed at not only how well

2416
01:25:04,300 --> 01:25:05,709
they match the lit movements but how

2417
01:25:05,709 --> 01:25:07,690
they keep the emotion of the characters

2418
01:25:07,690 --> 01:25:10,479
totally intact while doing so everybody

2419
01:25:10,479 --> 01:25:12,219
has a slip-up here or there even the

2420
01:25:12,219 --> 01:25:14,860
best actors but this one seems really on

2421
01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:16,809
track it seems to hit everything pitch

2422
01:25:16,809 --> 01:25:19,209
perfect another strong point is its side

2423
01:25:19,209 --> 01:25:21,459
stories which I get are a little cliched

2424
01:25:21,459 --> 01:25:23,590
but so much time is dedicated to them I

2425
01:25:23,590 --> 01:25:25,480
do find myself actually getting pretty

2426
01:25:25,480 --> 01:25:27,460
dumpin up for example there's a building

2427
01:25:27,460 --> 01:25:28,870
that holds a bunch of school clubs

2428
01:25:28,870 --> 01:25:30,760
that's going to be torn down all the

2429
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:32,860
students inside most of the boys are

2430
01:25:32,860 --> 01:25:34,570
pissed off and constantly fighting to

2431
01:25:34,570 --> 01:25:36,489
keep it around however with the help of

2432
01:25:36,489 --> 01:25:38,200
our main character and her friends they

2433
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:40,060
show that a big part is the appearance

2434
01:25:40,060 --> 01:25:41,680
and that if they clean it up get it

2435
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:43,330
looking nice and stop being awkward

2436
01:25:43,330 --> 01:25:45,040
social shut-ins maybe they'll have a

2437
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:47,110
better chance to save it at first I was

2438
01:25:47,110 --> 01:25:49,000
kind of annoyed at what cutouts a lot of

2439
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,560
these boys seem like just the

2440
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:53,230
traditional nerds and said traditional

2441
01:25:53,230 --> 01:25:56,320
nerdy things but after a while I really

2442
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:58,120
didn't want to see that place go I

2443
01:25:58,120 --> 01:26:00,040
really found myself liking it

2444
01:26:00,040 --> 01:26:01,390
I even grew accustomed to some of these

2445
01:26:01,390 --> 01:26:02,860
oddballs even if they were kind of

2446
01:26:02,860 --> 01:26:05,470
cliched so on the one hand yeah it is

2447
01:26:05,470 --> 01:26:07,000
kind of a story that's been done a

2448
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,160
million times the coming-of-age story

2449
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:12,040
that's in the 60s and kind of American

2450
01:26:12,040 --> 01:26:14,380
Graffiti ish meets animal house ish

2451
01:26:14,380 --> 01:26:16,420
meets I don't know just a million other

2452
01:26:16,420 --> 01:26:18,430
movies you've seen before but I think

2453
01:26:18,430 --> 01:26:20,260
with a visual touch some really good

2454
01:26:20,260 --> 01:26:22,570
acting and some really decent pacing and

2455
01:26:22,570 --> 01:26:24,910
atmosphere it actually comes out okay

2456
01:26:24,910 --> 01:26:27,010
can you feel the manipulation when it's

2457
01:26:27,010 --> 01:26:29,230
going on absolutely but you can also

2458
01:26:29,230 --> 01:26:31,630
kind of feel the charm of it too slowly

2459
01:26:31,630 --> 01:26:33,910
over time I do still see a lot of major

2460
01:26:33,910 --> 01:26:36,100
problems with it especially with the

2461
01:26:36,100 --> 01:26:38,530
music that seems constantly on all the

2462
01:26:38,530 --> 01:26:40,300
time but even that starts to die down

2463
01:26:40,300 --> 01:26:42,310
after a while and you start to hear

2464
01:26:42,310 --> 01:26:43,390
these people for what they're really

2465
01:26:43,390 --> 01:26:45,550
saying and maybe you start to see the

2466
01:26:45,550 --> 01:26:47,500
movie for what it's really doing be a

2467
01:26:47,500 --> 01:26:49,270
charming little film that may have been

2468
01:26:49,270 --> 01:26:51,310
done a million times before but maybe

2469
01:26:51,310 --> 01:26:52,870
isn't trying to do anything that new

2470
01:26:52,870 --> 01:26:55,210
just try to do it in a way that standard

2471
01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:58,030
but charming at least charming enough

2472
01:26:58,030 --> 01:27:00,100
until you probably have to be pretty

2473
01:27:00,100 --> 01:27:01,930
forgiving in order to really get into

2474
01:27:01,930 --> 01:27:03,550
this film but if you lower down your

2475
01:27:03,550 --> 01:27:05,560
defenses a little bit it isn't half bad

2476
01:27:05,560 --> 01:27:07,720
not a great experience but not a harsh

2477
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:09,130
one either if you're looking for a

2478
01:27:09,130 --> 01:27:11,020
romance that's standard but Pleasant

2479
01:27:11,020 --> 01:27:12,940
this isn't a bad one to check out

2480
01:27:12,940 --> 01:27:28,610
[Music]

2481
01:27:28,610 --> 01:27:30,680
[Music]

2482
01:27:30,680 --> 01:27:33,330
let's finish off Disney cember with the

2483
01:27:33,330 --> 01:27:36,600
wind rises' Miyazaki's final film which

2484
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:38,490
yeah he said a couple times before it

2485
01:27:38,490 --> 01:27:40,110
but hey Who am I to complain if he wants

2486
01:27:40,110 --> 01:27:41,460
to make more movies they're always great

2487
01:27:41,460 --> 01:27:43,500
as far as I know this is the first time

2488
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:45,720
he's actually taken on a true story the

2489
01:27:45,720 --> 01:27:47,370
film centers around the life of a

2490
01:27:47,370 --> 01:27:49,320
designer who created the Japanese World

2491
01:27:49,320 --> 01:27:51,930
War two fighting planes many many people

2492
01:27:51,930 --> 01:27:54,150
would see this as a bad person but the

2493
01:27:54,150 --> 01:27:55,710
film makes it very clear that all he

2494
01:27:55,710 --> 01:27:57,750
wants to do is be innovative and pushed

2495
01:27:57,750 --> 01:27:59,280
the boundaries of what can be done with

2496
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:01,350
technology it shown very clearly that

2497
01:28:01,350 --> 01:28:03,090
even from his youth all he's ever wanted

2498
01:28:03,090 --> 01:28:05,550
to do was push the envelope and the film

2499
01:28:05,550 --> 01:28:07,620
rather than focus on the controversies

2500
01:28:07,620 --> 01:28:09,390
of what it led to though don't get me

2501
01:28:09,390 --> 01:28:10,860
wrong it's not entirely ignored either

2502
01:28:10,860 --> 01:28:13,170
focus is instead on the innovation in

2503
01:28:13,170 --> 01:28:14,550
the imagination to bring these

2504
01:28:14,550 --> 01:28:16,590
incredible wonders to life in some

2505
01:28:16,590 --> 01:28:18,150
respects it's the most downplayed out

2506
01:28:18,150 --> 01:28:19,950
than Miyazaki films I mean there's not

2507
01:28:19,950 --> 01:28:22,470
really any monsters or moving castles or

2508
01:28:22,470 --> 01:28:24,210
anything like that he still finds a way

2509
01:28:24,210 --> 01:28:25,890
to incorporate so much beauty and so

2510
01:28:25,890 --> 01:28:28,140
much artistry into it for example he

2511
01:28:28,140 --> 01:28:30,090
constantly gets visits in his dreams

2512
01:28:30,090 --> 01:28:32,160
from his heroes great inventors and

2513
01:28:32,160 --> 01:28:33,750
creators who are constantly encouraging

2514
01:28:33,750 --> 01:28:35,310
him to try and find a way to make

2515
01:28:35,310 --> 01:28:37,620
himself even better he also comes across

2516
01:28:37,620 --> 01:28:39,390
a lot of places that happen to look

2517
01:28:39,390 --> 01:28:40,950
beautiful and even survives an

2518
01:28:40,950 --> 01:28:42,690
earthquake that as you imagine being a

2519
01:28:42,690 --> 01:28:44,490
Miyazaki film is pretty incredible to

2520
01:28:44,490 --> 01:28:46,410
watch again one of the charms of

2521
01:28:46,410 --> 01:28:48,090
Miyazaki is that you can be technically

2522
01:28:48,090 --> 01:28:50,610
not watching much just a guy working on

2523
01:28:50,610 --> 01:28:53,010
a plane or talking about ideas or

2524
01:28:53,010 --> 01:28:54,540
working with other people but there's

2525
01:28:54,540 --> 01:28:56,940
such a likeable ambition and atmosphere

2526
01:28:56,940 --> 01:28:59,310
and environment to all of it you want to

2527
01:28:59,310 --> 01:29:00,750
get to know these people you want to

2528
01:29:00,750 --> 01:29:02,400
help them with their planes and knowing

2529
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:04,410
Miyazaki's love for gears and gadgets

2530
01:29:04,410 --> 01:29:07,170
this film has all sorts of that creating

2531
01:29:07,170 --> 01:29:09,870
building failing trying again and you

2532
01:29:09,870 --> 01:29:11,460
really admire this guy for having a

2533
01:29:11,460 --> 01:29:13,440
dream trying his damndest to follow it

2534
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:15,060
all the way through even if in the end

2535
01:29:15,060 --> 01:29:17,640
it would amount to something horrible as

2536
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:19,770
I said before the film doesn't ignore

2537
01:29:19,770 --> 01:29:21,660
the fact that this resulted in the

2538
01:29:21,660 --> 01:29:23,340
deaths of so many people there's

2539
01:29:23,340 --> 01:29:24,810
definitely people dropping hints about

2540
01:29:24,810 --> 01:29:26,670
the Nazi Party and what he's getting

2541
01:29:26,670 --> 01:29:28,170
involved in and

2542
01:29:28,170 --> 01:29:29,429
all the way through it he doesn't know

2543
01:29:29,429 --> 01:29:31,260
what to do he just wants to create he

2544
01:29:31,260 --> 01:29:33,300
wants to be the inventor I suppose a lot

2545
01:29:33,300 --> 01:29:34,679
of people could look at him as a bad

2546
01:29:34,679 --> 01:29:36,330
person for this but it's also kind of

2547
01:29:36,330 --> 01:29:38,160
like Einstein here's a guy who created

2548
01:29:38,160 --> 01:29:40,260
the atomic bomb one of the greatest

2549
01:29:40,260 --> 01:29:42,449
destroyers of human life yet we still

2550
01:29:42,449 --> 01:29:44,250
see him as a genius and there's

2551
01:29:44,250 --> 01:29:45,390
definitely people that don't like him

2552
01:29:45,390 --> 01:29:46,980
too because of that but there's no

2553
01:29:46,980 --> 01:29:48,719
denying that there's still a brilliant

2554
01:29:48,719 --> 01:29:50,429
mind at work that used a lot of

2555
01:29:50,429 --> 01:29:53,070
creativity imagination and determination

2556
01:29:53,070 --> 01:29:55,020
to do what they thought was going to be

2557
01:29:55,020 --> 01:29:56,820
a great thing and I think that's the

2558
01:29:56,820 --> 01:29:58,739
best thing to admire about this film the

2559
01:29:58,739 --> 01:30:00,390
ambition the ambition of the main

2560
01:30:00,390 --> 01:30:02,130
character the ambition of him trying to

2561
01:30:02,130 --> 01:30:03,960
get his ideas done and trying to do what

2562
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:06,870
he loves to do there's a wonderful final

2563
01:30:06,870 --> 01:30:08,670
imagery of discussing with one of his

2564
01:30:08,670 --> 01:30:10,560
masters what he's done and what he's

2565
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:11,340
created

2566
01:30:11,340 --> 01:30:13,590
it's a beautiful yet haunting landscape

2567
01:30:13,590 --> 01:30:15,810
of a bunch of people dead and plains

2568
01:30:15,810 --> 01:30:17,640
destroyed yet it's in this beautiful

2569
01:30:17,640 --> 01:30:19,590
green field of imagination and

2570
01:30:19,590 --> 01:30:22,679
possibility it's such a weird mix but

2571
01:30:22,679 --> 01:30:24,510
it's also the perfect bittersweet sum up

2572
01:30:24,510 --> 01:30:26,250
to everything this guy was working for

2573
01:30:26,250 --> 01:30:28,140
the problems I have with the film are

2574
01:30:28,140 --> 01:30:29,250
very minor

2575
01:30:29,250 --> 01:30:31,140
for example the romance in the film

2576
01:30:31,140 --> 01:30:33,060
though I don't know the real story about

2577
01:30:33,060 --> 01:30:36,179
it seems a touch forced he meets this

2578
01:30:36,179 --> 01:30:37,590
woman by accident during an earthquake

2579
01:30:37,590 --> 01:30:39,570
and then years later they happen to

2580
01:30:39,570 --> 01:30:41,910
stumble across each other again and even

2581
01:30:41,910 --> 01:30:43,530
without knowing each other very well

2582
01:30:43,530 --> 01:30:45,780
they decide to suddenly get married it's

2583
01:30:45,780 --> 01:30:47,310
almost something like out of a 40s

2584
01:30:47,310 --> 01:30:49,739
Disney fairy tale again I don't know if

2585
01:30:49,739 --> 01:30:51,150
that was intentional or if it was a

2586
01:30:51,150 --> 01:30:53,250
cultural thing but it was definitely a

2587
01:30:53,250 --> 01:30:55,050
little odd it's not that they have no

2588
01:30:55,050 --> 01:30:57,120
chemistry but for a film we know is

2589
01:30:57,120 --> 01:30:59,160
supposed to be based on real life it's a

2590
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:01,290
touch distracting I also start to notice

2591
01:31:01,290 --> 01:31:02,610
things that I guess I never really

2592
01:31:02,610 --> 01:31:04,290
picked up from Miyazaki before that are

2593
01:31:04,290 --> 01:31:06,239
also a little weird like he never really

2594
01:31:06,239 --> 01:31:08,460
does sweating or crying correctly it

2595
01:31:08,460 --> 01:31:09,810
always kind of looks like they have some

2596
01:31:09,810 --> 01:31:12,150
sort of sickness plus I know this guy is

2597
01:31:12,150 --> 01:31:13,650
trying to be helpful and everything but

2598
01:31:13,650 --> 01:31:16,020
he scares the out of me something

2599
01:31:16,020 --> 01:31:18,330
about those eyes they just don't look

2600
01:31:18,330 --> 01:31:19,980
right it looks like some sort of weird

2601
01:31:19,980 --> 01:31:22,080
demon that I don't know could they have

2602
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:23,969
fixed that up or something but aside

2603
01:31:23,969 --> 01:31:25,890
from that this film is very obviously a

2604
01:31:25,890 --> 01:31:28,440
romanticized version of true life events

2605
01:31:28,440 --> 01:31:30,989
yeah a lot of it technically happen but

2606
01:31:30,989 --> 01:31:32,550
it's pretty clear there is a lot of

2607
01:31:32,550 --> 01:31:34,560
creative liberties but never to a point

2608
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:36,600
where it's insulting it's kind of like

2609
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:38,489
tombstone they got the basic story in

2610
01:31:38,489 --> 01:31:39,409
people down

2611
01:31:39,409 --> 01:31:41,599
but yeah they obviously change stuff up

2612
01:31:41,599 --> 01:31:43,820
to make it flow a little nicer and be a

2613
01:31:43,820 --> 01:31:45,919
little bit more epic and you can usually

2614
01:31:45,919 --> 01:31:47,989
tell when those moments on earth I think

2615
01:31:47,989 --> 01:31:49,849
what impressed me most though is only in

2616
01:31:49,849 --> 01:31:51,739
the last 10 minutes was I starting to

2617
01:31:51,739 --> 01:31:53,659
get a little tired and saying to myself

2618
01:31:53,659 --> 01:31:56,119
I wonder how long this movie is but then

2619
01:31:56,119 --> 01:31:57,320
when I checked out and saw it was a

2620
01:31:57,320 --> 01:31:59,539
hundred and 26 minutes I couldn't

2621
01:31:59,539 --> 01:32:01,699
believe it only in the last few did I

2622
01:32:01,699 --> 01:32:03,320
realize how long it was and through the

2623
01:32:03,320 --> 01:32:05,059
rest of it I was just enjoying it so

2624
01:32:05,059 --> 01:32:07,249
much I can't believe a biography about a

2625
01:32:07,249 --> 01:32:09,829
guy making planes had me so invested and

2626
01:32:09,829 --> 01:32:11,869
so drawn in that I was actually willing

2627
01:32:11,869 --> 01:32:13,610
to sit there for a hundred 26 minutes

2628
01:32:13,610 --> 01:32:15,139
without even realizing I was sitting

2629
01:32:15,139 --> 01:32:17,059
there for that long if this did turn out

2630
01:32:17,059 --> 01:32:18,889
to be Miyazaki's last film it would

2631
01:32:18,889 --> 01:32:20,269
definitely be a good one to go out on

2632
01:32:20,269 --> 01:32:21,949
it's very clear he has this incredible

2633
01:32:21,949 --> 01:32:24,050
respect for someone that just wants to

2634
01:32:24,050 --> 01:32:25,760
follow his dreams and do something

2635
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:28,039
incredible failing time after time but

2636
01:32:28,039 --> 01:32:29,929
still getting right back up to try again

2637
01:32:29,929 --> 01:32:32,479
much like Miyazaki it's a guy who loves

2638
01:32:32,479 --> 01:32:34,429
his work and loves doing beyond what he

2639
01:32:34,429 --> 01:32:36,169
thought he was capable of definitely

2640
01:32:36,169 --> 01:32:37,729
might push some people's sensibilities

2641
01:32:37,729 --> 01:32:39,349
the wrong way but I think the focus of

2642
01:32:39,349 --> 01:32:40,789
the film was to look at the power of

2643
01:32:40,789 --> 01:32:43,159
imagination and perseverance and hard

2644
01:32:43,159 --> 01:32:45,229
work and dedicating yourself to never

2645
01:32:45,229 --> 01:32:46,939
giving up and doing something incredible

2646
01:32:46,939 --> 01:32:48,499
and I can say that's definitely what

2647
01:32:48,499 --> 01:32:49,519
I've gotten out of the Studio Ghibli

2648
01:32:49,519 --> 01:32:51,760
films a world of imagination

2649
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:54,650
entertainment and so much hard work that

2650
01:32:54,650 --> 01:32:55,519
went into it

2651
01:32:55,519 --> 01:32:57,380
so many of these films are classics in a

2652
01:32:57,380 --> 01:32:58,880
lot of people's eyes and they deserve to

2653
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:00,739
be classics and even more people's eyes

2654
01:33:00,739 --> 01:33:03,050
people this dedicated hard-working and

2655
01:33:03,050 --> 01:33:04,699
are able to get their ideas to the big

2656
01:33:04,699 --> 01:33:06,439
screen should be celebrated as much as

2657
01:33:06,439 --> 01:33:08,179
possible so thank you so much for

2658
01:33:08,179 --> 01:33:10,130
joining me in this Disney cember like I

2659
01:33:10,130 --> 01:33:11,749
said before there are a couple popular

2660
01:33:11,749 --> 01:33:13,880
demands I'll throw in in January but for

2661
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:15,229
the most part I wanna say thanks to you

2662
01:33:15,229 --> 01:33:16,880
guys for always making this such a fun

2663
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:18,829
experience to put these together share

2664
01:33:18,829 --> 01:33:20,659
my opinions share yours as well

2665
01:33:20,659 --> 01:33:22,159
and keep talking about great artwork

2666
01:33:22,159 --> 01:33:24,320
that comes from great people keep alive

2667
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:26,989
those great ideas determination artistry

2668
01:33:26,989 --> 01:33:29,239
and always allow great imagination to

2669
01:33:29,239 --> 01:33:33,340
take

2670
01:33:33,340 --> 01:33:48,740
[Music]

2671
01:33:48,740 --> 01:33:50,260
[Music]

2672
01:33:50,260 --> 01:33:53,390
by popular demand the tale of Princess

2673
01:33:53,390 --> 01:33:55,880
Kaguya based on the famous Japanese

2674
01:33:55,880 --> 01:33:58,340
folktale that sadly I don't really know

2675
01:33:58,340 --> 01:34:00,170
so I'm not gonna be able to compare that

2676
01:34:00,170 --> 01:34:01,969
much what I do know though is that this

2677
01:34:01,969 --> 01:34:03,770
is a film that has a totally distinct

2678
01:34:03,770 --> 01:34:05,989
artistic style that is all its own it

2679
01:34:05,989 --> 01:34:08,300
has this incredible simplicity to its

2680
01:34:08,300 --> 01:34:10,280
technique which can often work in its

2681
01:34:10,280 --> 01:34:12,949
favor and other times possibly be a

2682
01:34:12,949 --> 01:34:14,989
little stale which is fitting because

2683
01:34:14,989 --> 01:34:18,260
the film itself kinda has that feel to

2684
01:34:18,260 --> 01:34:20,239
it but before you kill me let's go ahead

2685
01:34:20,239 --> 01:34:22,310
and actually look at the story a man

2686
01:34:22,310 --> 01:34:24,140
cutting bamboo in the forest subtly

2687
01:34:24,140 --> 01:34:26,150
comes across a baby inside one of the

2688
01:34:26,150 --> 01:34:28,280
trees at first she looks like royalty

2689
01:34:28,280 --> 01:34:29,840
but then she suddenly becomes a real

2690
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:31,940
little kid he takes her home to his wife

2691
01:34:31,940 --> 01:34:33,620
and he's totally convinced that this is

2692
01:34:33,620 --> 01:34:35,750
a princess or at least that she's

2693
01:34:35,750 --> 01:34:37,790
supposed to grow up into a princess why

2694
01:34:37,790 --> 01:34:39,050
else would she look like royalty when

2695
01:34:39,050 --> 01:34:40,880
she was born convinced that her status

2696
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:42,590
is going to mean everything the father

2697
01:34:42,590 --> 01:34:44,330
does everything he can to try and buy

2698
01:34:44,330 --> 01:34:45,739
her all the things he thinks she

2699
01:34:45,739 --> 01:34:47,870
deserves the mother is not as concerned

2700
01:34:47,870 --> 01:34:49,730
about her status as much as she just

2701
01:34:49,730 --> 01:34:51,680
grows up happy one minute she's a baby

2702
01:34:51,680 --> 01:34:53,180
the next day she's a little girl the

2703
01:34:53,180 --> 01:34:55,280
next possibly a teenager they're not

2704
01:34:55,280 --> 01:34:56,750
sure why this is but they try everything

2705
01:34:56,750 --> 01:34:58,730
in their power to not only love her but

2706
01:34:58,730 --> 01:35:00,949
also try to get a royal position which

2707
01:35:00,949 --> 01:35:03,290
Ellen Midd is a little confusing in this

2708
01:35:03,290 --> 01:35:05,120
world they sort of get her etiquette

2709
01:35:05,120 --> 01:35:07,489
lessons and get this really nice place

2710
01:35:07,489 --> 01:35:10,010
to live in but her parents aren't king

2711
01:35:10,010 --> 01:35:12,890
or queen so why would she be a princess

2712
01:35:12,890 --> 01:35:14,870
either way that doesn't seem to stop

2713
01:35:14,870 --> 01:35:16,580
them as they go around parading to

2714
01:35:16,580 --> 01:35:17,930
everybody that she has in fact a

2715
01:35:17,930 --> 01:35:18,560
princess

2716
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:20,090
soon she starts getting all this

2717
01:35:20,090 --> 01:35:21,860
attention and all these suitors start

2718
01:35:21,860 --> 01:35:24,320
coming in but as par for the course she

2719
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:25,940
doesn't really like being a princess

2720
01:35:25,940 --> 01:35:27,710
doesn't really like the suitors and is

2721
01:35:27,710 --> 01:35:29,750
constantly getting into trouble as time

2722
01:35:29,750 --> 01:35:31,310
goes on she does discover her real

2723
01:35:31,310 --> 01:35:33,739
origin and if I say anymore it would

2724
01:35:33,739 --> 01:35:35,630
kind of give things away let's just say

2725
01:35:35,630 --> 01:35:37,310
it's definitely more supernatural stuff

2726
01:35:37,310 --> 01:35:39,170
the best parts of the film are the

2727
01:35:39,170 --> 01:35:40,969
beginning and the ending the beginning

2728
01:35:40,969 --> 01:35:42,530
for the tight family connection and how

2729
01:35:42,530 --> 01:35:44,239
loveable they are working off each other

2730
01:35:44,239 --> 01:35:45,830
in the ending for it's a dreamlike

2731
01:35:45,830 --> 01:35:48,350
imagery as well as tone with sort of a

2732
01:35:48,350 --> 01:35:50,690
bittersweet send-off I dare say it's

2733
01:35:50,690 --> 01:35:51,290
almost

2734
01:35:51,290 --> 01:35:53,720
little too strange and how rushed it is

2735
01:35:53,720 --> 01:35:55,580
but it still leaves an interesting

2736
01:35:55,580 --> 01:35:57,650
feeling the middle is where it's the

2737
01:35:57,650 --> 01:36:00,320
toughest to get through one we've seen

2738
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:02,210
all these cliches before the princess

2739
01:36:02,210 --> 01:36:03,770
who doesn't want to be a princess so

2740
01:36:03,770 --> 01:36:05,300
she's going to fight back and be

2741
01:36:05,300 --> 01:36:06,890
rebellious and all the people are gonna

2742
01:36:06,890 --> 01:36:08,600
tell her to be this other thing and yeah

2743
01:36:08,600 --> 01:36:10,880
yeah yeah seen it seen it not too much

2744
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:13,190
that's new but on top of that it is just

2745
01:36:13,190 --> 01:36:15,650
so slow-moving there are so many moments

2746
01:36:15,650 --> 01:36:18,140
that drag on and on I remember thinking

2747
01:36:18,140 --> 01:36:19,790
to myself this should be over in a few

2748
01:36:19,790 --> 01:36:21,890
minutes why are we focusing 10 to 20

2749
01:36:21,890 --> 01:36:23,990
minutes on some of these subplots for

2750
01:36:23,990 --> 01:36:25,880
example she gives a challenge to each of

2751
01:36:25,880 --> 01:36:27,380
these three suitors that try to win her

2752
01:36:27,380 --> 01:36:29,540
hand they're all impossible challenges

2753
01:36:29,540 --> 01:36:31,640
but nevertheless all the suitors try and

2754
01:36:31,640 --> 01:36:33,320
accommodate anyway this should only take

2755
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:35,810
out like 5-10 minutes of the film's time

2756
01:36:35,810 --> 01:36:37,610
but I think it goes on for something

2757
01:36:37,610 --> 01:36:40,910
like 20 or 25 I guess I just didn't

2758
01:36:40,910 --> 01:36:42,830
understand why these scenes were so

2759
01:36:42,830 --> 01:36:45,080
important I mean I love atmosphere you

2760
01:36:45,080 --> 01:36:46,910
see me praise movies like Kiki that have

2761
01:36:46,910 --> 01:36:48,470
very little going on but they're just so

2762
01:36:48,470 --> 01:36:50,210
likeable and they have such a world to

2763
01:36:50,210 --> 01:36:52,010
explore that yeah I absolutely love it

2764
01:36:52,010 --> 01:36:53,990
with this one though maybe because the

2765
01:36:53,990 --> 01:36:56,690
style is so simple you don't really feel

2766
01:36:56,690 --> 01:36:58,820
like you can get sucked in as much at

2767
01:36:58,820 --> 01:37:00,590
least not enough if you're going to work

2768
01:37:00,590 --> 01:37:03,170
with a very loose story the style itself

2769
01:37:03,170 --> 01:37:05,090
I'm gonna be very honest I was kind of

2770
01:37:05,090 --> 01:37:07,100
expecting a little bit more with for

2771
01:37:07,100 --> 01:37:08,660
example there's a scene where she really

2772
01:37:08,660 --> 01:37:10,670
gets her feelings hurt and she runs out

2773
01:37:10,670 --> 01:37:12,770
of the palace and all the Sun everything

2774
01:37:12,770 --> 01:37:14,950
goes really sketchy and it just looks

2775
01:37:14,950 --> 01:37:17,330
unbelievable this has inspired an

2776
01:37:17,330 --> 01:37:19,070
animation style that actually works

2777
01:37:19,070 --> 01:37:20,840
around the emotions of the character

2778
01:37:20,840 --> 01:37:23,330
holy smokes this is ingenious maybe the

2779
01:37:23,330 --> 01:37:24,590
more confident she feels the more

2780
01:37:24,590 --> 01:37:26,090
together and straight the lines will be

2781
01:37:26,090 --> 01:37:27,800
or the more she's falling apart the more

2782
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:29,600
the animation will look more rugged and

2783
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:31,850
sketchy and yeah holy smokes this is

2784
01:37:31,850 --> 01:37:33,950
almost like a totally new way to do

2785
01:37:33,950 --> 01:37:35,060
animation it could actually

2786
01:37:35,060 --> 01:37:37,370
revolutionize some things but that scene

2787
01:37:37,370 --> 01:37:39,530
where she runs out is literally only one

2788
01:37:39,530 --> 01:37:41,540
scene and it's at the most a minute long

2789
01:37:41,540 --> 01:37:43,520
why couldn't they do that throughout the

2790
01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:45,140
majority of the film I mean I know it

2791
01:37:45,140 --> 01:37:46,340
probably will cost a little bit more

2792
01:37:46,340 --> 01:37:48,320
money but it's already so simple anyway

2793
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:50,390
why not go all the way with it but for

2794
01:37:50,390 --> 01:37:52,040
the most part it just sort of stays in

2795
01:37:52,040 --> 01:37:54,170
this one style and that's it what a

2796
01:37:54,170 --> 01:37:56,750
shame what a missed opportunity so die

2797
01:37:56,750 --> 01:37:58,400
just like the film I don't know if I can

2798
01:37:58,400 --> 01:38:00,830
say that I mean it was still so engaging

2799
01:38:00,830 --> 01:38:03,420
to watch and yeah was slow-moving but

2800
01:38:03,420 --> 01:38:04,830
still want to know where it was going

2801
01:38:04,830 --> 01:38:06,360
there are still a lot of scenes I have a

2802
01:38:06,360 --> 01:38:08,640
lot of imagination and sort of play with

2803
01:38:08,640 --> 01:38:10,260
tone a little bit almost like something

2804
01:38:10,260 --> 01:38:12,090
out of a dream but I don't know if I can

2805
01:38:12,090 --> 01:38:13,949
get behind it like a lot of other studio

2806
01:38:13,949 --> 01:38:15,929
ghibli's works I think I saw more

2807
01:38:15,929 --> 01:38:17,940
possibility that was tapped upon than

2808
01:38:17,940 --> 01:38:20,340
fully explored which isn't totally bad I

2809
01:38:20,340 --> 01:38:22,140
mean I'm glad something new was done

2810
01:38:22,140 --> 01:38:23,670
here I just wish you could have gone all

2811
01:38:23,670 --> 01:38:26,040
the way with it so again kind of a mixed

2812
01:38:26,040 --> 01:38:27,960
review but I would still lean towards

2813
01:38:27,960 --> 01:38:30,270
that is worth checking out because hey

2814
01:38:30,270 --> 01:38:32,250
it is still great artistry and it is

2815
01:38:32,250 --> 01:38:33,600
still a story that want to know by the

2816
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:35,880
end what was going to happen take that

2817
01:38:35,880 --> 01:38:37,020
for what you will and decide for

2818
01:38:37,020 --> 01:38:38,550
yourself

2819
01:38:38,550 --> 01:38:42,390
[Music]

2820
01:38:42,390 --> 01:38:53,030
you

2821
01:38:53,030 --> 01:38:56,000
you
