24
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:46,820

27
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,759
introduce you to Jake who just joined

28
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,950
the team a lot of questions in the

29
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,020
comments about what's he doing and what

30
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,080

31
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,650

is that you're that we're doing together

35
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,320
now that's a good question

36
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,320
I feel like maybe we should go outside

37
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:26,440
what do you think of it right

38
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,680
so the company the beam the app we shut

39
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,210
down with Kenan bought the company but

40
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:32,680
the company is something much more than

41
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,530
just that act and now we're building out

42
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:38,620
like a media wing to that company and

43
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:41,470
that's where Jake referred so I was in

44
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,850
Los Angeles lived there for a year and a

45
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:45,370
half moved from New York to there and it

46
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:49,450
was uh it wasn't for me it just wasn't

47
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:51,390
my I wasn't my thing so when you know

48
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:53,770
Casey came Colin was like hey we're

49
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:55,090

50
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:57,280
you about it of again of course so I

51
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,020
moved out here last week got an

52
00:02:59,020 --> 00:02:59,700
apartment

53
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:05,410
and yes okay let me break down for you

54
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:07,660
exactly what exactly one is we're trying

55
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:20,230
to do okay trying to save time not being

56
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:22,690
that the company here at the middle and

57
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:26,800
the company is what may be me app when

58
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,830
CNN bought being the company we shut

59
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:32,410
down being the app because it wasn't

60
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:34,390
doing very well so what there's a tech

61
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,760
game intellectual property thankful

62
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,880
resources no zu s oh and all the other

63
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,250
company resources so even though the app

64
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,410
is dead but even though the app is dead

65
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:45,700
the company itself is still very

66
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,770
valuable so you think it's gonna be

67
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:51,760
legible say that so now being that

68
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,620
company in addition to being a tech team

69
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,180
with intellectual property in all kinds

70
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,010
of resources we're not building a media

71
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:58,930
arm to the company it's going to have

72
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,910
shows and we're going to have our own

73
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:03,160
YouTube channel and we're going to have

74
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:07,510
other stuff and this this over here this

75
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:10,900
is where Jake fits in the meet on the on

76
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:14,020
the media stuff it is big and the last

77
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:19,090
and the last important thing is use one

78
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:22,300
of my valuable sticker my channel and my

79
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:26,050
channel these these sort of live in

80
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:29,260
their own bubble over here and this is

81
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,760
important because I'm still going to be

82
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,620
doing blogs and shows like this Nick

83
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,720

84
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,580
our channels this is what we're trying

85
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,700
to build together and this is

86
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:42,000
this is still ours I hope that makes

87
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,480
sense
