1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:04,770
look at that I'm pretty brutal sometimes

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:06,089
sometimes I don't even know my own

3
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:06,690
strength

4
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:08,490
last time I showed you guys what it

5
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,670
sounded like to be inside of me now I'm

6
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,349
gonna show you guys what it sounds like

7
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:15,660
to get punched by me cuz I've been

8
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,190
googling myself a little bit recently

9
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,810
and I noticed that a lot of people are

10
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,109
curious how hard can I dubs punch it's

11
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:24,210
very popular search result it's just a

12
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,400
simple lapel mic but the amount of wind

13
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,769
that passes by this is how hard I can

14
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:31,080
punch you ready I gotta get in my

15
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:36,360
fighting stance do you hear it do you

16
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,670
hear it hopefully you guys heard that I

17
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:40,110
really don't know my own strength

18
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:43,440
okay so for this episode of idubbbz

19
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,100
complains I'm taking issue with what I

20
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:52,649
like to call the joke police the joke

21
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:56,100
police are a group of people whether

22
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,579
they're on the right or the left who

23
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:02,489
think that they know what a joke is no

24
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:04,559
not a joke to me if it's not a joke to

25
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,960
me guess what it ain't a joke as the

26
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,960
famous been Shakira once said ah jokes

27
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,030
don't care about your feelings these

28
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:12,930
were not jokes

29
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:15,210
these were statements is literally a

30
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:17,520
statement there is no joke I don't one

31
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,110
thing that I tend to hear a lot of is

32
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,229
it's just the statement I don't think we

33
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:24,840
should act like every joke is some has

34
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,000
to be some sort of knock-knock joke

35
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,729
what's brown white and red all over I

36
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:31,770
don't know I don't fucking know cuz it's

37
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,990
not funny I don't want to try another

38
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:35,700
thing we have to watch out for is saying

39
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,340
things like this is sick man this is

40
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,310
sick disgusting stuff it's not even

41
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,399
funny it's just disgusting I didn't find

42
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,159
that humorous it's just simply repulsive

43
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:50,070
now if that's your genuine reaction to

44
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,509
something that's fine that's your

45
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:53,759
reaction but if you're a critic a writer

46
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,460
someone who has to like form valued

47
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,930
opinions that people want to share

48
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,969
online then you need to put a little bit

49
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:02,159
more effort into your critiques

50
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,780
I'd really quickly like to share

51
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,430
something that I found the other day

52
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,530
it's really disgusting it was uh this

53
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:10,560
was said at a comedy club I don't know

54
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,780
how he got away with it by a guy who got

55
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,540
he got outed for some sort of sexual

56
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,670
misconduct about a year ago he said

57
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:22,060
coming is a need I need to come the

58
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:24,459
first time I came I was 12 and I haven't

59
00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:26,680
skipped a day since is that not the most

60
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,690
disgusting unfunny shit you've ever

61
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,540
heard like uh it's it's repulsive there

62
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,670
where's the punchline I've never skipped

63
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:36,069
a day since okay like we need to hear

64
00:02:36,069 --> 00:02:38,260
that like we need to hear about your cum

65
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:41,170
that's fucking disgusting of course that

66
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:43,150
was just sarcasm I was reading a random

67
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:46,090
bit out of a large segment of Louie CK

68
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:48,790
stand up if you're a fucking prude with

69
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:50,709
a stick up your ass the whole time you

70
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:53,140
can make any you can suck the fun in the

71
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,390
comedy out of anything and I think

72
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:57,160
people in general need to realize that

73
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,560
jokes come in so many different forms

74
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,290
funny cuz true funny because you made a

75
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:04,480
funny face funny because I'm a bit

76
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,670
depraved funny because you farted funny

77
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,560
because I want to laugh because I'm in a

78
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,440
good mood funny because I wrote it at

79
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,870
1:00 a.m. and I somehow think that

80
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,940
everything I say at 1:00 a.m. is a whole

81
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,489
lot funnier than it is at 2:00 p.m. the

82
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:20,290
next day when I'm relooking at it

83
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,780
there's some shows out there like Big

84
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:26,170
Bang Theory that cast a very large net

85
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:28,660
and then you got something like Rick and

86
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,660
Morty and they cast a slightly smaller

87
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:34,269
net but it still Nets a lot of people

88
00:03:34,269 --> 00:03:35,739
you just have to have a slightly higher

89
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:38,470
IQ to understand the humor and then an

90
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,299
even smaller net is cast

91
00:03:40,299 --> 00:03:42,850
if you're writing jokes for a group of

92
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:46,150
spastic Twitter users who find all sorts

93
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:48,400
of deplorable things funny and you

94
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,019
yourself are not a comedian

95
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:52,120
I've been on Twitter for the past seven

96
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,680
or so years and what you have to

97
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,780
understand about Twitter is that people

98
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:58,359
try to be funny because what else are

99
00:03:58,359 --> 00:04:00,730
you going to do a lot of people in this

100
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:03,700
pursuits to be funny come up with the

101
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,440
weirdest shit there's a section of

102
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,359
Twitter called weird Twitter people will

103
00:04:07,359 --> 00:04:09,640
put out tweets that for some people

104
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,560
would be arguably jokes one of the

105
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,480
accounts that I follow that I find very

106
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,109
funny is dead got my dick caught up in a

107
00:04:17,109 --> 00:04:18,760
tree branch now I'm tossing a football

108
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,700
up there to dislodge the darn thing I

109
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,789
find this one particularly funny mainly

110
00:04:24,789 --> 00:04:26,830
for the the darn thing

111
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:29,199
referring to his dick as like a darn

112
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,870
thing is funny yuck

113
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,580
I wouldn't want to meet this guy in real

114
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,500
life there's a lot of tweets here about

115
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,460
cum I want to reiterate that this video

116
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:42,430
is about critiquing the joke police and

117
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,750
with that said I want to move on in

118
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,479
these James Gunn tweets James Gunn he

119
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,849
directed guardians of the galaxy he got

120
00:04:48,849 --> 00:04:51,759
fired from Disney I don't really fucking

121
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,310
care he can get fired this first tweet

122
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,810
that we're gonna look at I find the

123
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:57,789
funniest by far out of all of them and

124
00:04:57,789 --> 00:05:00,099
coincidentally it seems to be the most

125
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:02,650
cited tweet when any of these joke

126
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,090
police are actually talking about the

127
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:06,729
subject I'm doing a big Hollywood film

128
00:05:06,729 --> 00:05:09,099
adaptation of the giving tree' with a

129
00:05:09,099 --> 00:05:11,830
happy ending the tree grows back and

130
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:14,259
gives the kid a blow job if you think

131
00:05:14,259 --> 00:05:16,599
this is anything other than a joke you

132
00:05:16,599 --> 00:05:19,479
know with a setup the punchline the

133
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:21,250
misdirection all that if you think it's

134
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,590
anything other than a joke then you are

135
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,659
either the dumbest person on the planet

136
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:28,240
or you're intentionally being ignorant

137
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,690
so that you could further some agenda

138
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:32,830
three-year-old was peeing on my head

139
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:35,469
they've highlighted that you see the

140
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:38,319
person who found this tweet actually has

141
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:40,120
to have a dirtier mind than the person

142
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,159
who made the tweet because the person

143
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:43,630
who made the tweet is making a

144
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:46,270
water-pressure joke the person who found

145
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:48,370
the tweet and highlighted this said

146
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:50,770
there's something innately sexual about

147
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:52,750
a child urinating on someone's head

148
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:56,379
there's something sexual about that no

149
00:05:56,379 --> 00:05:59,110
no do you have a child did you teach

150
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:01,150
your child how to pee in the toilet or

151
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:03,310
poop in the toilet properly I'm sure it

152
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:05,949
was a bit of messy job was it sexual

153
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:08,740
between you and your child what well if

154
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:11,889

156
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,080
to me the boys are back in town how I

157
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,199
asked you how is it fucking possible

158
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:23,319
that someone says that is evidence of

159
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:26,710
pedophilia no no in it's not just that

160
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:29,409
dude it's that one and the one about the

161
00:06:29,409 --> 00:06:32,080
giving tree' and it's the one about the

162
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,000
three-year-old peeing on his head which

163
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,339
was a wolf water pressure joke it's all

164
00:06:36,339 --> 00:06:39,080
of them together connect the dots man

165
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,259
are you stupid hey this shit we need

166
00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:45,650
internet and website historians people

167
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:48,439
who keep track of how Twitter works how

168
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:50,360
it's worked in the past how people use

169
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,159
the website the first thing we're going

170
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,840
to look at are these two tweets that

171
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,990
have RT in front of the tweet the RT

172
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:00,080
stands for retweets and how retweets

173
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,020
worked back in 2009 which is when both

174
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,210
these tweets were made it wouldn't copy

175
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:07,280
the person's exact tweet or it would be

176
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,560
a quote tweet and it would have RT in

177
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,180
front of it so you know that it was a

178
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,370
retweet of the person then after

179
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,960
mentioned I don't know if that's correct

180
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,360
were use of affirmations probably so

181
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,120
when he said I like it when boys touch

182
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,909
me my silly plays what he's doing is

183
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:24,710
he's playing a prank on what I assume

184
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,960
would be his friend this is a tweet that

185
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,300
my friend made Hey look at it pranked

186
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,159
same thing with this one down here I

187
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,949
actually saw comments of people saying

188
00:07:33,949 --> 00:07:37,039
oh my god you see that part he mentioned

189
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,629
something about NAMBLA do you know what

190
00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:40,310
that shit is deaf man boy love

191
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:43,099
association holy crap just dying deep

192
00:07:43,099 --> 00:07:46,190
it's like no the point is that he's

193
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:48,680
making it look like this other person is

194
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,539
a member of NAMBLA the reason this whole

195
00:07:50,539 --> 00:07:52,699
retweet prank thing sort of stood out to

196
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:55,430
me is i remembered that i pulled pranks

197
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:58,129
like this on twitter during that era if

198
00:07:58,129 --> 00:08:01,009
you liked a video on youtube it would

199
00:08:01,009 --> 00:08:03,680
send a tweet out saying i liked a video

200
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,199
from so-and-so and put the title there

201
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:07,879
and the link so i would tweet out

202
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:10,219
something like I like the YouTube video

203
00:08:10,219 --> 00:08:13,729
from at the finebros kids react guy

204
00:08:13,729 --> 00:08:16,699
fucks hotpokket now of course the

205
00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:18,710
finebros never had a kids react where

206
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:20,779
kids watched a video of a guy fucking a

207
00:08:20,779 --> 00:08:22,550
hotpocket that was a prank

208
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:25,250
and it was meant to surprise people who

209
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,349
were in my feed maybe i got attention

210
00:08:27,349 --> 00:08:29,659
from the finebros the the point is

211
00:08:29,659 --> 00:08:30,740
you're trying to grow your Twitter

212
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,599
you're trying to get attention it didn't

213
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:33,800
really work out for me

214
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,570
you know I didn't you know these tweets

215
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:38,089
really weren't bangers so when you see a

216
00:08:38,089 --> 00:08:40,459
tweet like this what era was that

217
00:08:40,459 --> 00:08:42,890
tweeted in was this a popular thing to

218
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:45,290
do during this time you know a lot of

219
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:47,569

220
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:49,520
weird you might be too young to even

221
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,240
know that that was a thing it's Bo

222
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,209
my mind to say like kids you might be

223
00:08:55,209 --> 00:08:57,580
too young to know about the guy fucking

224
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,440
the hot pocket and you might be a little

225
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,940
bit older if you remember the guy who is

226
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,040
fucking the McChicken right the other

227
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,270
thing I'd like to bring some attention

228
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:05,950
to that people seem to be so

229
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:08,860
passionately ignoring are these hashtags

230
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,170
sad children's books

231
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:14,589
hashtag unromantic movies if you have no

232
00:09:14,589 --> 00:09:16,750

233
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,420

241
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,110
doing the same thing

242
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:37,000
