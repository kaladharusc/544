1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,410
hey guys what's up sweet deadlocks

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:03,929
welcome back to another video today is

3
00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:06,210
actually a very interesting and a very

4
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:09,840
different video something that I haven't

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,340
really talked about at all throughout my

6
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:19,230
youtube career and the past the past few

7
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,039
years have been very I'm going to say

8
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,840
about two years past two years have been

9
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:30,810
very odd on on this channel as you know

10
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:33,480
we spent a lot of our early YouTube

11
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,510
career doing Minecraft videos and that's

12
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,790
basically where the majority of my

13
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:42,180
subscribers came from is from Minecraft

14
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,539
and minecraft videos from 2012 to

15
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:50,969
basically 2015 and as a lot of you have

16
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:53,520
noticed a lot of that has changed my

17
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,070
channel is nowhere near of minecraft

18
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:00,180
channel and I changed that for multiple

19
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,539
reasons but I feel like you know I have

20
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:04,920
not been in Minecraft channel for a long

21
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,500
time and I've been thinking about a lot

22
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,409
about it lately I'm gonna be honest

23
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:13,320
whether that was the smartest move or

24
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,070
not and I I still feel like that was the

25
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:20,759
smartest move I was honestly kind of

26
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:23,250
getting sick of the game I was not happy

27
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,729
recording it and it was something that

28
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:29,040
kind of got old to me and I wanted to

29
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,950
start working face to face with a camera

30
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,140
which I've had to do these past couple

31
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,119
years which has been very exciting and

32
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:39,570
very fun but let's get into it this is

33
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:43,619
the story of why I left the Minecraft

34
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:45,479
community and left making minecraft

35
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:49,470
videos and all that stuff I'm not going

36
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,720
to be naming any names on this videos

37
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,799
they're gonna be all fake names and I

38
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:00,360
just basically want to explain why you

39
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,570
know maybe it was so abrupt was so fast

40
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:06,420
of a change on this channel which the

41
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,750
change has been honestly a blessing I've

42
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,060
gained so many new subscribers so many

43
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,250
new viewers

44
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:16,070
you know enjoy my videos that I do even

45
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:19,040
to this day you know thank you guys all

46
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,920
the new everybody but for those of you

47
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,300
didn't know like I just said I used to

48
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,750
be a Minecraft youtuber and I've you

49
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:31,130
know game over probably you know a 2

50
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:36,470
million subscribers from Minecraft and a

51
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:40,220
lot of use from minecraft and the reason

52
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:44,200
why I left the Minecraft community

53
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,000
there's just so many reasons and I want

54
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,209
to explain it just because I don't want

55
00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:52,850
to feel like I I don't want to blame

56
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:55,280
anybody but I don't want to feel like I

57
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,550
I don't want to feel like I'm blamed by

58
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:01,489
people old fans old people who used to

59
00:03:01,489 --> 00:03:03,530
know who I was

60
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:06,350
companies brands whatever I don't want

61
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:08,060
them to think like the oldest kid just

62
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:11,200
like went fucking straight out you know

63
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,290
good kid to what what is even now

64
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:19,519
reactions to weird cursing stuff all

65
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,040
this stuff no and to all the people who

66
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,420
used to say I was kid friendly I was

67
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,790
never ever kid friendly that's one thing

68
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,380
I want to talk about so in the beginning

69
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:30,080
I did minecraft with a bunch of people

70
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,650
I've met so much so many so many awesome

71
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,989
people throughout you know my whole

72
00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:42,140
youtube career so many people who I you

73
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,030
know who are my friends who are my

74
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,350
friends and who I thought were my

75
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:48,290
friends now this happens throughout all

76
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:50,150
communities on YouTube but people who

77
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:52,160
are fake people who've used you and

78
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,350
people who only talk to you and only who

79
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:57,079
only want to be your friend just because

80
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:58,820
you have subscribers just because you're

81
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:02,239
getting views which in my opinion is you

82
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,450
know a big thing in the Minecraft

83
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:08,299
community always has been that people

84
00:04:08,299 --> 00:04:11,959
get on their knees and I'm just gonna

85
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:14,660
say there they get on their knees when

86
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,400
you have subscribers when you have

87
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,799
viewers and they act like you know they

88
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:20,269
can be your best friend in the whole

89
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:22,400
entire world that you know they can

90
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,620
they're gonna they're gonna talk to you

91
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,300
they're gonna be in any video you can

92
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:26,730
they can

93
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:28,920
help out no matter what you know no

94
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,590
matter what bro I got you and these are

95
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:34,590
normally this happened to me this

96
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:36,480
happened a lot of people I'd known a lot

97
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,150
of YouTube or minecraft youtubers like I

98
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:41,280
said including myself where there's a

99
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,250
bunch of youtubers at the time who you

100
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,600
know we're very small and you know

101
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,770
they're really cool people they're

102
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:52,980
starting to grow and you know there's

103
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,810
group recordings we added these people

104
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:57,540
to group recordings and you know we were

105
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,330
friendly with them and I was friendly

106
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,220
with a bunch of people a lot of people

107
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:05,850
in the Minecraft community and you know

108
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:10,410
it's you know once once the tables turn

109
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:14,070
it's it's kind of not the same I bring

110
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:19,080
this up just because you know all these

111
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,110
people who I thought were my friends end

112
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:24,240
up at the end when you have nobody to

113
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,490
record with and you know your channels

114
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:29,490
not doing that well anymore you know

115
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:31,440
they won't even message you back they

116
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,690
won't even message you back it doesn't

117
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:36,120
happen and this happened to me this

118
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,800
happened to a lot of people I've heard

119
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,920
this complaint from a lot of people and

120
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,350
when these people become big and your

121
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:45,060
own channel is starting to not do as

122
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,120
well because now they're moving on to

123
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,070
recording with a bunch of bigger people

124
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:52,050
and you're just sold news they kind of

125
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,520
just forget who you are and they throw

126
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,670
you away as a quote-unquote friend if

127
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:59,820
you ever were their friend I don't know

128
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:03,420
I don't know but what I do know is that

129
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,160
was one of the biggest reasons why I

130
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,720
left the Minecraft community because a

131
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,900
lot of it were a bunch of people who

132
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:13,650
were a small youtuber or starting to

133
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:16,320
grow youtuber who sucked up to a bunch

134
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,640
of big youtubers and then when they

135
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,970
became big their ego grew and they

136
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:23,220
decided to be the biggest assholes and

137
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,540
forget about the people who helped them

138
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,790
to begin with that's the biggest issue

139
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,260
with the Minecraft community there's

140
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,930
multiple there's so many in the

141
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:33,150
Minecraft community so many minecraft

142
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:36,780
youtubers whose egos like holy shit calm

143
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,810
down you record Minecraft videos there's

144
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:40,320
nothing

145
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,230
impressive at all in that field sure you

146
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:45,090
can use you're getting money everybody

147
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:47,850
did everybody did there's a list of

148
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:50,190
minecraft youtubers probably hundreds of

149
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:53,130
minecraft youtubers who have made close

150
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:55,860
to a million dollars just by recording

151
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,200
Minecraft and a lot of better didn't

152
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,230
even edit their videos including myself

153
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:03,570
I'm not gonna lie well everybody in the

154
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:05,070
Minecraft community they made too much

155
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,660
money made more money than they should

156
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,940
have more money than they frickin should

157
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,400
of by videos that weren't even edited

158
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,200
just basically cut the beginning to

159
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,330
where it says hey and at the end we're

160
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:17,460
sissy yeah and just slap an intro outro

161
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:20,760
you done render it and upload it too

162
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:24,560
many people made so much money off of

163
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,030
something that was so silly and grew a

164
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:31,740
big giant ego another reason why I left

165
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,290
the Minecraft community that was really

166
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:37,980
my biggest one is that people who I

167
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,050
thought were my friends ended up not

168
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:44,550
really being my friends a lot of it

169
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:47,450
ended up being turning into business I

170
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:50,220
mean there's no snows nothing wrong with

171
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,900
business nothing wrong with turning your

172
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:56,190
career a YouTube channel into business

173
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:59,160
companies there's nothing wrong with

174
00:07:59,160 --> 00:07:59,940
that at all

175
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:04,370
but one thing I did notice with that is

176
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:09,600
when when things turn into more of a

177
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:14,130
business and less of a hobby you get

178
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:16,710
people treating it like a business and

179
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:22,650
it it turns from you know a bunch of

180
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:25,410
guys having fun and their friends and

181
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:27,120
they're recording having fun turning

182
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,720
into what are we gonna do to record to

183
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,610
benefit our channels what are we going

184
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:33,900
to do to record that's going to benefit

185
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:37,229
me was it gonna benefit you know are we

186
00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:39,510
going to do trending topics are gonna do

187
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:42,390
what's viral because you know we need to

188
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:45,120
rake in the views to better our business

189
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,800
to better our channel to get them

190
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,890
YouTube money people are so focused on

191
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:52,230
that in the minecraft community and the

192
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:53,940
thing is it's people are so focused on

193
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:54,150
that

194
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:56,130
no matter what community you're in even

195
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:59,130
now I mean right now YouTube is based

196
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:02,880
off trends and that's one thing is that

197
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,810
that is true

198
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,490
YouTube is fully a hundred percent

199
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:08,760
trends and you either have a viral video

200
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,290
if you're doing what's trending right

201
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:12,930
now or you don't think you don't if you

202
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:14,370
don't do what's trending videos probably

203
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:17,490
not going to do that good which is you

204
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,740
know everyday YouTube stuff that's

205
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:24,510
alright but when people like bash you

206
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:27,270
and people treat you odd just because

207
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:28,970
you don't want to act like a businessman

208
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:31,230
and you just want to be a normal dude

209
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:34,560
who you know wants to do YouTube you

210
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,180

211

212
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,600
you want to do you still want to do good

213
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,450
videos you want to viral videos but you

214
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:49,620
don't want to you know you don't want to

215
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:53,220
talk about business 24/7 you don't want

216
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:56,940
to be you know you don't want to be a

217
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:59,100
business man you don't want to be the

218
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,740
biggest out there just because you just

219
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,110

223
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:19,590
you don't want to change you don't want

224
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:21,720
to change you just want to record videos

225
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,210
like you always have some people don't

226
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:27,780
understand that and some people treat

227
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,880
you I the treat you differently say

228
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:35,820
you're gonna fail and I've had I've had

229
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:39,900
people tell me I'm gonna my YouTube

230
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:43,500
channel is gonna fail and that if you

231
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,180
know you don't do things a certain way

232
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:48,660
if you don't act a certain way if you

233
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,370
don't treat your YouTube channel a

234
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:53,130
certain way business-wise you're just

235
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:55,200
gonna crash and fail and you know people

236
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,610
are gonna replace you which you know

237
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:59,940
honestly you know is true but hard to

238
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:02,970
believe it's true and not true true in

239
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:04,260
fact someone's always going to replace

240
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,460
you someone's always going to do better

241
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,780
than you someone's always going to blow

242
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:07,540
up

243
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:12,209
but you can still be you you can still

244
00:11:12,209 --> 00:11:15,610
do anything you can on YouTube and you

245
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:17,829
can still blow up I've done that the

246
00:11:17,829 --> 00:11:20,920
past year I've had bad months where ever

247
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,740
I've only gained a million views for the

248
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,850
month and I have months where I've

249
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,040
gained close to 10 million views for the

250
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,600
whole month and I've had months where

251
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,130
I've lost subscribers I have months

252
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:35,620
where I've gained tens of thousands of

253
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:39,040
subscribers the past year just how

254
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:43,389
YouTube works and that's just me working

255
00:11:43,389 --> 00:11:47,319
from home put your people in the

256
00:11:47,319 --> 00:11:49,930
Minecraft community they think they're

257
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:55,089
hotshot CEOs but you don't have to be

258
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:56,920
you don't have to be and I refuse to be

259
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:04,149
that and I've had multiple people treat

260
00:12:04,149 --> 00:12:06,100
me differently just because I don't want

261
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,430
to be a hotshot CEO I just want to be a

262
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:11,110
content creator for my own channel I

263
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:15,430
want to I want to have my own fans and I

264
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:18,819
want to be the best for my my own fans I

265
00:12:18,819 --> 00:12:20,560
want to grow

266
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,630
I would love to grow with other

267
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:26,319
youtubers but there's always a string

268
00:12:26,319 --> 00:12:28,269
attached to that in the minecraft

269
00:12:28,269 --> 00:12:34,990
community and I didn't want to be a part

270
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:38,829
of that it turned me off so bad the few

271
00:12:38,829 --> 00:12:40,180
things I've talked about when it comes

272
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:42,550
to people acting like their Big Shot

273
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:48,940
CEOs when it comes to people changing

274
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,920
when it comes to people just throwing

275
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,930
you away thinking that you know you're

276
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:58,420
their friend and just just a lot just a

277
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,160
lot of that in the Minecraft community

278
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,569
it's stressful it was very stressful and

279
00:13:03,569 --> 00:13:06,370
there's a bunch of people who left a lot

280
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:08,259
of people who some people who left the

281
00:13:08,259 --> 00:13:12,720
Minecraft community for that reason and

282
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,319
you know some people people will never

283
00:13:17,319 --> 00:13:19,089
agree everyone has their opinion

284
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:21,330
everyone has their way of doing things

285
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:28,050
and just being a part of a community

286
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:33,930
that is surrounded by so much fake so

287
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:38,279
much fake is just was really hard for me

288
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:43,769
to do just because I just felt like all

289
00:13:43,769 --> 00:13:45,480
the people who I thought were my friends

290
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,240
were really my friends and couldn't give

291
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,089
a shit about me

292
00:13:51,089 --> 00:13:53,490
the rest of the other you know people I

293
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:56,010
thought I knew who were my friends they

294
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:59,880
just basically treated me like a piece

295
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,329
of chess where they thought they could

296
00:14:03,329 --> 00:14:06,750
just put strings on me and control my

297
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,930
every single move control what I do on

298
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:13,410
my own YouTube channel and I just don't

299
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:18,269
roll with that I never did I I'm super

300
00:14:18,269 --> 00:14:23,550
proud of myself for you know leaving the

301
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,320
Minecraft community and not doing

302
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:29,910
minecraft videos and I apologize for all

303
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:33,480
the fans who vibe I upset but leaving

304
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:39,390
the Minecraft community and other than

305
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:44,160
that I I really don't want to upset

306
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,579
those fans a lot of you do know I made a

307
00:14:47,579 --> 00:14:51,149
channel a little while ago has like 11k

308
00:14:51,149 --> 00:14:54,360
subscribers where I was doing Minecraft

309
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,430
and roblox I just upload a video on that

310
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:58,470
channel saying that I'm just gonna be

311
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:59,490
doing roblox

312
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:02,370
just because I just I don't like

313
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:05,010
recording minecraft anymore but I roblox

314
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:07,620
was new to me and roblox is still new to

315
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,390
me and I'm finding it really fun to be

316
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:14,040
honest and creative but when it comes to

317
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,399
that I have different plans maybe for

318
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:18,149
that channel

319
00:15:18,149 --> 00:15:20,790
maybe switching that channel over to my

320
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:23,190
deluxe vs. gaming channel but that's

321
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:26,640
that's for a later video I've always

322
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,050
wanted to talk about this and kind of

323
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:32,880
get it off my chest just because it's

324
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,829
been

325
00:15:34,829 --> 00:15:39,059
weird how that this channel can some

326
00:15:39,059 --> 00:15:41,399
people can call me a Minecraft youtuber

327
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,829
and some people can call me a reaction

328
00:15:43,829 --> 00:15:45,839
channel I'd rather be called a reaction

329
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,679
channel than a Minecraft youtuber just

330
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:51,989
because that ship has sailed a long time

331
00:15:51,989 --> 00:15:55,049
ago and again I apologize to all the

332
00:15:55,049 --> 00:15:56,970
people who I've upset leaving the

333
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:04,170
Minecraft community and I'm super proud

334
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:04,769
of myself

335
00:16:04,769 --> 00:16:07,739
this past year the good and the bad

336
00:16:07,739 --> 00:16:09,929
months still had some really awesome

337
00:16:09,929 --> 00:16:13,410
months and I still am planning to have

338
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:15,509
some pretty amazing awesome months for

339
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:18,499
the future thank you guys so much but

340
00:16:18,499 --> 00:16:21,089
gotta end of the video my name is dead

341
00:16:21,089 --> 00:16:23,000
lux and as always peace out
