[Music]

61
00:04:26,830 --> 00:05:06,190
oh okay impasse 169 nothing can escape

62
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:09,360
the deadly aim of the beer hunter

63
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,710
because if you were good boy you would

64
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:13,539
have set that up a long time ago and

65
00:05:13,539 --> 00:05:17,080
then then you didn't interact with six

66
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:27,159
beers and they're tall boys all right so

67
00:05:27,159 --> 00:05:28,810
if I hit it dead center should knock

68
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:31,330
them all over right in theory or no

69
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:34,180
actually you have to hit it not dead

70
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:37,659
center but in the middle of the second

71
00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:39,250
and third rows it's like Christmas

72
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:46,060
forever any bar yeah you thought I left

73
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:55,449
I did recycled that no good thing I have

74
00:05:55,449 --> 00:06:05,080
superpowers

75
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,900
I'm not afraid of you as more water

76
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:15,919
eater

77
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,220
and you can do it captain spirit

78
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:42,570
take the Beast

79
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:48,910
and the Beast was stunned it's getting

80
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:55,780
kind of rusty yes did it Joe except for

81
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,370
the superhero team

82
00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:03,309
[Music]

83
00:07:03,309 --> 00:07:05,589
so go play the Chris nah man isn't weird

84
00:07:05,589 --> 00:07:13,379
of it so the game is only two hours long

85
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:16,719
less than two hours but it's a free game

86
00:07:16,719 --> 00:07:20,109
it's a prologue to life is strange - I

87
00:07:20,109 --> 00:07:23,499
guess the illusion of branching paths

88
00:07:23,499 --> 00:07:27,609
and actual different outcomes doesn't

89
00:07:27,609 --> 00:07:29,969
isn't strong here no it's completely

90
00:07:29,969 --> 00:07:33,219
linear completely telling a story one

91
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:36,610
way so it's an interactive linear story

92
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:40,269
with minimal gameplay elements and these

93
00:07:40,269 --> 00:07:42,579
aren't normally the kinds of games that

94
00:07:42,579 --> 00:07:46,209
I play but luckily I was into the story

95
00:07:46,209 --> 00:07:47,889
was into the kind of thing of the little

96
00:07:47,889 --> 00:07:50,829
kid kind of going on adventures but now

97
00:07:50,829 --> 00:07:53,319
I love that idea so much that I kind of

98
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:55,389
wish there was more like when we go to

99
00:07:55,389 --> 00:07:56,919
the other planet we've got a gameplay

100
00:07:56,919 --> 00:07:58,899
section we got we're fighting the

101
00:07:58,899 --> 00:08:01,089
Snowman we got a gameplay section and

102
00:08:01,089 --> 00:08:03,759
that's not what this is unfortunately so

103
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,949
I look forward to the day when somebody

104
00:08:05,949 --> 00:08:08,229
actually does that it's a charming

105
00:08:08,229 --> 00:08:11,739
appetizer it's free so it's hard to

106
00:08:11,739 --> 00:08:13,809
complain about you know about two hours

107
00:08:13,809 --> 00:08:16,089
or less than two hours devoid of any

108
00:08:16,089 --> 00:08:19,659
real significant gameplay but it has a

109
00:08:19,659 --> 00:08:22,749
charming story Joe these are not

110
00:08:22,749 --> 00:08:27,459
typically my games at all but you did

111
00:08:27,459 --> 00:08:30,159
sell me on the free part and I kind of

112
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:33,430
wanted to see if anything does change oh

113
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,559
you want to try to go through this

114
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:37,029
little section again and see if it

115
00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:39,819
changes just trying I think all right I

116
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:41,529
think you'll probably always still get

117
00:08:41,529 --> 00:08:43,360
the same ending and you'll just have a

118
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,800
different costume and maybe your dad

119
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,309
will be meaner or nicer but still by the

120
00:08:48,309 --> 00:08:51,339
end the same result one thing that did

121
00:08:51,339 --> 00:08:54,420
piss me off is the code made no sense

122
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,980
this code to get into a cell phone we're

123
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:59,290
not gonna tell you what it is but as far

124
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:01,269
as I know it's not in the game I have no

125
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:04,029
idea how we cheated a little bit yeah a

126
00:09:04,029 --> 00:09:05,139
little bit yeah

127
00:09:05,139 --> 00:09:07,899
yeah we cheat so that that that is not

128
00:09:07,899 --> 00:09:10,029
good game and as much as I want to say

129
00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:11,800
this reminds me of my childhood I can't

130
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,110
anymore because you know you got the bad

131
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:15,059
element in here

132
00:09:15,059 --> 00:09:17,039
and my dad was much different than that

133
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:19,319
oh yeah so no this is not like my

134
00:09:19,319 --> 00:09:23,789
childhood this is I can identify with

135
00:09:23,789 --> 00:09:26,399
Chris playing with toys and and acting

136
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,619
like a superhero and coming up with wild

137
00:09:28,619 --> 00:09:30,779
adventures with his imagination and

138
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,939
that's what I love the most about it all

139
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:34,529
right guys thank you so much for

140
00:09:34,529 --> 00:09:36,599
watching and we will see you on the next

141
