1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:06,660
it's not clickbait I really am ending

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:31,920
the vlog yes

3
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,649
I'm starting a proper daily vlog I'm

4
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:38,540
psyched so this is the first vlog entry

5
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:41,640
but let me start this morning back in

6
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:47,360
New York City yeah I was a I was a

7
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,789
youtuber before I was a vlogger and I

8
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:54,170
was a filmmaker before I was a youtuber

9
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:57,899
I'm not gonna give any of that up it's

10
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:01,109
just this the last whatever 18 months

11
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:13,830
500 600 videos this experiment it's over

12
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:17,780
[Music]

13
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,970
you know what I when I think back to why

14
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:24,119
I started this vlog I spent so much of

15
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:27,299
that time sitting here talking to you

16
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:30,329
about this premise about this idea that

17
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:32,640
I need to challenge myself creatively

18
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,650
and I've gotten lazy on this platform

19
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,509
and it hadn't been posting and by

20
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:38,579
issuing a mandate to post every single

21
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:40,650
day I would challenge myself creatively

22
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,229
in a way I had never done before and

23
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:45,720
that's exactly what happened and I think

24
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,579
for the first year of doing this I felt

25
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:48,840
that fire under my ass

26
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,299
I felt that challenge every single day I

27
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:54,149
woke up every day thinking what can I do

28
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:56,930
today to make the greatest video

29
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:00,119
possible well then you see how famous

30
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:01,689
you are now

31
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:06,479
really you see this oh that's nice

32
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,160
that's nice that's nice

33
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,010
the most famous UPS Meru internet

34
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:15,040
celebrity Marlon man you know what's

35
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,750
gonna happen up here though right it's

36
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:22,720
gonna be Marlon and Casey yeah and I

37
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,370
don't know I can probably like six

38
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:25,900
months ago something like that it

39
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,160
started to get easy

40
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,129
I found a rhythm I found a system for

41
00:02:30,129 --> 00:02:33,280
approaching this daily video that was no

42
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,700
longer a challenge and this vlog I feel

43
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,170
like turned into the one thing that I

44
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:39,579
didn't want it to be when I started

45
00:02:39,579 --> 00:02:41,379
which is just me making a little video

46
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:43,090
about what my day was every single day

47
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:45,239
the creative challenge faded away

48
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:49,000
something easier took its place and then

49
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,099
that easier thing was exasperated by

50
00:02:51,099 --> 00:02:53,530
wild success on YouTube since starting

51
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:55,420
this blog have earned over five million

52
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,370
subscribers I've done over a billion

53
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:00,160
views since starting this vlog and that

54
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,370
success combined with kind of a creative

55
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,340
complacency I think yielded something

56
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,980
that I don't like something I'm not

57
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,500
proud of which is that like I know how

58
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,359
to do this and do it in a way that's

59
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,190
pretty easy and have it make me very

60
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,530
successful on YouTube and make a great

61
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,109
living via Adsense and and grow this

62
00:03:20,109 --> 00:03:23,130
reach but what it hasn't been doing is

63
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:25,540
challenging me it hasn't been the

64
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:28,090
creative fistfight that I want and need

65
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:31,269
every single day and the more I wrestle

66
00:03:31,269 --> 00:03:32,919
with how to find that creative challenge

67
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:35,410
the more I realize I will never find it

68
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:38,139
as long as 16 hours out of my 24 hour

69
00:03:38,139 --> 00:03:40,239
day I'm dedicated to to uploading this

70
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,569
daily video I have to kill this before I

71
00:03:43,569 --> 00:03:47,410
can give birth to what's next

72
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:53,540
[Music]

73
00:03:53,540 --> 00:04:14,020
[Music]

74
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,970
it's like my favorite metaphor which is

75
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,950
like that Tarzan metaphor that I talk

76
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:19,549
about

77
00:04:19,549 --> 00:04:22,400
it's a couldn't be more appropriate this

78
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,520
idea that like life or career my career

79
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,860
is this huge jungle that I'm trying to

80
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,870
navigate my way through and the only way

81
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,550
to get from one side of the jungle to

82
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:32,870
the other the only way to get to where I

83
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:35,510
want to be in my career is by swinging

84
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:38,150
from vine to vine and grabbing onto that

85
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:40,610
next opportunity that next vine to take

86
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:42,650
me closer to where I want to be and the

87
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:45,740
trouble with success is that it makes

88
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:48,200
you very comfortable and look in

89
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,690
September inside of 128 day window I did

90
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,640
a hundred and fifty five million views

91
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,740
and I earned one point 1 million

92
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,900
subscribers that's a kind of YouTube

93
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:00,170
success that is like I could have never

94
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:02,540
imagined when I started and that makes

95
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,310
you very comfortable that kind of

96
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:06,470
success sends me good just keep doing

97
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:07,820
what I'm doing right now and this

98
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:11,090
success will continue but that means

99
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:12,890
holding on to that one vine in the

100
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:14,930
jungle and not reaching for what's next

101
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:18,440
and and the more I thought about like

102
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,419
how am I going to progress my career how

103
00:05:20,419 --> 00:05:22,940
am I going to figure out what how is my

104
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:25,100
career going to evolve how am I going to

105
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,169
figure out what's next in my career the

106
00:05:27,169 --> 00:05:28,880
more I realize I have to first let go of

107
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,100
this vine before I can grab on to what's

108
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,840
next

109
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:53,520
[Music]

110
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,530
and when I think of risk I think of like

111
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:59,220
I think of like my 19 year old self

112
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,870
abandoning my job in Connecticut and

113
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,340
running to New York City with nothing

114
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,080
and taking a big chance on this dream to

115
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,780
become a filmmaker but in success and

116
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:10,690
look I'm 35 years 35 years old and I

117
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:12,910
make a great living doing what I love I

118
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:14,920
think I found some degree of success in

119
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:19,270
my life when you found success risk it's

120
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:21,790
a whole lot different because risk means

121
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:24,010
jeopardizing what you've earned what you

122
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:26,250
have and giving up this vlog is is

123
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:29,350
certainly risk this is a tremendous risk

124
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:33,280
but the thing that this vlog has yielded

125
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,870
is opportunity by reaching almost 5

126
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:40,120
million people a day via this channel

127
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,490
via this it's presented me with just

128
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:45,340
this tidal wave of opportunity and the

129
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,170
more I look around at that opportunity

130
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:48,970
and the more I think of what do I want

131
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:51,280
out of my career do I want to be making

132
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,990
vlogs when I'm 40 years old and the

133
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:55,780
answer is no like a career is always

134
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,730
about progress it's never arriving in

135
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:59,470
one place and staying there I've always

136
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:00,490
approached everything with that

137
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:02,680
mentality certainly when I think of the

138
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,980
long game that is my career this was a

139
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:08,140
big stepping stone but this was not the

140
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,120
finish line and that's a really scary

141
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,320
thing to admit to yourself especially

142
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,820
when my channel is still growing but

143
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,650
that's not enough of a reason to not

144
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:19,810
embrace something new and that's exactly

145
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:22,360
what I'm doing and what I'm doing next

146
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,160
is a whole nother video that I will dive

147
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,950
into and share the intimacy's of with

148
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:29,140
you but it's time to embrace a new

149
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,760
opportunity it's time to push for

150
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,340
something else because the success of

151
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,950
this vlog has not satiated my appetite

152
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:38,260
it's only made me more hungry this is

153
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,330
the most literal example of that

154
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:43,030
platitude I love to share that is with

155
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:45,220
each success comes a bigger more

156
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,380
ambitious goal with the success of this

157
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:50,360
vlog it has only made me hungrier

158
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,129
and I'm acting on that right now by

159
00:07:52,129 --> 00:07:55,430
moving on from this from this blog you

160
00:07:55,430 --> 00:08:07,820
can do it

161
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,290
so what does that mean for this channel

162
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:13,470
well first I'm not giving up YouTube at

163
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:15,930
all I will be uploading I will be

164
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:18,030
uploading regularly I will continue to

165
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,980
pump out videos but different kinds of

166
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,990
videos the kinds of videos that take a

167
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:23,790
little thinking more than a day to

168
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:25,980
produce the kinds of videos that have to

169
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,720
really envelop myself in before I can

170
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:42,659
make thank you for coming along with me

171
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:44,010
on this journey that has been the last

172
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:46,140
year and a half thank you for letting me

173
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,990
share my life and my perspectives and my

174
00:08:48,990 --> 00:09:06,410
ideas with you

175
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:10,470
and that's kind of it stopping is not

176
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:13,170
easy I thought about going to like two

177
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:15,530
episodes a week or three episodes a week

178
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:20,160
but then I realized I can't grab on to

179
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,080
what's next unless I completely let go

180
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,820
of this so the only way to truly move on

181
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:33,900
is just to drop the mic so with that

182
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:34,080
