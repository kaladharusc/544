99
00:06:29,869 --> 00:06:31,999
to stop them

100
00:06:31,999 --> 00:06:34,669
I'll take this first puzzle if you take

101
00:06:34,669 --> 00:06:39,589

right we got to get rid of this thing

166
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,850
that insta kill is the thing so you can

167
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:22,649
hit it for six right away and then

168
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:25,050
whenever an ally is destroyed and give

169
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:49,500
it charge wing threw us back geez again

170
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,970
to a bear which guy number two but the

171
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:56,779
bear doesn't do anything for us right

172
00:11:56,779 --> 00:12:02,970
you just want to see it oh yeah ah no

173
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:06,839
ability lady looks cool I'm in the front

174
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:13,500
just in case now all we need to do is

175
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,139
bring out an archer but we need to make

176
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:18,510
sure the top card is an archer by using

177
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:21,750
her special power make sure the top card

178
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,510
is an archer with a special power then

179
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:29,330
use this to bring the archer out

180
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:35,450
whoa decapitation guys we had a ton of

181
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:38,180
fun with this game over our course with

182
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:40,970
it plenty of really unique battles and

183
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:43,490

184
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:46,600

187
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:54,470
card games it constantly is keeping

188
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:56,390
itself fresh if you really like

189
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:58,430

190
