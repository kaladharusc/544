world this vacation no the reason why we

22
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:41,490
took this vacation it's the same reason

23
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:43,920
why I've taken a break from posting

24
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,300

Airport for the local time is it makes

31
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:13,900
me think of other times in my life when

32
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,150
there are big changes like when I got

33
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:18,730
married or when when Francine was born

34
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:20,230

35
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:23,530
good to see you sir and those inflection

36
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:26,349
points you know in the moment they don't

37
00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:28,030
in the moment they don't feel as

38
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,920
substantive as when you look back at

39
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,750
them and you realize that like those

40
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:35,260
terms are the terms that make your

41
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:39,830
entire life

42
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:50,620

[Music]

51
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:11,700
you know Owen went to college not long

52
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,980
after Francine was born so it really has

53
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:17,040
just been the three of us and and when

54
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,810
you think of your family unit you think

55
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:20,610
of it as like this a movable thing like

56
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,260
families don't change your family is

57
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,990
your family the only time it changes is

58
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:27,330
when someone new comes into your family

59
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:30,000
and we're about to have that happen in

60
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,940
the most like jarring way it could which

61
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:37,140
is by having a little baby come in and

62
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:45,750
change everything

63
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:49,870
so I'm here I'm here in Boston speaking

64
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:52,540

65
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:55,420

68
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:27,970
back in New York and that's a lot

69
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,590
it's exciting that's life like that's

70
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:32,530
what that's what it's all about but we

71
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:34,480
really have been trying to appreciate

72
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,370
what we've had for the last couple of

73
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:38,440
years and appreciate the fact that it's

74
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,050
all about to change and this this little

75
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:43,500
trip is a culmination of that

76
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:51,910
appreciation
