2
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:11,040
37 seconds of Sony logos 69a each other

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,480
awesome the sky found the original

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,580
Jumanji game buried on the beach where

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,109
it was left in the last movie but the

6
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:17,250
people approaching it at the end of the

7
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,779
last movie were speaking French implying

8
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:20,250
it went across the ocean this is still

9
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,570
America so you you say I found something

10
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,160
you gotta check this out you gotta check

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,590
this out cliche board game and play

12
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,990
Spartacus who says this out loud to

13
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:32,250
themselves when presented with a board

14
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,320
game also tons of people played board

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,730
games in 1996 and even now that you what

16
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,050
the hell is exactly going on over there

17
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:41,790
is there a gremlin masturbating to a

18
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,829
sleeping Alex also wouldn't we think

19
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:45,270
about Jumanji is its ability to upgrade

20
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,890
whenever someone shuns it this is

21
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,450
something Jumanji stockholders demanded

22
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,190
during the board game crash of 79 say

23
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,899
what Alex was clearly playing a

24
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:53,340
PlayStation earlier which only plays

25
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,110
discs so why did you Monty settle on

26
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:56,760
this Atari style upgrade instead of

27
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,809
getting scared and looking for the

28
00:00:57,809 --> 00:00:59,129
asshole who switched the board game for

29
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:00,719
a video game cartridge this kid thinks

30
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,129
wait a minute maybe I should stick to

31
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:03,359
some licensed game into my machine and

32
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,199
see what happens

33
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:05,309
Metallica always taught me not to be

34
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:07,020
afraid of death man it's bad enough that

35
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,400
Alex had this number of cassette tapes

36
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,610
even in 1996 but in 2017 a teenager like

37
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,250
Spencer has fun CDs huh who knew there

38
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,600
was an extra Kardashian living in New

39
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,970
Hampshire also yes it's 2017 and all

40
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:19,950
these kids have Sony phones which is

41
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,900
weirdly noticeable at all we just speed

42
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,030
this up free cos makes me very

43
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:24,869
uncomfortable

44
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:26,340
my dispenser and fridge meet here

45
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,080
Spencer can give fridge this paper

46
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,549
almost anywhere including at the school

47
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:31,229
well anyone knowing it's not like he's

48
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:33,090
your best friend your entire childhood

49
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,960
mumbles position that poor man so awful

50
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,189
it happened to those people

51
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:39,600
three of the four main characters just

52
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,070
happened to be near the freak house just

53
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,479
before they all get sent to detention

54
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:43,950
where they will play the Jumanji video

55
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,270
game that directly relates to the family

56
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,590
who used to live here this world

57
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:49,680
swallows up kids like you damn when Eric

58
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,240
straton became a gynecologist in Beverly

59
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,649
Hills I didn't realize he would get so

60
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:54,240
cynical I hope that went well but it

61
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,409
will get a glass of buttermilk before

62
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:56,850
randomly and critically threatened the

63
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:00,479
next team but why what possible purpose

64
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,280
does bethany being late for fucking gym

65
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,840
class serve not to perpetuate this

66
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,880
utterly useless movie cliche this is

67
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,950
school we are supposed to be learning

68
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,200
things that actually

69
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,060
okay somehow things these kids have

70
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,170
probably done the entire school year

71
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:13,640
become a big problem on the same day

72
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,680
bethany talks on the phone during a quiz

73
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,569
Martha goes all Lisa Simpson during gym

74
00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:19,430
class and Spencers obvious homework he's

75
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,930
done for fridge is finally discovered

76
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:22,550
after several attempts it's the last

77
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,739
sentence of Anthony's paper on westward

78
00:02:24,739 --> 00:02:27,260
expansion coincidentally it's the last

79
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,000
sentence of your paper on westward

80
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,770
expansion from last year

81
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:32,090
this teacher must make copies of her

82
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:33,350
students papers to reference for

83
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:34,970
plagiarism later since I thought it was

84
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:36,200
customary to give the student their

85
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,760
paper back with a grade on it either

86
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,230
that or this teacher out of nowhere

87
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:41,330
remembers one sentence of a paper from a

88
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,790
year ago or some bull yeah you also used

89
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:46,340
the same metaphor the shredding wildfire

90
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,650
in your papers on the Boston Tea Party

91
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:51,920
the Battle of Gettysburg and the woman's

92
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,019
suffrage movement man this teachers

93
00:02:54,019 --> 00:02:55,910
played a long con on Spencer here such a

94
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,709
memorable cliche and she didn't call him

95
00:02:57,709 --> 00:02:59,390
out on it once after all those times yes

96
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,799
she knew one day Spencer would help

97
00:03:00,799 --> 00:03:02,420
someone cheek and he'd used that term

98
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,799
and then her master plan would be

99
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:06,920
complete welcome to detention only four

100
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,569
people got in trouble today one of the

101
00:03:08,569 --> 00:03:10,489
normal rejects at this school also why

102
00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:11,930
is the principal handling detention

103
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,220
he doesn't have better things to do

104
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,900
doesn't that job go to the track coach

105
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,310
or the health teacher or something all

106
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,959
of these old magazines are bound for the

107
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:20,380
recycling plant it seems all the staples

108
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,820
must be removed what world are you

109
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,410
living in where the staples need to be

110
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:26,239
removed I guess you could be lying but

111
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,640
why bother I'll recognize it so was the

112
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,380
game just content to not be sucking

113
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,640
anyone into it for 20 years

114
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,470
I mean the drums weren't even beating to

115
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,820
call attention to the console fridge

116
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,769
just happened to find that I mean the

117
00:03:36,769 --> 00:03:37,970
board game went out of its way to

118
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:39,410
recruit people so much so that they had

119
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:40,850
to bury that to prevent it from harming

120
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:43,579
fools I came for those who seek to find

121
00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:46,519
a way to leave their world behind their

122
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:49,340
reading what's fun graphic I don't know

123
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,540
I don't think it matters how much this

124
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,220
is of course why the avatars are so

125
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,690
completely converse to the real world

126
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:55,579
characters but why would Spencer say

127
00:03:55,579 --> 00:03:57,230
this when he knows jackpot this game

128
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:59,810
Franklin moose Finbar it clearly says

129
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:01,250
mouse but I'm sure this will lead to

130
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,530
hilarious comic I drink later also it's

131
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:05,090
kind of crazy that this game doesn't

132
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:06,319
have pictures of the character you were

133
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,880
selecting I'm sure this will lead to

134
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,230
hilarious comic hygiene flater

135
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:11,569
I think it's now supposedly intelligent

136
00:04:11,569 --> 00:04:13,069
character Spencer does this instead of

137
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:14,540
you know immediately unplugging the game

138
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,280
why is this game sucking the characters

139
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,169
in at random times so you're telling me

140
00:04:18,169 --> 00:04:20,090
Jumanji has the power to fuse with video

141
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:22,250
games to become a video game but

142
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,360
doesn't have enough power to take home

143
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,850
for them at the same time ah we just got

144
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,200
sucked into journey to the mysterious

145
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,960
island who you was she how are you guys

146
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,090
I hate to be you that guy wait a minute

147
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:34,040
I love being that guy but is this how

148
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,420
you talk to people you don't know do you

149
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,130
go to a party find a stranger and demand

150
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:38,720
a know who they are what is going on

151
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,160
I understand they be confused but the

152
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,990
last two solid minutes has been all the

153
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,340
characters constantly asking a version

154
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,200
of this question you're short he's fat

155
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,850
she's hot and he's the rock let's move

156
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:49,490
on I am Spencer I'm Spencer

157
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,620
yep that's Benson oh yeah I remember

158
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,420
that character trait about Spencer being

159
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,890
paranoid that hasn't come up since the

160
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:56,180
very beginning of the movie that's how

161
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,040
he's ultimately identified as being the

162
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,960
real deal I'm an overweight match man

163
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,910
sweet I've been looking for a sequel to

164
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,500
the hot chick and I finally got it you

165
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,060
gotta love the Jumanji game it doesn't

166
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,200
even tell you what these marks are

167
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,300
Jumanji is a bigger dick than mist at

168
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,520
least you could quit mist I have a

169
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,310
tattoo I have 1 to 1 it's the only

170
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,169
explanation that old game machine must

171
00:05:15,169 --> 00:05:17,950
have electrocuted

172
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,110
man I know Bethenny's annoying and all

173
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:21,520
but it's not like the other two didn't

174
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,050
see the hippo coming up the deep blue

175
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,460
see her we couldn't give her a heads up

176
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,950
it's moose it's not Mouse no good sir

177
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:29,230
I'm quite sure it's Mouse if Nigel can

178
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,490
only answer when he's been programmed

179
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:32,620
answer then how does he know to correct

180
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,390
Mouse on his name unless this is

181
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,590
something the programmers knew it would

182
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:37,030
be a common mistake we need your help

183
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:38,770
what if you think that I checked this

184
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:40,300
letter to make sure that Nigel read this

185
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,040
narration 100 percent correctly you're

186
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,630
right and he didn't if it wasn't that I

187
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:45,430
just send the narration you can see the

188
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:47,860
bind I'm in Van Pelt assumed dominion

189
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,830
over all of Jumanji screeches

190
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:52,120
controlling them then why doesn't he

191
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,560
have control over all these humans that

192
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,060
are standing around if he bosses his

193
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,500
henchmen around sure but Nigel's

194
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,420
completely unaffected right and remember

195
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,190
the goal he's made the same thing oh

196
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:02,320
here's a map of Jumanji that's curious

197
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,970
why didn't he just hand over the map

198
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:05,740
before he got caught in that loop saying

199
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,390
the same verse over and over he's going

200
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,890
to say the verse again after this anyway

201
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:10,360
well you can't just give us a ride to

202
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,100
the statue fridge would be amazing at

203
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,570
writing Lord of the Rings why can't we

204
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:15,610
just leave stop the game without doing

205
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:17,140
all this stuff

206
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,180
Jack Black it's the only one that's

207
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,040
actively trying to mimic his IRL

208
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,290
character and it's hilarious once enough

209
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:25,390
this is what I'm good at playing video

210
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:28,030
games it's what I do it's literally the

211
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:30,550
main thing that I do okay fine we saw

212
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:31,990
you playing a game briefly earlier in

213
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,520
this movie but there is nothing in this

214
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,750
movie that suggests you're a hardcore

215
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,370
gamer we've seen you help fridge cheat

216
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:37,870
on his paper more than we've seen you as

217
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,790
Wade wants but the problem is there's

218
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:42,670
nothing here what do you mean there's

219
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,140
nothing there it's a map just like he

220
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:46,150
said cartography I've got to wonder what

221
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,770
a Bethany decided not to go

222
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:49,120
and it was just Spencer fridge and

223
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,650
Martha would there be an AI professor

224
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:52,060
Shelley talking with them right now who

225
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:55,030
can read the map hey Leon Tala G what

226
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:56,350
does that even mean a few minutes ago

227
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,700
fridge discovered he possessed knowledge

228
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,320
he didn't even know he had because of

229
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,850
his character but Bethany doesn't know

230
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:03,940
what paleontology is huh strength is my

231
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:04,510
weakness

232
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:07,180
how is strength my weakness this is an

233
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,740
excellent question if they still have

234
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,030
most of the characteristics of their

235
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,560
real-life selves in this universe how do

236
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,910
these strengths and weaknesses apply

237
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:15,160
like it's I their only nothing right Mad

238
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,260
Max Jumanji Road Jesus but all this

239
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,940
firepower even in a game these guys

240
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,680
would be toast but apparently the video

241
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,300
game revert stew movie rules when it

242
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,980
comes to Amy why would the game have

243
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,690
this perspective every other shot has

244
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:27,040
been from the viewpoint of one of the

245
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,140
main characters so this flash to villain

246
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:29,800
vision is hooey

247
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,750
let me see you back inside

248
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,100
you're backtracked you have my weapons

249
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,360
we haven't even checked the goddamn

250
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,220
backpack until now he's been carrying

251
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,410
that the entire game get on my back

252
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:40,660
I would rather die on my back no I'm

253
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,070
gonna die character says there's no way

254
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,510
they will do something only to be doing

255
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:45,040
that very thing in the next scene cliche

256
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,080
jeez I'm so tired of seeing the main

257
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,490
characters chase through a wooded area

258
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:50,500
and suddenly come upon a cliff in every

259
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,160
action movie

260
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,930
see also Indiana Jones Pirates of the

261
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,880
Caribbean Star Trek the revenant Furious

262
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,590
7 are you saying that we can actually

263
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:58,930
die in here I mean I don't know for sure

264
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:01,750
I'm not sure you're not sure mr. video

265
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,550
game genius look I get that fridges

266
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,020
frustrated but this kind of an argument

267
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,090
even in a movie like this is silly it

268
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:08,290
makes it sound like fridge has zero

269
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:10,300
common sense as if he thinks Spencer

270
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,980
gets trapped in games all the time I

271
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,200
gotta take a leak first I've been

272
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,200
dreading us all day but so do I please

273
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,480
tell me one videogame outside of like

274
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,370
Leisure Suit Larry where a character has

275
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:22,419
to take a piss in the middle of a

276
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:24,310
mission also this sets up a scene of

277
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,780
Bethenny discovering how to pee as a man

278
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,430
which is so over long and unfunny that

279
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:28,600
I'm convinced it was originally supposed

280
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,810
to be in an animated kids movie

281
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:35,050
I guess jet blacks part was originally

282
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:37,120
meant to be played by Luis he came first

283
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,339
on if killing gravestone was so goddamn

284
00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:40,990
important to Van Pelt why didn't he go

285
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:42,669
there himself I was something every

286
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:45,490
creature every soldier to hunt them down

287
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:47,440
why haven't you done that already

288
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,940
could you say that one more time please

289
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,070
with the smaller teeth you have control

290
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:53,040
of that or is that just happen naturally

291
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,260
it just happens naturally okay that got

292
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,580
me that's worth it's enough

293
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:58,690
where the hell is Jamaal he's supposed

294
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:00,220
to be I thought we were out in the

295
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:02,320
fucking jungle but this bizarre straight

296
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:02,800
out of late

297
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,630
Istanbul it probably just meant that I

298
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:06,760
love cake that couldn't resist it

299
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,650
Jumanji somehow I made one of Finbar's

300
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:10,450
weaknesses cake which should probably

301
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:11,770
never come up during the game but

302
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:13,180
somehow it does because the movie

303
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,890
overrides the logic of the game and it's

304
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:16,480
hilarious to watch Kevin Hart explode I

305
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,310
have this map that like has a missing

306
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:20,260
piece dr. brace stone thank goodness

307
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:20,770
you're here

308
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:22,540
we need to find the missing piece if

309
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:23,800
you're going to make a cartographer the

310
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,240
only character who can read the map then

311
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,260
why would you make this character

312
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,880
completely ignore the only one who can

313
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,650
read it and again News playing brave

314
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:31,900
stone if he's not selected what you need

315
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:36,400
is in the basket one false move you're

316
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,440
in a casket this riddle reminds me that

317
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,910
there's really been none of this since

318
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,380
the beginning of the game I wasn't there

319
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,000
a rhyme about the hippos of the river or

320
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,950
the mighty roar out in the valley yeah

321
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:45,640
the best way to

322
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,720
sneak up on the people you're trying to

323
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,490
capture is to scream hey at the top of

324
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:50,650
your lungs rock blocking hello doctor

325
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:52,780
been a long time I believe you have

326
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:55,030
something that belongs to me

327
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,680
so is Van Pelt's supposed to be British

328
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,630
or not because if so I'm not buying this

329
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:59,980
kind of accent for a second

330
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,540
stay off the white bricks what and

331
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,640
freeze see flame sure does enjoy those

332
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,930
dramatic orders even though he could

333
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:06,400
have given them at any time long before

334
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,760
now looks like about su plan he must

335
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,840
have crawled out of this hole long

336
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,430
here's where the movie doesn't seem like

337
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:13,510
they're playing a video game anymore

338
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,190
this is a cutscene that the main

339
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:16,810
characters don't get to see and they're

340
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:18,460
discussing very specific details that a

341
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,870
game like this wouldn't be able to

342
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,580
comprehend man takes actions a video

343
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,290
game wouldn't bother what is the old

344
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:24,580
main villain kills one of his henchmen

345
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,530
because he screwed up chestnut how else

346
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:27,640
would we know this guy is evil if he

347
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,010
didn't do this who's Alan Parrish he's

348
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:31,870
the guy who built this place nice nod to

349
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,160
the original but it brings up a lot of

350
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,990
questions how did the videogame Jumanji

351
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:36,490
reconcile its world with board game

352
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:38,410
Jumanji video game Jumanji turned into a

353
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:39,940
completely different game with different

354
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,800
set of rules namely you can get out of

355
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,880
this place if you can get to the end

356
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,620
Alan had no such luck because future

357
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,820
Bonnie Hunt ran away from the game and

358
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,110
the original those keeping him stuck

359
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:48,820
here I realized that with upgrades come

360
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,770
different rules but what this game did

361
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:52,030
to Alan Parrish is one of the bigger

362
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,680
dick moves I can remember once I got

363
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,720
down to my last life I realized I was

364
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,190
screwed and then I was never gonna get

365
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,750
out of here by myself ok let me take

366
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,160
that back Jumanji the video game

367
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,570
basically did the same thing to camp

368
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:03,130
rocks Nick Jonas that it did down in

369
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,690
Parrish from only this time there was no

370
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:06,340
way to know that other people needed to

371
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,630
play the game let's not forget that

372
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:09,370
Jumanji specifically changed into a

373
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:11,290
video game because when Alex wasn't

374
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:12,970
being played by Nick Jonas he said who

375
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:14,560
plays board games I've never once said

376
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,240
hey man you need five players for this

377
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,890
even bigger dick move the game's

378
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:20,290
objective is to save Jumanji and Jumanji

379
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:21,280
is a colossal asshole

380
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,540
half the stuff that came at me I had

381
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,910
zero way to deal with now you can't kill

382
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,470
a black mom with a margarita then how

383
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:27,640
the hell did Alex get to the

384
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,380
transportation shed level or really

385
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,640
through any of the levels up till now

386
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,740
you're our missing piece you were the

387
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,450
thing that we needed to find yeah but

388
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:35,470
the game told them about the missing

389
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:36,940
piece and had they gone in with all the

390
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,380
five players what would the missing

391
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,360
piece be then also Bethany is right but

392
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,070
how is that possible and why would

393
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:43,660
anyone make the connection they'd need

394
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,340
to find a fifth character if camp rocked

395
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,350
to the final jams Nick Jonas doesn't

396
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:48,820
happen to be wandering around the bazaar

397
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,560
after they did the snake challenge they

398
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,090
never find this guy unless the game

399
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:53,350
itself somehow made it happen

400
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:54,850
also also there were only four

401
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:56,410
controllers on the console so the game

402
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:57,550
was setting these assholes up for

403
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,000
failure from the get-go

404
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,710
get past these guards last time I just

405
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:01,940
waited somebody left how long did that

406
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:04,400
take three weeks we find out later these

407
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,140
guards are true video game characters

408
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:08,060
who are stuck in some sort of loop so

409
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,290
why did they ever leave the post

410
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:11,300
distracting guys is like the main thing

411
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,220
I do he plays video games i distract

412
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:13,700
guys

413
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:17,750
she don't exactly have the toolkit not

414
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,120
me

415
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,990
Bethany basically played a whole new

416
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,430
level of pronoun game here but

417
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:23,840
apparently she knew she was in a movie

418
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,280
and was ready to make a big dramatic

419
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,110
reveal also do they really not have

420
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,430
enough weapons to take out two guards

421
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:30,200
pinbar has a whole sack of weapons he

422
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,730
could get brave stone and Ruby

423
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:33,170
roundhouse knows all the martial arts

424
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,330
okay let's talk about your walk take

425
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:36,020
your time

426
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,430
my favorite a woman the Pygmalion

427
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:43,040
Diaries like this I think you're ready

428
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,750
this flirt mission literally has no time

429
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,460
constraints so why not practice on the

430
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,840
rock and Kevin Hart before going down

431
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,640
there oh yeah so they can create another

432
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,230
funny situation damn I keep forgetting

433
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:51,410
that

434
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:53,990
she's pretty fly and those guys don't

435
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:56,540
meet a lot of new people flaw sure Alex

436
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,940
is from 1996 but he's also a fucking

437
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,440
metalhead according to his room decor

438
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,750
and I don't remember any metalheads in

439
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:05,089
1996 using the word fly to describe a

440
00:13:05,089 --> 00:13:06,980
hot girl I'm just saying I'm sure they'd

441
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,450
like to get jiggy with us nobody was

442
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:10,670
saying jiggy in 1996 either the word

443
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,470
only gained steam in 1998 when Will

444
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:14,540
Smith released getting jiggy wit it from

445
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,460
his Big Willie style album hello little

446
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,050
lady what are you doing out here all

447
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:19,760
alone how does every NPC in this game

448
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,470
not know who Ruby is she's one of only

449
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:23,270
five main characters in the game you

450
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,860
guys like it yes it might not be a

451
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,300
dance-off but it's still solving

452
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,920
problems with dancing which is the odd

453
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,660
thing every movie must have nowadays

454
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:32,180
so are these NPCs getting turned on by

455
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,589
this they obviously aren't paying

456
00:13:33,589 --> 00:13:35,300
attention to their work even though they

457
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,890
repeat the same phrase over and over is

458
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:38,480
the power of digital boners greater than

459
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,450
the power of surveillance Ruby's

460
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:43,310
strength this dance fighting but is this

461
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:45,260
really it she's not really fucking

462
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,030
dancing at all just kicking regular ass

463
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:49,070
with music in the background look good

464
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:51,110
for this henchman role but the xenia

465
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,910
onatopp seems like an extremely

466
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:54,410
inefficient fight move that's nice but

467
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:59,270
wouldn't this destroy the helicopter and

468
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,800
yet when Spencer throws fruit off the

469
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,720
helicopter they all chase after it I

470
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,339
don't get you Monty sometimes the

471
00:14:04,339 --> 00:14:05,750
solutions are impossible and sometimes

472
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:06,530
they are we too easy

473
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:08,660
also if Van Pelt's still has control of

474
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,280
all the animals in Jumanji why can't one

475
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,690
of the Rhinos pick up the jewel in its

476
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:12,550
mouth and take it back

477
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,440
to it every one of these rhinos has a

478
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,000
murder boner that's so strong that they

479
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,350
disregard what has to be the most

480
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:19,200
important thing in their universe oh

481
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,060
right I know Spencer the rock Gilpin is

482
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,920
confident in his catching abilities but

483
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,570
what if he misses here the gamble to

484
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:27,190
push fridge out of the chopper was made

485
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:29,320
after seeing that he had two lives left

486
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,180
but if fridge falls here he's back among

487
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,680
the rhinos and his totally fucking dead

488
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,570
man also why would you risk everyone's

489
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:35,829
life for this maneuver I guess they did

490
00:14:35,829 --> 00:14:37,300
a recent course on collateral damage in

491
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,620
this high school why did they land here

492
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,089
even if the map hasn't revealed the

493
00:14:40,089 --> 00:14:41,560
ultimate location of the Jaguar they

494
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,820
should be flying around looking for it

495
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:46,930
right let's go oh yeah let's not forget

496
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:48,399
they gave this already unlucky character

497
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:49,810
a weakness that gives him a highly

498
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:51,459
likely chance of dying considering the

499
00:14:51,459 --> 00:14:55,269
mosquito population in Jumanji this is

500
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:56,950
kinda clever but it's totally random

501
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:59,170
it's more CPR ex machina than something

502
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:00,790
they came up with intuitively I just

503
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:02,560
keep thinking about my poor parents what

504
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,300
they must have been through why because

505
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,399
I was sitting in my hideout too afraid

506
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,170
to finish the game yeah but could you

507
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:09,310
have finish the game without the four

508
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:10,870
other players the movie has been pretty

509
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,190
clear that you were once you came in

510
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:16,149
here alone jump squirrel also if you're

511
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:17,620
going to point out that climbing is won

512
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,029
a brave stone strengths then I'm

513
00:15:19,029 --> 00:15:20,290
compelled to tell you that one of the

514
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:21,760
other strengths is that he is fearless

515
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,440
as well so get the fuck out of here with

516
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,209
the squirrels a good friend fetch

517
00:15:25,209 --> 00:15:27,040
happened with these two to bring them

518
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,209
back together as friends they've

519
00:15:28,209 --> 00:15:29,740
literally both killed each other this

520
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,329
afternoon alone and they're still

521
00:15:31,329 --> 00:15:37,680
bickering up until this point this works

522
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,880
fridge is able to reason with a wild

523
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,500
elephant apparently because he is a

524
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,600
zoologist and all zoologist no elephant

525
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,140
language I can't give you the jewel

526
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:48,700
because I don't have it geez dude you

527
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,230
could have said that a lot earlier it's

528
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:51,399
not like you knew fruits would come

529
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:52,450
crashing through riding an elephant

530
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:55,180
right about now elephant begin the climb

531
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,709
it now feels like this movie is just

532
00:15:56,709 --> 00:15:57,880
making it up as it goes along

533
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,350
the only reason an elephant is here is

534
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:00,399
because a series of random events

535
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,320
occurred this jumping is so fake they

536
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,730
might as well put Mario sounds with it

537
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,500
in fact let's rewind this and do just

538
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:09,550
that I'll take that man Van Pelt's

539
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:11,079
spends an awful lot of time saying give

540
00:16:11,079 --> 00:16:12,399
it to me and I'll take that when he

541
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:13,750
could literally walk over and take that

542
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,490
or have one of his thousands of animals

543
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:17,620
he controls take that also how do you

544
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:18,160
get up here

545
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,600
besides the hit-or-miss Animal Control

546
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,970
in Jumanji what are van Pelt powers its

547
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:23,620
movie interested in explaining natch to

548
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,449
us is this motorcycle really driving up

549
00:16:25,449 --> 00:16:25,870
a steeper

550
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:27,160
rocki almost completely vertical I'm

551
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,990
game cheats on where people respawn

552
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:30,580
after their death and puts Martha closer

553
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:37,720
to the Jaguar than she wants before hell

554
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,279
of a game too bad it doesn't have much

555
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:40,089
replay value

556
00:16:40,089 --> 00:16:42,640
oh no not stuck villain character 118

557
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,070
played by an overqualified actor aka the

558
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:48,100
anti kill monger where's Alex so did

559
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,029
they all just walk the hell out of

560
00:16:49,029 --> 00:16:50,620
detention because I'm pretty sure they

561
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,910
didn't make a dent in those magazine

562
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:54,130
staples Hey look hate to break it to

563
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:55,720
everyone but getting Alex back to his

564
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,820
home in 1996 would have changed a lot

565
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,110
more than this there's a chance these

566
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:00,490
kids aren't even born when they get back

567
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:01,930
since they effectively changed the past

568
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:03,490
and even the slightest change would have

569
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:04,990
caused some sort of sound a butterfly or

570
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,640
Thunder effect hey Dad were you give me

571
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,089
a second

572
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:08,559
not only the kids walk up on Alex at the

573
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,390
exact minute his expositional minivan

574
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:12,189
shows up he somehow recognizes four

575
00:17:12,189 --> 00:17:13,540
adolescents that look nothing like the

576
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,220
avatars he played with over 20 years ago

577
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,360
Bethany

578
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:20,709
Spencer yeah Ruby Brown house that would

579
00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:22,270
make you fridge did he never learn

580
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:24,880
Martha's real name Martha why didn't you

581
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,610
say Martha go get that girl doctor

582
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:29,440
gravestone so Bethany has embraced

583
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,910
nature and wants to go back packing

584
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:32,380
Spencer and Martha are working on

585
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,730
hooking up and coming out of their

586
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:35,950
shells so what's up with fridge is he

587
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:37,840
like gonna do his own homework now I

588
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,610
mean it seems like everyone else has

589
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:40,750
some real character growth after the

590
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,370
game last time they kissed it was a

591
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:44,230
sloppy pretty much total failure now

592

594

don't you understand I found a cure for

595
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,130
the fucking plague of the 20th century

596
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:01,500
and now I've lost don't understand the

597
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,610
obsession with throwing the ball new

598
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:26,250

welcome to detention you have exactly

603
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,620
eight hours and 54 minutes to think

604
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:50,040
about why what happens if we use up all

605
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:50,700
our lives

606
00:18:50,700 --> 00:19:04,220
