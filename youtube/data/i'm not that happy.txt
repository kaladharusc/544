1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:15,360

00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:50,489
and listen to the Tron soundtrack by

17
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:57,660
Daft Punk guaranteed speed increase

18
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,820
back when I was daily vlogging used to

19
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,250
say that talking to the cameras a little

20
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,980
bit like talking to a therapist I mean I

21
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:06,210
don't know who you are I don't know who

22
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:07,620
most of you are but just like a

23
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,060
therapist you don't really talk back

24
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,830
much and you give me really considerate

25
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:13,410
feedback in the comments but anyway I've

26
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:15,420
missed these little chats and that's why

27
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,400
I want to do more of these I don't know

28
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,630
maybe I'm just being like a little

29
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:20,340
sentimental because my family still in

30
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,110
South Africa playing with penguins

31
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:26,490
yeah but I always have things I want to

32
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:28,200
talk about like this shark video I saw

33
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:35,280
yesterday and these videos serve as like

34
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,560
a great platform for me to discuss the

35
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,600
things that I care about another thing I

36
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,040
want to get into today for today's video

37
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,979
is about happiness on YouTube and all

38
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,229
that first I want to give you like a two

39
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:48,600
second update one I just got back from

40
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,550
South Africa in Las Vegas and all kinds

41
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:52,320
of other travel feels good to be back in

42
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,960
New York City focus to the new company

43
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,850
downstairs the thing I'm doing with CNN

44
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,470
it's coming along really well we're

45
00:01:58,470 --> 00:01:59,970
going to be hiring people soon building

46
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:02,009
Studios making a bunch of videos I'll

47
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:04,259
keep you updated as things progress but

48
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:06,119
it's starting to like turn from like a

49
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:09,780
liquid of mystery into a gel of slightly

50
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,490
less mystery it's coming along though

51
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:14,280
three life's gotten kind of weird since

52
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,319
I stopped daily vlogging I got so used

53
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,420
to this lifestyle of like literally

54
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,850
working 20 hours a day to crank out

55
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:24,120
those videos I like don't know what to

56
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,190
do with myself now cuz I have all this

57
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:28,290
time I did build a gaming station here

58
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:30,240
in the studio I've been working on a

59
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:38,470
gaming setup in there

60
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:44,750
you've both done so 10 more on that soon

61
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:47,180
and I've been like crazy focused on

62
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,980
Fitness which feels really great but

63
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:51,280
mostly I've just been enjoying like

64
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,019
returning to being a human being but I

65
00:02:54,019 --> 00:02:56,120
do miss creating something every day so

66
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,620
that's why I'm gonna do more videos like

67
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:00,290
like this but I'd say the biggest update

68
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:01,610
since I stopped blogging like the

69
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:03,380
biggest thing is that I have all this

70
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:06,230
free brain space like it kind of hard to

71
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:07,940
explain but when you're making a video

72
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,769
every single day you wake up thinking

73
00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:11,239
about what's today's video what's

74
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:13,340
today's vlog episode gonna be and then

75
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,329
throughout the day you're just trying to

76
00:03:14,329 --> 00:03:16,099
create it and then you're up all night

77
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:18,440
trying to shape it together you fall

78
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,790
asleep you wake up the next day just

79
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:22,940
like Groundhog Day you start over again

80
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:28,160
[Music]

81
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,710
and that would out for like 600 straight

82
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,730
days or something like that

83
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:33,890
and being away from that for a month

84
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:35,630
like I've been able to really think

85
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,490
about big things that I want to do and

86
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:40,160
redirect my career it feels great

87
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,870
and I hope these videos will serve as a

88
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,580
little bit of a vessel for me to share

89
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:47,090
that with you so yeah happiness there's

90
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:49,670
this small youtuber called PewDiePie you

91
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:52,820
poodiepee pewdiepie made a video like a

92
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,380
couple days ago and it was about what's

93
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,810
called forced positivity on YouTube and

94
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:58,940
by the way Felix I like these kinds of

95
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,530
videos I think they're insightful and

96
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:01,940
they're smart and I encourage you to

97
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:04,580
make them the video was about how a lot

98
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,610
of daily vloggers have a sort of an aura

99
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:10,340
of forced positivity or like a level of

100
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,950
superficiality around their content and

101
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:14,870
about how that can be dangerous because

102
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:17,330
young people might perceive that as like

103
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:19,400
if you're not happy all the time you're

104
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,049
doing something wrong or or might make

105
00:04:21,049 --> 00:04:22,370
you feel less satisfied with your own

106
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:24,110
life because you're not happy like the

107
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:25,760
vloggers that you watch day in and day

108
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:30,260
out now me as a former now retired daily

109
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,900
vlogger and someone who gets like emails

110
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,610
and tweets every day from people saying

111
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:37,490
I appreciate your positivity I thought I

112
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:39,080
should chime in on this kind of my

113
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,730
thesis when I was daily vlogging was to

114
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,620
like pluck the happy and fun and

115
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,140
interesting aspects of my life out of

116
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:47,150
the 24 hour a day that is my life and

117
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:49,970
turned into a 10 minute video for you

118
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:51,950
the audience and I chose that approach

119
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,900
because I think much like a lot of you

120
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,520
I enjoy videos that make me feel good

121
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,830
versus ones that are overwhelmingly

122
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,930
depressing no one wants to watch a video

123
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,790
of someone groveling about how lame

124
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:04,490
their life is but I do think that means

125
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:06,170
that there is a big opportunity for

126
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:07,970
viewers to see that as these sort of

127
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:10,040
totality of my life like my life every

128
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,230
second of my life is that happy and it

129
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:15,140
isn't like no one's life is that happy I

130
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,940
try really hard to live like the

131
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,430
happiest most positive life I can but

132
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:22,340
life is ebb and flow and my life has

133
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:25,070
been no different especially throughout

134
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,900
the vlog and I can remember when I was

135
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,910
daily vlogging the hardest days for me

136
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:31,100
to make videos were days when I was like

137
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,560
having a fight with my wife or something

138
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,570
miserable was happening and I would have

139
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:37,580
to kind of push that out remember in

140
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,229
particular trying to daily vlog when we

141
00:05:39,229 --> 00:05:39,780
were in

142
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:43,050
Texas at Candace's grandfather's funeral

143
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,580
I didn't blog the funeral but I was

144
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,230
trying to make a video that day in

145
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:49,190
shield you viewers from like that

146
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:51,990
difficult part of my life and maybe that

147
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:53,880
could be perceived as dishonest but I

148
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,860
think I was always pretty clear in

149
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,830
saying that the vlog was about the fun

150
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,690
positive interesting aspects of my life

151
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:03,120
and not about the whole picture that was

152
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,220
my life and I think the important

153
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,830
takeaway here is that whether you are a

154
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,600
daily vlogger or someone who watches

155
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,970
daily vloggers is to know that we are

156
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:14,940
all human we all have struggles and just

157
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,340
because you put your life the difference

158
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:20,700
that vloggers me included have is that

159
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,110
we have the opportunity to edit our

160
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:24,630
lives and edit out the parts and leave

161
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:26,490
in the really happy parts but know that

162
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:27,630
they exist

163
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:30,300
so I want to end this video by sharing

164
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,100
with you what is my like really naive

165
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:37,860
basic recipe for finding happiness in my

166
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,780
own life and I will say that whatever

167
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,510
Candis is down were bummed out or we're

168
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:44,340
fighting and I tell her this she's like

169
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,919
Casey shut up I'm not ten years old I

170
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:48,360
don't need your stupid recipe for

171
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,210
happiness but here goes whenever I'm

172
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,400
really down I just try to focus on

173
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,740
what's really good I told you this is

174
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,720
basic and what I mean by that is like

175
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,910
what I look back at life and I see like

176
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:01,800
those when I was with a really bad

177
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,070
breakup I would focus on the fact that I

178
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:07,140
had friends and people who loved and

179
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,970
cared about me and I would take solace

180
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:09,800
in that

181
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,410
even much more serious stuff like 10 11

182
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:15,479
years ago when my dad had cancer that

183
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:17,729
was one of the more difficult things I

184
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:21,530
ever dealt with in my life but I would I

185
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:24,630
remember thinking at least he also has a

186
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:27,390
job that gives him healthcare and that

187
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:29,190
was just like a little bit of something

188
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:31,169
for me to focus on that was positive out

189
00:07:31,169 --> 00:07:36,030
of a really really situation that's kind

190
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:36,419
of it

191
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:37,860
it's like today for example it's

192
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,550
freezing cold and snowing outside but

193
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:43,480
it's so cold

194
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,970
I can keep my juices refrigerated

195
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:51,460
without having to use any energy that's

196
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:57,790
kind of positive just quick caveat this

197
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,680
video is not at all intended to be a

198
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,140
commentary on mental illness or

199
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,730
depression or anything like that it's

200
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:06,520
more about vloggers like me and the kind

201
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:10,830
of superficiality that vlogging can have

202
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,880
Felix mentioned this in his video too

203
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,100
but the depression and mental illness is

204
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,050
is real and something to be taking very

205
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:19,540
seriously I put a link below to some

206
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,250
online resources to people who may be

207
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,070
struggling with with mental health

208
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:34,000
