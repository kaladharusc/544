1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,909
this afternoon I'll be flying from San

2
00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:04,850
Francisco to New York City in jetblue's

3
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:08,130
mint first class suite this will be a

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:10,000
comprehensive review of that experience

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:34,940
[Music]

6
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:37,500
now I've always been a very big fan of

7
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,320
the Jet Blue like regular economy class

8
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,840
is my favorite economy class this new

9
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,610
first class experience it feels a little

10
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:46,210
different from other airlines

11
00:00:46,210 --> 00:01:15,400
[Music]

12
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,729
and now a brief tour of my suite over

13
00:01:19,729 --> 00:01:22,310
here on the window side of this big open

14
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:26,330
kind of shelf like space it's honestly a

15
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:27,590
lot of space I don't know what it's

16
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:29,420
meant to be used for like a second

17
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,490
person a small person could sleep up

18
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:34,250
there I have a little door on my suite

19
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:45,180
here ready

20
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,070
now there's no shower on this plane

21
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,840
obviously if not an Emirates plane

22
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,680
dreams do come true I am showering on

23
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,860
their friends but they do give you nice

24
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,250
moist clean smelling towels to sort of

25
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,200
clean yourself up with I mean you've got

26
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,260
two power outlets they got one pen and

27
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,270
USB great way to charge your camera

28
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,890
batteries when you're making airplane to

29
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,690
review videos mid-flight

30
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:11,370
additionally there's a third power

31
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,520
outlet on the right side I don't know I

32
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,870
mean that's a lot of power out I

33
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,520
appreciate it that's a lot of power

34
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,040
outlets now just the right ear seat here

35
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,120
is a cell phone holder water bottle

36
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:29,720
holder

37
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:40,489
[Music]

38
00:02:40,489 --> 00:02:45,120
TV here probably like 15 inches your TV

39
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,060
remote is located right here

40
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,700
[Applause]

41
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,040
now over here is like that maybe another

42
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,020
cell phone holder I got my toothbrush in

43
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,120
there then there's this gigantic cubby

44
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,180
right here I don't know what this

45
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:05,880
cubbies made for its huge they turned

46
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:12,990
the lights on

47
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:25,550
your city over here

48
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:31,400
our proceed

49
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:39,260
legroom is pretty ridiculous

50
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,239
the massage is not like those massage

51
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:47,180
chairs at the mall

52
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:50,900
I'm eternal

53
00:03:50,900 --> 00:04:01,709
[Music]

54
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:04,329
compared to my bed at home it's lumpy

55
00:04:04,329 --> 00:04:07,239
and compared to an airplane seat it's an

56
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:09,220
absolute dream

57
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:12,490
foods here now one of my favorite parts

58
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:14,350
a JetBlue or all the free snacks you get

59
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:17,440
in the back but in the mint here you get

60
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,480
actual dinner but the menu is a little

61
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,270
different from other planes they give

62
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,070
you all these choices of what you can

63
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,800
get and you get to pick three from all

64
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,170
the choice I'm gonna go with the ricotta

65
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:33,520
gnudi the gross grilled salmon and the

66
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,200
beef stew

67
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:47,240
[Music]

68
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,439
nope that's good

69
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:57,980
so here we got my three dishes

70
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:01,439
[Music]

71
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:04,000
overall it's a pretty fantastic seat the

72
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,930
amount of space

73
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:09,660
but that's also my main criticism

74
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,900
first class situation on

75
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,870
[Music]

76
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:16,330
see all the seats in mint cost the same

77
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:18,960
you pay the same price whether you're in

78
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,210
these big seats or in one of the

79
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:23,760
two-seater see

80
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,520
first class has a one-two-one

81
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,730
one-two-one configuration meaning the

82
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,320
people sitting in front of me and the

83
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,390
people sitting behind me also in first

84
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:35,730
class have a half the amount of space

85
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:42,830
that I have but he's cost the same price

86
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:45,140
[Music]

87
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,610
p1

88
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:49,889
I know this is on my flight out here I

89
00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:52,139
was in one of these seats it was great

90
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:53,729
don't get me wrong but it was also

91
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:56,939
exactly half as good as the seat I'm in

92
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:57,599
right now

93
00:05:57,599 --> 00:05:59,370
and that's why it's my main criticism

94
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:01,500
these seats they should cost more money

95
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,120
or something because they are way better

96
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,280
than the others teat and every time I've

97
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,110
flown in I'm always jealous of people

98
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:10,500
that get these seats versus me in those

99
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,370
other seats

100
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,469
I know it's like that's not a big thing

101
00:06:13,469 --> 00:06:15,990
to complain about but it is like this is

102
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:19,719
way better than what those people

103
00:06:19,719 --> 00:06:20,590

105
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,440
it's like 1:00 in the morning we're

106
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:34,010
about 25 minutes from New York City the

107
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:36,910
nice gentleman just gave me this a

108
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:41,360
confetti cookie

109
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,900
delicious thanks doubt me it's go right

110
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:45,759
right

111
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:52,590
please the German Shepherd aerosol
