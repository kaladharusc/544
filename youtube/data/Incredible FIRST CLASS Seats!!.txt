6
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:35,219
let me just explain what's going on

7
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:44,530
so last night at midnight we got on a plane that flew a six hours from New

8
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:47,590
York City to London England where we are right now

9
00:00:54,079 --> 00:01:00,739
all we've had a 66 hour layover here that we get back on another plane and

10
00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:04,220
fly 13 hours to Cape Town South Africa

11
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:15,740
we're doing all of this with the baby who is like not psyched on travel and

12
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:18,680
last night things LOL Harry

13
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,680
she was a cry

14
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:25,610
when she was crying she was screaming

15
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:32,320
it's kind of a rough night for the day let that be

16
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,960
15

17
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:42,310
Oh

18
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,700
what

19
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,850
then we got here - 1:00 heathrow airport

20
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:50,870
I am a moment

21
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:56,600
we got lost or lost in the labyrinth that is heathrow airport and Candice is

22
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,440
navigated so we got trapped in some weird room where to push green buttons

23
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,450
to escape

24
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:05,450
there's no innocent

25
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,440
they can just got in a fight with I think four different officials here in

26
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,640
the airport

27
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,330
the whole thing is just particular

28
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:22,780
ultimately we made it here to the lounge which is kind of nice to have delicious

29
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:28,780
food and now we have two more hours before you are next plate and it all

30
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:33,010
starts again also right now i'm using this old tree which is covered in dust

31
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:34,660
as a tripod check this out

32
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:37,660
see there's the camera and it's in a tree

33
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:42,840
all right I gotta get back in there and help Candace with a baby we're going to

34
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,040
be divorced by friday

35
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:53,500
a kid it's left me stuck in the currents Francine's just not leaving the lounge

36
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:57,010
Candace picked a fight with literally every person in there

37
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,500

38
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,550

39
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,300

41
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:33,780

42
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,930

43
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:41,020
our own

44
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:46,510
- I move seats for top and then we're in the back and then the people offered us

45
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:50,380
their seats we got their feet and now we're sitting at the very tip

46
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,850
wyd tip of the airplane

47
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:54,800

48
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,030

50
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,050

51
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:03,050

52
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:20,400

53
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,740

54
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,740
it's like that

55
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:35,610
first to know

56
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:38,180

57
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:41,180

58
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,990
to sleep

59
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,820
the circle

60
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:53,720
this is it really any 20 minutes

61
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,220
teeth

62
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:58,220

63
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,950
always sit on the

64
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:12,009
side of the air

65
00:05:12,009 --> 00:05:15,009
the sunrise

66
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:22,630
Table Mountain

67
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:39,750

68
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:44,380
yeah

69
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:55,039
ok no rush

70
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,430
this is it we're saying goodbye to this point

71
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:01,039
also I would just want to quickly address the fact that we're sitting this

72
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,110
deluxe first class cabin

73
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:06,560
can I saved up for like five years with the airline miles to make this happen

74
00:06:07,129 --> 00:06:10,129
totally worth it

75
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:17,180
the air

76
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:20,350

77
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:22,610

78
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:25,930

81
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:57,470
