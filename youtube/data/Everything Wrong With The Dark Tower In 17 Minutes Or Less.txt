[Music]

2
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:10,290
forty-three seconds of logos I'm

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:11,730
wondering is this a film production

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:14,070
company or is it a request reading wait

5
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:14,549
what

6
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:16,230
okay I know the books don't matter and

7
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:17,550
they apparently didn't do for this

8
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:18,869
movies box office but this is a

9
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:20,699
legendary series and they boiled it down

10
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:22,410
to two half-assed title cards that

11
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:23,430
barely have anything to do with the

12
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,710
gunslingers story Marty angry at this

13
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,060
movie's laziness it's not even two

14
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,970
minutes into it this obvious Easter Egg

15
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:31,590
featuring the discount The Shining twins

16
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:32,850
tells you everything you need to know

17
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:34,350
about how hard this movie's gonna try

18
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:35,820
what is it with these science fiction

19
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,469
planets and multiple moons this close to

20
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:39,239
the planet but everything somehow turned

21
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:41,070
out to be like earth good news if you

22
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,000
were coming into your Dark Tower

23
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,710
experience expecting another Saw movie

24
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,280
you're in luck damn there goes on the

25
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,840
run again the planet can't catch a break

26
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,390
in any universe also I'm sorry when this

27
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:52,739
movie told me that the mind of a child

28
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:54,510
could bring the Dark Tower down I didn't

29
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:55,949
realize it was so fucking literal I

30
00:00:55,949 --> 00:00:57,660
thought it meant a kid's imagination or

31
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,370
something so simple a child could think

32
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,500
of it but literal laser beam shot out of

33
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,629
children's heads what is causing all

34
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:06,750
these earthquakes Christ even espn's to

35
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,970
increase them sorry asshole stepdad

36
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,619
template character but there's no can

37
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:12,600
way that's ESPN considering there's only

38
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,369
the bottom crawl and no other adornment

39
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:16,229
so while it may be ESPN in your mind

40
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:17,670
this movie wasn't willing to pay for it

41
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:21,240
to be featured so ends the apocalypse

42
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,799
coming damn at this point I'd be shocked

43
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,270
if I ever saw a movie based on a Stephen

44
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:25,619
King book that doesn't feature a kid

45
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:30,299
getting bullied you know instead of

46
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:31,890
going to the principal or encountering

47
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:33,150
any consequences for your physical

48
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,920
assault on this asshole why would this

49
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,630
child psychologist have a random framed

50
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,130
picture of the Overlook from The Shining

51
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,720
in his office this New York Post

52
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,250
headline is about a gas explosion that

53
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,720
killed five people but the story is

54
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,549
about a blackout that killed 78 I know

55
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:45,930
that the collapse of the Dark Tower is

56
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:47,490
supposed to bring darkness and fire but

57
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:48,600
I didn't know it brought mismatched

58
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,040
articles involving both of those things

59
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,689
also nostalgia exposition meanwhile and

60
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:56,280
Maze Runner Thomas and Teresa are trying

61
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,329
to figure out what went wrong after

62
00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:02,250
baking those cookies had forgotten the

63
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,170
face of his father the fact that Rowland

64
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,030
and his dad say this out loud seems

65
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,409
counterintuitive to the whole we're

66
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:08,700
being hunted so maybe we should be

67
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,590
pretty quiet strategy stop breathing

68
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,810
these are highly trained gunslingers

69
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:13,860
here and sure well

70
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,870
powerful but neither Stephen nor Rowland

71
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,580
fired off one shot at Walter as soon as

72
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,590
he says stop it never works on new

73
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,900
desert Roland the power you have to

74
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,060
resist my magics look Microsoft Word

75
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,860
doesn't give me a red squiggly line when

76
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,570
I write the magics my brain sure did

77
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:28,920
when I heard Matthew McConaughey say it

78
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,620
until next time old friend okay I

79
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,030
understand this is a sequel or a

80
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,770
spin-off for a different universe or

81
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:36,120
some both other than the Dark Tower

82
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:36,690
series

83
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:37,950
so maybe Roland's already very familiar

84
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,720
with Walter and his shenanigans but in

85
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,430
the movie version could he'd not go

86
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,410
after him right now and either try to

87
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:45,300
talk to him or can kill him Jesus Christ

88
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:49,040
man impact across the desert

89
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,240
yep that was the first line of the

90
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,920
gunslinger sure I'm glad I'm being read

91
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,750
that line for nostalgia sake and not I

92
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,580
don't know seeing it in action on screen

93
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,900
which is the point of a goddamn movie

94
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,620
hey this guy is some kind of soldier

95
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,550
he's called a gunslinger

96
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:03,870
Jake who knows for a fact that his

97
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,489
friend to me doesn't believe this knocks

98
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:06,840
on his door and starts rambling about a

99
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,550
drawing I realize this is so we know

100
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:09,959
what these drawings mean but could we

101
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:11,040
just hear the thoughts in his head

102
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,600
rather than have him explain this to a

103
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,330
disinterested third party it's fun

104
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:18,000
listen pretty sure Jake's mom's only

105
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,230
character traits were listed as

106
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:21,780
disbelieving exasperated and ha you're

107
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,610
gonna go with them right now or I swear

108
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,110
to God I won't drive you down the stairs

109
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:27,209
myself since this is technically a story

110
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:28,560
about the destruction of New York the

111
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,000
movies kind enough to provide us with a

112
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,750
roland emmerich father figure

113
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,709
considering what we've seen of Jake so

114
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:36,570
far does being Jason Bourne fit his

115
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:37,080
character

116

00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,180
this device which helps transport people

to different places in the universe uses

120
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:47,140
1990s modem sounds when it powers on all

121
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,940
so how did the device know to power on

122
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,470
does it sense the kids with abilities

123
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,970
because if it doesn't this universe

124

travelling device is available to any

Boo Radley in Brooklyn this movie is way

126
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:02,170
more trauma legacy than I think it

127
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:04,599
intended not to be confused with Middle

128
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:07,060
Earth or Midgard your pink shoe look

129
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,590
there's like a million pieces of scrap

130
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,060
lumber around here that you could have

131
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,530
thrown through the portal and you went

132
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:12,879
with your fucking shoe what the

133
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,799
explanation is given for the house demon

134
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,329
trying to eat Jake here other than a

135
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:18,190
cheap excuse for some special effects if

136
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,359
there were security measures in place

137
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:20,979
how the hell was it so easy for him to

138
00:04:20,979 --> 00:04:22,570
open the portal portal takes Jake to a

139
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:24,580
place that really really sucks why would

140
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,139
you travel with this place only to have

141
00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:27,580
to walk through a desert for many days

142
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,990
until you find food and water and a

143
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:30,790
reason to live movies only an hour and

144
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:32,620
35 minutes but has time for Jake to get

145
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,930
briefly chased by an internet meme no

146

candidate female age 11 by the way I'm

147
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,280
wondering I go through all the business

148
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,479
with pretending you're from some

149
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,460
psychology camp to abduct these kids why

150
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,660
not just take them and drive off in a

151
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,340
van to the next portal welcome back soon

152
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,860
how was your trip fine do you have any

new leads movie takes the fearsome

154
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,440
character of the man in black and

155
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,389
reduces him to a discount lost target

portals on Keystone earth-like keystone

158
00:04:57,729 --> 00:04:59,289
earth why not just name the planet

159
00:04:59,289 --> 00:05:00,789
something else does putting Keystone in

160
00:05:00,789 --> 00:05:02,139
front of it make it a different name or

161
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:03,789
just show how lazy you are love you

162

mattes choose a pretty face in the world

163

is your oyster lining sir

164
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,240
boy this movie sure really wants to

165
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,590
emphasize the portals and wrap people

166
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:13,450
and bad parenting really anything other

167
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:14,950
than the central gunslinger character

168
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:15,430
also

169
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,080
it's amazing that Jake found the one

170
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,460
portal that was not only lined up with

171
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,169
New York but was also pointed pretty

172
00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:21,850
directly at Rowan with minimal walking

173
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:23,380
required I guess that portal was also

174
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,000
aware of the movie's runtime who is he

175
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,400
he's a sorcerer huh I guess Jake thought

176
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,470
Walter would be played by a late 90s era

177
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:32,050
Sean William Scott this is tribe yelling

178
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:34,870
that forest will go there have Sears who

179
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,729
will read your visions Roland is looking

180
00:05:36,729 --> 00:05:38,349
for Walter and he stumbles on a kid with

181
00:05:38,349 --> 00:05:39,520
visions out in the middle of the desert

182
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,139
and just so happens to be within miles

183
00:05:41,139 --> 00:05:42,820
of a tribe full of prophets who can

184
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,320
interpret those visions if we were

185
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,910
following role in this whole time this

186
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:47,200
would be a deus ex machina of the

187
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,849
highest order and we're sitting it as

188
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,310
such hate neglecting the fact that this

189
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:53,110
is a dick move if this is possible I

190
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,190
don't know why the man in black has

191
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:54,729
anything

192
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,830
like a conflict in his life enough is he

193
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,360
using a handkerchief to pick this up see

194
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,289
worried about the chain of evidence

195
00:05:59,289 --> 00:06:01,120
Matthew McConaughey is playing a true

196
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,830
detective here because he is Dazed and

197
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,180
Confused didn't one of his employees

198
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,800
already tell him that a portal was used

199
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,449
on Keystone Earth and if they know it

200
00:06:07,449 --> 00:06:08,830
was used wouldn't they know where it

201
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,300
sent him so this is where the rat people

202
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,249
congregate and get their human masks but

203
00:06:12,249 --> 00:06:13,569
it's got this on the door

204
00:06:13,569 --> 00:06:15,999
ever heard of subtlety house demons are

205
00:06:15,999 --> 00:06:18,249
formidable beings with a truly powerful

206
00:06:18,249 --> 00:06:20,529
psychic could override it too bad we

207
00:06:20,529 --> 00:06:22,120
didn't just put a lock somewhere so he

208
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,589
couldn't access the console in the first

209
00:06:23,589 --> 00:06:25,180
place but these house demons unionize

210
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:27,069
back in 76 and they're hard to terminate

211
00:06:27,069 --> 00:06:27,969
without going through years of

212
00:06:27,969 --> 00:06:30,699
bureaucracy and red tape mm-hmm advise

213
00:06:30,699 --> 00:06:34,419
you me boy shine as pure oh it sure is

214
00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:35,860
cool meeting all these new characters

215
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,330
that have abilities that are specific to

216
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:38,830
the plot and are not further explained

217
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,779
in any way whoa it's a shine strong

218
00:06:40,779 --> 00:06:42,819
enough to kill a demon movie definitely

219
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,439
ties into the shining which normally I

220
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:46,089
would celebrate but it really just makes

221
00:06:46,089 --> 00:06:47,879
me want to watch The Shining Sarah

222
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:50,379
didn't two skins have trouble with her

223
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:52,210
kid yesterday why is this information

224
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:53,469
just now getting the Walter King

225
00:06:53,469 --> 00:06:55,029
seriously the next scene will probably

226
00:06:55,029 --> 00:06:56,349
have a reference to misery then they'll

227
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:57,550
find a way to stick the shawshank

228
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:58,959
redemption' in here and if this movie is

229
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:00,459
just long enough maybe Christine will

230
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:02,409
make it by the what an amusement park be

231
00:07:02,409 --> 00:07:04,300
located out in the goddamn forest and if

232
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,709
the movies saying the world has moved on

233
00:07:05,709 --> 00:07:07,569
why is all this carnival still here

234
00:07:07,569 --> 00:07:09,249
relatively intact all these trees had

235
00:07:09,249 --> 00:07:10,659
time to grow but the marquee maintained

236
00:07:10,659 --> 00:07:13,180
its structure well and damn it kid you

237
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:15,249
had one job if you get murdered by feral

238
00:07:15,249 --> 00:07:16,870
inhabitants of a weird landscape it's on

239
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,219
you for not keeping the hell up with

240
00:07:18,219 --> 00:07:20,469
Roland so you fight him how's the fields

241
00:07:20,469 --> 00:07:22,539
covered with bodies in when we saw the

242
00:07:22,539 --> 00:07:24,370
field covered in bodies but Walter just

243
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:26,169
walked up and set a dude on fire

244
00:07:26,169 --> 00:07:27,490
damn it movie if you're gonna reference

245
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:28,959
something at least give us a proper King

246
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:30,610
reference such an honor to meet you in

247
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:33,129
person sir I'm sorry but does Walter

248
00:07:33,129 --> 00:07:34,389
seem like the kind of guy who tells his

249
00:07:34,389 --> 00:07:35,889
underlings hey let's go get a burger

250
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:38,680
when he needs information location it's

251
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,749
all in here magical whack job Walter

252
00:07:40,749 --> 00:07:42,789
needs a fucking dossier in order to find

253
00:07:42,789 --> 00:07:44,409
a child even though he's been shown to

254
00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:46,029
be pretty much omnipotent up until now

255
00:07:46,029 --> 00:07:48,909
outside his endless darkness full of

256
00:07:48,909 --> 00:07:51,249
demons thoughts of us it's hair down the

257
00:07:51,249 --> 00:07:53,589
tower when the tower falls he'll roar

258
00:07:53,589 --> 00:07:55,449
why does he need the demons to rule he's

259
00:07:55,449 --> 00:07:56,680
already shown that he can get into

260
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,120
people's heads and make them do what he

261
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,740
wants and what makes him so sure that he

262
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,089
can control the demons when they arrive

263
00:08:01,089 --> 00:08:02,829
what exactly this Walter actually want

264
00:08:02,829 --> 00:08:04,329
when he rules the universe what kind of

265
00:08:04,329 --> 00:08:05,680
life can he have then that he can't have

266
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,240
now

267
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,860
so how often are they taking shots at

268
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,300
the tower the last time this happened it

269
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,190
cost massive damage and these kids have

270
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,020
obviously been around for a while so the

271
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,250
tower should already be in putting

272
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,230
shambles if Roland has such a killin

273
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,820
boner for Walter why isn't he chasing

274
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,170
the source of the death ray which he can

275
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:22,730
clearly see and since it's happened at

276
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,080
least a few times before what the fuck's

277
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,780
taking him so long hey kiddo movie has a

278
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,670
discount contact moment that's even less

279
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:30,140
necessary than the actual contact

280
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:33,830
darkness and fire so Roland tells Jake

281
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,690
that every time the tower is hit a small

282
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:37,190
tear opens and the demons try to go

283
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:38,480
through it but how do they camouflage

284
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,979
the red barrier while they impersonate

285
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:41,600
Jake's dead dad this is still a

286
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,250
protective barrier created by the dark

287
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,870
tower correct and if this is just an

288
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,250
illusion for Jake then why doesn't roll

289
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,390
and see the barrier when he's looking

290
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:52,550
for Sonny got out if this small terror

291
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:54,320
happens every time then how come there

292
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,730
aren't actual demons on earth wreaking

293
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:57,530
havoc right now everybody's gonna be so

294
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:59,090
lucky to have rolling around unless this

295
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:00,830
movie's saying the demons only show up

296
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:02,960
on this planet so great it's chronic

297
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,790
because you've shot at it with a regular

298
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:07,280
s gun that's a shapeless demon it should

299
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,020
be boom you dat you firing at it moody

300
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,580
couldn't decide between dark and out of

301
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,110
the scene or massive amounts of cuts

302
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,790
that's the best strategy for obfuscating

303
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:16,760
it's CGI and said let's do both he

304
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,770
handled yourself well really what

305
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:20,360
impressed you the part when Jake didn't

306
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,920
pick up the gun or the part when he ran

307
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,570
around and almost got impaled several

308
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:25,280
times I hope you don't mind me making

309
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,410
myself at home where I come from we

310
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:28,970
don't have chicken and you really get

311
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:30,410
the sense Matthew McConaughey had no

312
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:32,180
clue about this character just trying a

313
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,350
different way to play Walter in every

314
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:35,060
scene also if this scenes being played

315
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,410
for laughs the movie hasn't set up

316
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,670
Walter to be this kind of comic relief

317
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:39,380
if he's doing this to lull Jake's

318
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,240
parents into thinking he's normal while

319
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,650
breaking in and cooking chicken doesn't

320
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:44,330
quite work if he's genuinely hungry and

321
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:45,710
wants to eat chicken why didn't he just

322
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,510
stopped by a KFC before he came here I'd

323
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,920
rather see the cliche where the bad guy

324
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,330
listen to classical music and what

325
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:52,340
Jake's stepdad says who are you Walter

326
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,300
could just hold up his index finger

327
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,950
indicating a good part is about to come

328
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:55,970
up and he'd rather not be interrupted

329
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,220
during it trying's but what about the

330
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,020
chicken you were putting spices on that

331
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:03,290
meal is going to burn the kilt you must

332
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:04,340
feel

333
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,890
not believing in him but she still

334
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:08,779
doesn't know all that was true right all

335
00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:10,460
Walters done is show up cook a chicken

336
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,320
and kill Jake stepdad so she's probably

337
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,760
really feeling more know away by the

338
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,230
breaking-and-entering than guilty I know

339
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:17,029
Rowan's tired and injured injured but

340
00:10:17,029 --> 00:10:18,770
there is no urgency by his character to

341
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:20,150
hunt and kill Walter the first half of

342
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,500
this movie is a lot of this sitting

343
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,150
around and doing nominal instead of

344
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,980
being singularly focused on that magical

345
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:27,290
bastard and do something where is this

346
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:30,020
child he's here on mid world if you

347
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,339
didn't know that before you left how do

348
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,540
you know that now are you telling me

349
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,310
that by walking into his room you got

350
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:36,140
some sort of psychic scent and if so why

351
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,430
couldn't you get that same scent when

352
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:38,360
you visited the house where he

353
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,460
transported the only way to access their

354
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,930
territories is from one of their own

355
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:44,270
bases goddamn this random small-town

356
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,710
seer sure does know a lot about the

357
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,300
inner workings of a cabal that's trying

358
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,680
to destroy the tower do they put out a

359
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,510
weekly press release does everyone else

360
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:52,760
as soon as it aligns it should open an

361
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,160
unobstructed barrier in your city on

362
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,990
your version of Earth aside from the

363
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,490
Pennywise thing is this the first time

364
00:10:58,490 --> 00:10:59,810
the movie has even acknowledged two

365
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:01,190
different versions of earth sure they

366
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:03,230
called earth Keystone Earth earlier but

367
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,520
there's never been one mention of a

368
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,170
version of Earth and how that works for

369
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:11,660
the whole movie I guess this first

370
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,220
assholes job was to stand there and look

371
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,870
intimidating so that the other asshole

372
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,130
can give this villager a proper

373
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:18,110
backstabbing Walter pulls a magic marble

374
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,550
out of his collection and puts it on a

375
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:21,320
thing which then gives him this B

376
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,730
hologram to watch do you think the fine

377
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:24,140
marble would translate into a picture

378
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,580
quality that's better than a vic-20

379
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,710
computer but you'd be wrong also why is

380
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:29,150
it Walter on this mission to capture the

381
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,860
KITT since Jake is so special you think

382
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,120
someone like Walter would want to be

383
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,200
dick in case anything goes wrong

384
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,730
especially considering what he believes

385
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,589
Jake is capable of hang on Walter's

386
00:11:36,589 --> 00:11:38,210
minions said they were gonna send our

387
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:40,310
trackers in the region sir boom I guess

388
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:41,810
we're on vacation and only pillagers

389
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:43,250
were available this attack started

390
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,930
without us knowing exactly who these rat

391
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:46,160
people are or anything about their

392
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,600
abilities we barely even know anything

393
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,920
about the people in this village who's

394
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,450
seen his dark moves around to multiple

395
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:52,160
locations and his flash edited to death

396
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,870
this movie itself is probably telling

397
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,400
the director get on to the next scene

398
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,430
already so have they fired the guy that

399
00:11:58,430 --> 00:11:59,780
suggested that the Dark Tower movie

400
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,130
should include a bunch of orcs punching

401
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:02,779
stringer Bell yet what are you doing

402
00:12:02,779 --> 00:12:05,959
quiet so wait he can't tune her out but

403
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:07,640
he can tune out all the other loud noise

404
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,020
that's going on around him so that he

405
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,360
can hear Jake's abductor running away

406
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,630
I like how this whole scene is

407
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:16,100
contingent upon Roland being able to

408
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,630
tune into Jake's frequency and being

409
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,370
able to sonar his abductors height from

410
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:21,079
100 yards away at the movie focused on

411
00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:22,490
Roland instead of trying to be the next

412
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:24,320
divergent mais potter wiii be able to

413
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,089
understand his abilities better as is

414
00:12:26,089 --> 00:12:27,470
the movie forces you to swallow how

415
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:29,120
impossible this shot is without a bit of

416
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,610
context come on Walter alerted all those

417
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:33,350
trackers where Jake was when he started

418
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:35,180
to shine which led to his capture in the

419
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,589
first place so why aren't the rest of

420
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,000
them attacking them right now when

421
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,990
they're walking through the middle of

422
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:42,620
the fucking village look I know they

423
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,209
fixed this thing using spare parts or

424
00:12:44,209 --> 00:12:45,920
something but before the attack it took

425
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,630
forever for this portal power up so

426
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:48,589
you're telling me that during this

427
00:12:48,589 --> 00:12:50,000
attack they were able to fix the machine

428
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,829
no problem and were able to power it up

429
00:12:51,829 --> 00:12:54,320
in record time I think they're gone but

430
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,399
Walter was watching the whole thing

431
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:57,800
unfold on his magic ball vision thing

432
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,149
did he just turn that off immediately

433
00:12:59,149 --> 00:13:01,070
after the first tracker picked up Jake I

434
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:02,720
see the eyes of all six are kicking in

435
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,550
apparently a stab wound from an evil

436
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,320
demon from the nothing will respond to

437
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,750
regular antibiotics what is this

438
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,839
sugar so is this a product on placement

439
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,120
or is it the unproductive how are you

440
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,190
gonna find the portal New York's a

441
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:17,600
pretty big place can't you just have a

442
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,130
vision about it there was no real rhyme

443
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:20,870
or reason as to why your shine gave you

444
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,250
a vision of the other one since it was

445
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,750
apparently a house run by Walter and his

446
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,310
minions so why hasn't it given you

447
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:28,269
directions to the new portal

448
00:13:28,269 --> 00:13:31,370
Keystone Earth all you have to do is

449
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:32,990
search an entire planet you're sure to

450
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:34,760
find Jake in a matter of hours I know I

451
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,060
know

452
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,649
New York is the base of operations on

453
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,209
earth but why is it the only one you're

454
00:13:38,209 --> 00:13:39,680
trying to cast this wide net to find

455
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,149
children with abilities and you narrow

456
00:13:41,149 --> 00:13:43,670
it down to just New York hey remember me

457
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,470
fancy that they found that homeless guy

458
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:47,570
from earlier one of the not even though

459
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:49,070
his vision comes in well after he

460
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:50,480
notices the ashes Jake somehow

461
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,100
immediately knows those ashes are his

462
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:55,459
mom this one he's tracking you Walter

463
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:56,899
has trackers all over the city

464
00:13:56,899 --> 00:13:58,459
but he has nobody at Jake's home address

465
00:13:58,459 --> 00:14:00,230
and he knows Jake and Roland are on

466
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:02,089
Keystone Earth so why isn't he already

467
00:14:02,089 --> 00:14:03,800
here god damn this movie and its

468
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,630
inability to logic what about the tower

469
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:07,279
funny the screenwriters asked this

470
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,600
question after realizing they'd written

471
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,730
75% of a Dark Tower movie that has very

472
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:13,519
little dark towering in it I am I look I

473
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,990
know New York City has its crime

474
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,760
problems but they're in lower fucking

475
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,410
Manhattan shooting incredibly loud guns

476
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:20,540
in a warehouse and nobody notices did

477
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,800
you miss me

478
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,300
so Walter is projecting himself inside

479
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,860
this gun store using one of his fancy

480
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,269
marbles if you can make a projection

481
00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:29,070
like this look so good why were the

482
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,839
images for the village attack a certain

483
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:34,699
shade of hologram puke-green fire away

484
00:14:34,699 --> 00:14:38,250
it's not me not doing this since when do

485
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,079
any other people Walter possesses know

486
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,459
that their actions are not their own and

487
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:43,079
considering the command why would he

488
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:44,579
stop to tell him this when everything in

489
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:45,690
his body should be compelling him to

490
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,430
repeatedly fire that gun at rolling Oh

491
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:49,410
so Walter his minions do employ

492
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:51,209
windowless vans for abductions why did

493
00:14:51,209 --> 00:14:54,660
they try that other method again damn

494
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,160
looks like Jake's got a super-high

495
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,019
midi-chlorian count of course no movie

496
00:14:58,019 --> 00:14:59,699
is complete without the everyone runs to

497
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:00,959
get their guns from the weapons Locker

498
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,300
scene I guess he's out of bullets then

499
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,100
and since when is the gunslinger the

500
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:05,880
Incredible Hulk

501
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,620
I know Roland is a badass gunslinger and

502
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,389
there's no way he's gonna die but there

503
00:15:09,389 --> 00:15:10,920
were a million henchmen all over the

504
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,540
place with automatic rifles and the fact

505
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,920
that they stopped shooting as soon as

506
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,660
Roland appears allowing him to take them

507
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,459
all out with two six-shooters takes me

508
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:19,050
right out of this can movie roland

509
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:20,819
briefly becomes Batman in the middle of

510
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:24,600
this fight was this asshole expecting to

511
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,260
happen now I have to put up with the non

512
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,959
comic-book movies

513
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:32,190
Roland not only survives this but the

514
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:34,769
bus driver continues to drive oh my god

515
00:15:34,769 --> 00:15:37,500
it's the kid he's keeping the portal

516
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,449
open keep in mind that jake has had very

517
00:15:39,449 --> 00:15:41,040
little chance to hone his shining skills

518
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,720
but sure he can keep the portal open

519
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,819
using only his mine I thought shine was

520
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:46,769
more psychic than telekinetic but it's a

521
00:15:46,769 --> 00:15:48,420
movie so I should really just relax I

522
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,279
guess also wow that magical

523
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:52,110
technological doohickey that focuses the

524
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,699
kids power sure is handy for also

525
00:15:53,699 --> 00:15:55,199
telling you who's keeping a portal open

526
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:59,319
this movie

527
00:15:59,319 --> 00:16:01,369
Rowland does not shooter aim with his

528
00:16:01,369 --> 00:16:03,049
hand nor does he kill with his gun

529
00:16:03,049 --> 00:16:04,759
because something something is Father's

530
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:06,379
face so how come the bullets are hitting

531
00:16:06,379 --> 00:16:08,119
rocks and not the spaces between the

532
00:16:08,119 --> 00:16:09,859
rocks I mean this is a cool sift trick

533
00:16:09,859 --> 00:16:11,449
being played by Walter but it has about

534
00:16:11,449 --> 00:16:13,100
an 85 percent chance of putting this all

535
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,319
up

536
00:16:14,319 --> 00:16:17,029
also Darth Watterson Louie makes it seem

537
00:16:17,029 --> 00:16:17,929
like this would be any worse than

538
00:16:17,929 --> 00:16:19,459
crashing through a window and falling a

539
00:16:19,459 --> 00:16:20,869
couple stories into a bus which is

540
00:16:20,869 --> 00:16:22,069
something that definitely happened two

541
00:16:22,069 --> 00:16:22,699
minutes ago

542
00:16:22,699 --> 00:16:25,459
anyway Roland survives us to kill this

543
00:16:25,459 --> 00:16:28,489
Mike on during this long long long

544
00:16:28,489 --> 00:16:30,350
gunslingers creed scene Walther

545
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:31,669
apparently can't walk 20 feet to

546
00:16:31,669 --> 00:16:37,489
officially end roll it wait does

547
00:16:37,489 --> 00:16:39,049
reciting the gunslinger creed make the

548
00:16:39,049 --> 00:16:40,519
second bullet travel faster than the

549
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:41,869
first bullet when your facility is

550
00:16:41,869 --> 00:16:43,489
primed to explode just because the mind

551
00:16:43,489 --> 00:16:45,259
control machine takes a bullet you chose

552
00:16:45,259 --> 00:16:51,499
the wrong architect so I guess all those

553
00:16:51,499 --> 00:16:52,879
children that were living in the village

554
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:54,529
directly next to this exploding building

555
00:16:54,529 --> 00:16:55,879
or dead in this happy ending

556
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:57,769
don't you come with me you have nothing

557
00:16:57,769 --> 00:17:00,079
here stuff man I know his mom's dead and

558
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,999
all but Jake still has like grandparents

559
00:17:01,999 --> 00:17:03,439
and aunts and uncles and friends and

560
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,059
maybe at least stop by the apartment to

561
00:17:05,059 --> 00:17:10,199
get his toothbrush

562
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:12,789

563
00:17:12,789 --> 00:17:14,350

566
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:31,580

567

[Applause]

576
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,910
you see her eating broken body soaked in

577
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:07,540
her blood

578
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:17,020
now how imagine she's white immediately

579
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:20,580
regret this decision

580
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:25,000
let the heat flow through you
