1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:08,090
[Music]

2
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:10,889
Jesus even the DreamWorks logo shows the

3
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:12,630
cruel kidnapping of the poor moon Fisher

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,280
this movie is unexpectedly terrifying

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,010
today is best day ever

6
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,430
alien narration I am oh i has been given

7
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:24,449
this name by my many many friends later

8
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:26,010
Oh we'll admit that he doesn't know why

9
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,170
they say oh when he shows up by the car

10
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,670
people universally saying oh when he

11
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:38,000
shows up why isn't his name oh please

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,680
this goes on for some time we are safe

13
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,469
from our enemy that go captain smek not

14
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:44,700
only shows an example of their sworn

15
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,620
enemy to the boov crowd he blows it way

16
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,329
the hell up and animates it for full

17
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:50,219
terror value this planet is full of

18
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:51,690
great stuff

19
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:54,570
look at these delicious fruits why did

20
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,100
you assume the footballs were fruits I

21
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,660
mean you obviously robbed a Walmart to

22
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:58,980
bring this many back with you so why

23
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,210
didn't you also take baseballs and

24
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:01,980
soccer balls and I guess you found one

25
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,000
of those Walmart's that doesn't pay

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,500
attention to tiny aliens wheeling out a

27
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,939
whole cart of footballs without pain

28
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:07,380
also the captain starts this

29
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:08,820
demonstration now right when they're

30
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,439
within distance of the planet meaning

31
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:11,520
the boov did not know where they were

32
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,130
going or why until now that makes me

33
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:16,439
feel so good it takes all three fifteen

34
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:17,970
minutes for this kids movie to go right

35
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:19,290
for the potty humor Jesus even

36
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:20,820
Despicable Me had more restraint and

37
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,530
that thing had a fucking firk gun

38
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,890
what fun at a party boov do not party so

39
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,630
the boov are the anti trolls which I'm

40
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:28,979
guessing is how that movie ended up

41
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:30,810
getting me dreamworks said hey you know

42
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:32,880
that movie home we did in 2015 let's do

43
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,380
the exact same movie only with creatures

44
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,340
who love to party

45
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,350
complimentary BJ's for everyone the moon

46
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:38,729
turned off the Earth's gravity all at

47
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:40,259
once but some things start floating

48
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:41,970
faster than others this guy gets a hole

49
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:43,170
cut into his bathroom while he's

50
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,909
showering but apparently he's safe as

51
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:45,780
long as he's in the shower

52
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:46,920
because he doesn't get evacuated

53
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,930
immediately like everyone else does also

54
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:50,399
this evacuation would definitely miss a

55
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:51,780
heaping portion of the world and it

56
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,369
looks inefficient as I know the balloons

57
00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:55,140
are expert colonizers and everything but

58
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,579
they're not city planners for humans

59
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:57,810
right how did they get all these fucking

60
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,369
houses and know where to plant the trees

61
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,380
and even though the city looks huge they

62
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,420
captured everyone in the world sure you

63
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,740
can technically fit the entire human

64
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,180
population in a place the size of New

65
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,560
York City and all but that's standing

66
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,910
right next to each other these people

67
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,560
have individual houses also if they

68
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,640
gathered up all the people in the world

69
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,740
what happens to like the Eskimos or

70
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,150
we live in the jungle they're supposed

71
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,380
to immediately adapt to using a

72
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,850
microwave and having a two-car garage

73
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:19,830
and that also means all of your warlords

74
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:21,360
Psychopaths and dickheads are randomly

75
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,040
living next door to decent families this

76
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,590
planet may be a bit of a fixing it up er

77
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,450
yeah but it's got the same breathable

78
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:28,890
atmosphere as you have back at your last

79
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:30,780
place which is super goddamn convenient

80
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,730
also the boov landed on this planet five

81
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,440
seconds ago yet hundreds have decided to

82
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,450
walk into laundromats and nail salons to

83
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,310
amp up the hilarity this shot suggests

84
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,810
that there are just as many bicycles in

85
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:41,490
this city as there are toilets and that

86
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,110
grand pianos are anywhere near both of

87
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,610
those items it also suggests that

88
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:46,290
DreamWorks is incapable making a movie

89
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,880
without toilet humor also these toilets

90
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,380
from a huge city are all being removed

91
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,000
at the same time but are all perfectly

92
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
empty and clean these guys told what

93
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,280
sector 179 is they just found out what

94
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,330
planet they were going to about two

95
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:02,040
minutes ago they explained to everyone

96
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,270
where they needed to go all around the

97
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,500
world feel like this movie could have

98
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,610
been better if it didn't try to condense

99
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:07,170
the evacuation and repopulation of the

100
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:08,010
earth in six minutes

101
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:11,370
welcome home neighbours boov do not have

102
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:14,430
neighbors these assholes reproduce they

103
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,570
don't party they don't have neighbors

104
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,490
they always run away from things I'm

105
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:18,510
gonna guess it's some kind of spawn

106
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,070
reproduction but that's entirely a guess

107
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,690
whoever lived out here put a cook book

108
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:23,130
with a bunch of science books one of

109
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:24,330
these things is not like the other one

110
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:25,710
of these things just doesn't belong only

111
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,240
both on a brushing his teeth by the

112
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,650
toilet here since they were all floating

113
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,180
into space the last time we looked this

114
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,370
one cats here there should be a ton of

115
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,200
others especially in the big city and if

116
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,910
they took the pets too wide this asshole

117
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,350
get left behind is this Kirk Cameron's

118
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,340
cat sorry

119
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,130
mom's not here Casper do you mean the

120
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:42,900
evacuation technology wasn't 100%

121
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:43,320
foolproof

122
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,510
we've just got here I mean they're still

123
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:47,340
moving in and everything so how did tip

124
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,750
have enough time to not only set up her

125
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,340
hideaway here but create all this anti

126
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,030
boo propaganda tip set up this Rube

127
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,500
Goldberg contraption in case someone

128
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,090
came by instead of an alarm or something

129
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:58,560
that could actually combat one of these

130
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,010
assholes

131
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:01,230
well this explains how cartoon riri can

132
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:02,670
reach the gas and brake pedals it does

133
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:04,080
not explain how she can see over the

134
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,820
dashboard also as we're about to see the

135
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,620
streets are filled with boob walking

136
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,270
around but somehow tip will be able to

137
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:10,950
avoid all that business and not be seen

138
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:14,880
driving around ever hello Jesus Christ

139
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,220
we get it nobody like so if he were this

140
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,750
toxic why didn't they just leave him at

141
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,180
the last place because I'm not allowed

142
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:24,030
to move you're always saying the funny

143
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:24,750
things

144
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,430
why is oh the only one that consistently

145
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,360
talks like this

146
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,319
I know we supposed to be weird and

147
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:29,759
offensive to the boov but there's no

148
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,710
reason why he always talks how we think

149
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,180
an alien should talk and the others just

150
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,199
occasionally do it

151
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:36,210
parties are useless and take a valuable

152
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:38,969
booth time what these assholes do that

153
00:04:38,969 --> 00:04:40,889
require any time whatsoever what are

154
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:43,469
these things okay I shall send an evite

155
00:04:43,469 --> 00:04:45,780
to you so you can join later god damn it

156
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,129
it's like the screenwriters wanted to

157
00:04:47,129 --> 00:04:48,689
combine a fish outta water story with an

158
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:50,520
alien story using dialogues I think

159
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,919
Millennials actually use invite has been

160
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:57,900
sent to entire galaxy will receive how

161
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,029
you mean the boov and the cord use the

162
00:05:00,029 --> 00:05:01,529
same emailing system or whatever the

163
00:05:01,529 --> 00:05:03,120
this is just a lazy way to stir up

164
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,889
conflict and how many boov accidentally

165
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:06,300
hit that send all button out of the

166
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,620
billions of the Oh can't be the only

167
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,389
dumbass alien in their population right

168
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:10,860
and you don't even have to be a dumbass

169
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,870
to make this mistake you are a fugitive

170
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:15,449
boov initiating self-destruct

171
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:17,310
nope just take him to jail instead of

172
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,930
simply blowing up his ride the abduction

173
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:20,279
of the entire human race took a couple

174
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:22,110
minutes and the boov rounded everyone up

175
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,879
with no problem they can't locate one of

176
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:25,349
their own kind that's right next to them

177
00:05:25,349 --> 00:05:27,029
guess the little suction thing missed

178
00:05:27,029 --> 00:05:28,620
the spike when it considered all bikes

179
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,460
useless despite being on the open you

180
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,569
know for a girl that's trying to escape

181
00:05:33,569 --> 00:05:35,550
the alien hordes and find her mother tip

182
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,020
sure is taking her sweet ass time at

183
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:40,650
this market life-form detected not human

184
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:42,659
mother this is how these things operate

185
00:05:42,659 --> 00:05:43,770
there'd be at least a million more

186
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:45,240
people like tip that we're accidentally

187
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,860
holding their pet and movie doesn't even

188
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:50,789
alien right I want ideas movie

189
00:05:50,789 --> 00:05:52,349
completely wastes of vocal performance

190
00:05:52,349 --> 00:05:53,759
from Steve Martin that's at least trying

191
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,259
to go forward he doesn't do many movies

192
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:56,520
these days people so we need to make

193
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,620
them count you are all invited to a

194
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,139
party just head to the Milky Way turn

195
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:02,909
right at the Big Dipper third planet

196
00:06:02,909 --> 00:06:04,979
from the Sun if O's invite was intended

197
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:06,719
for all the boov who are on earth then

198
00:06:06,719 --> 00:06:08,069
when I had a did he include these

199
00:06:08,069 --> 00:06:09,599
directions at first the problem was

200
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:11,250
explained to us that because a sent the

201
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,839
invitation the core would be able to

202
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,039
track them down just because of the

203
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:15,360
signal or whatever so why did everyone

204
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,860
freak out at first if they didn't know

205
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,599
what the invitation actually said if a

206
00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:20,069
sends an invite that makes any sense

207
00:06:20,069 --> 00:06:21,839
then it doesn't matter if the gorg got

208
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:22,199
it or not

209
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:24,389
also Oh didn't have the idea to send the

210
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:26,069
evite out until he talked to Kyle at the

211
00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:27,389
crosswalk which means he did a

212
00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:28,770
tremendous amount of recording and

213
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:30,210
editing for this invitation within

214
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:32,520
roughly six seconds I am putting you in

215
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,650
charge which has anyone been in charge I

216
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,419
mean those just hanging out in a market

217
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:37,949
that's nearby to where the chase began

218
00:06:37,949 --> 00:06:39,539
in the first place who B can't decide if

219
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:41,730
these boobs or genius trackers or

220
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:43,320
Oh repairs tips car and some kind of

221
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,330
weird booby and pick my ride fashion and

222
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:46,590
it takes up a lot of the movies runtime

223
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,090
tip seemed surprised and all the weird

224
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:49,920
renovations but what was she doing while

225
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,940
he was taking all the stuff out of the

226
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,200
convenience store this seems like

227
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,250
something that might have been funnier

228
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,050
if we actually got to see him do it and

229
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:56,520
explain it to her while I was doing it

230
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,330
but hilarious car guy yo what did I say

231
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:01,290
interrupt his home movie to bring you an

232
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:02,940
episode of Tom and Jerry I guess there's

233
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,680
no way that this easily seen car will be

234
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,820
detected in their flight from New York

235
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,710
to Paris okay seriously moving what's

236
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:09,150
the timeline here because it's still the

237
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:10,260
same night the children and Rihanna

238
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,420
escaped twice then the grand pooh-bah

239
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,580
did his world broadcast then the boogly

240
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:15,840
started looking for them in the same

241
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,360
place after Oh had fixed the car so when

242
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,580
did I have time to install a goddamn hot

243
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,200
dog machine in the car you just have

244
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,020
pets for fun and companionship

245
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,430
Rihanna's performance here makes her

246
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:27,750
role in battleship look better and

247
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:32,610
better each minute this is a funny gag

248
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:34,650
but why was the seat already set on the

249
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:36,180
very back setting especially since

250
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,410
they've been lined up perfectly until

251
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:41,790
now huh this move gets security cam

252
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:42,960
footage from the store that somehow

253
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,940
tracked the pimped-out cars that sped

254
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,650
miles away from the cameras reach you

255
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:48,120
guys had summer in the Statue of Liberty

256
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,130
statue of smack neglecting that this

257
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:52,290
happened in one day why the is the

258
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:53,640
statue of smack out in the middle of

259
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,490
nowhere I too has to break pee or as you

260
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:58,500
calls it the number one when did I ever

261
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,540
find out that humans called pee a number

262
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,190
one unless tip somehow mentioned it

263
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,510
somewhere during the trip I find it very

264
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:04,890
hard to believe that she did what a

265
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:06,150
convenient way to get the movie into

266
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:10,839
bath um humor again

267
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:13,249
the bathroom humor isn't stale at all

268
00:08:13,249 --> 00:08:15,319
but let me ask you this how does eating

269
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:17,029
a urinal cake register as a bad taste to

270
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:18,889
him we saw this mother for brushing his

271
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:23,479
teeth using toilet water earlier should

272
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:25,009
I send the continued gross out bathroom

273
00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:26,539
humor or the fact that there are still

274
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:27,949
toilets around after we were told they

275
00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:29,209
were useless and floating into the sky

276
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:31,189
earlier also these people apparently eat

277
00:08:31,189 --> 00:08:33,139
inanimate objects for food yet they

278
00:08:33,139 --> 00:08:34,849
totally know what lemonade is pick a

279
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:38,000
lane movie Oh Kyle not only isn't

280
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,319
traveling with any other boobs for

281
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:39,740
backup

282
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,870
he doesn't radio in at all as soon as he

283
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:47,360
sees the car turn 3 I Do's not I pump I

284
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,949
was been living with the other booze all

285
00:08:48,949 --> 00:08:50,660
his life and would absolutely know about

286
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:54,910
the whole turn green once you liable

287
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:59,240
I'll just open with this Kyle survives

288
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,800
this I guess the boob didn't care enough

289
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,209
about that giant explosion at the gas

290
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:03,620
station to actually send a unit from

291
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,389
their search patrol you have tricked me

292
00:09:05,389 --> 00:09:07,370
into listening to a debilitating sonic

293
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:09,290
weapon Oh thinks this is bad wait till

294
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:10,339

296
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,420

helped gym person responded when he

300
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,879
asked how much longer this stupid-ass

301
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:26,569
scene lasted not to belabor the you know

302
00:09:26,569 --> 00:09:28,040
what I am belaboring the point

303
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,209
this motherfucker does everything

304
00:09:29,209 --> 00:09:30,680
different from all the other boov key

305
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,209
witness dance scene which was only made

306
00:09:32,209 --> 00:09:34,160
to sell soundtracks anyway I see Steven

307
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,600
Spielberg was on hand to animate the

308
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,300
shot moments ago you are kicking on me

309
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,939
and yelling which is seeming more to be

310
00:09:40,939 --> 00:09:43,670
mad than sad Oh whose Ray's change

311
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,680
colors all the time do their emotions

312
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,059
somehow did not realize there are

313
00:09:47,059 --> 00:09:48,290
multiple emotions you can have at once

314
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:50,959
please come on I need ideas this story

315
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,610
is so bare that the screenwriters margin

316
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:54,439
notes made it into the actual script we

317
00:09:54,439 --> 00:09:57,589
has a rule nine mistakes and you are out

318
00:09:57,589 --> 00:10:00,829
how many mistakes do you have sixty to

319
00:10:00,829 --> 00:10:03,559
sixty doing mistakes if the boov are

320
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:05,029
supposed to be the stoic on feeling

321
00:10:05,029 --> 00:10:06,559
alien race why would they have allowed

322
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:08,360
Oh to stick around for so long everyone

323
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,740
clearly hates him and he contributes

324
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,420
nothing to their society they somehow

325
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,639
flew this car into goddamn Paris boov

326
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:15,500
headquarters without anyone noticing I

327
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,179
thought the big brain boovs would have

328
00:10:17,179 --> 00:10:19,459
stopped my invitation by now if I could

329
00:10:19,459 --> 00:10:20,809
think of the idea of stopping his

330
00:10:20,809 --> 00:10:21,920
invitation which is

331
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,050
what the big brain boobs figured out why

332
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:25,850
didn't oh stop the invitation itself why

333
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:27,200
did the entire race of boov panic when

334
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,250
they found out the invitation was sent

335
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,630
out when it's apparently easy to stop

336
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,070
the invitation I shall input my password

337
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:33,680
oh and his super long password in like

338
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,750
four seconds but after a caps lock joke

339
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,639
gone wrong it later takes him like

340
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:39,320
totally forever in a race against the

341
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,760
clock to enter it complete with all the

342
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,350
bull to race against the clock usually

343
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,570
implies in a movie but I would not but

344
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:46,490
you might but I would not buy side

345
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:47,600
effects of watching this movie may

346
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,160
include brain leakage homicidal thoughts

347
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,110
pancreatic discomfort temporary rage

348
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:52,550
blindness impotence forgetting where

349
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:54,470
your keys are facepalm injury incessant

350
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:56,750
SMD aging and a deep desire to chug

351
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:00,230
bleach but do it all slow like so I can

352
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:02,000
finish jerking off the funny thing gets

353
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,070
that close to someone's eye cliche also

354
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,149
a movie makes the tip of the Eiffel

355
00:11:05,149 --> 00:11:06,560
Tower and look like a super sharp spear

356
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,389
instead of the actual radio tower that's

357
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:10,279
on top of it because all we really care

358
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:11,720
about is watching aliens Steve Martin

359
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,790
sort out his B material I can't wait to

360
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:16,010
tell mom I actually went to Paris yeah I

361
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,209
shall have a lot of fun telling that

362
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:18,649
story to the rest of the enslaved human

363
00:11:18,649 --> 00:11:19,070
race

364
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:20,600
none of the super annoyed and extremely

365
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,010
mobile boov think to follow the one

366
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:23,899
human and car that just kept their home

367
00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:26,779
base it is possible I will continue

368
00:11:26,779 --> 00:11:28,640
making hilarious mistakes

369
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,380
I've watched 52 minutes of this movie if

370
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,670
it makes you feel any better I don't

371
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,019
think you've made one hilarious mistake

372
00:11:33,019 --> 00:11:35,660
yet I know when the other boobs said oh

373
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,550
they were not happy to see me

374
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,199
expositional roadtrip bonding cliche

375
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:40,880
this whole me and someone was living in

376
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,500
this mountain top made of completely

377
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:48,949
rock just let that sink in gorg the gorg

378
00:11:48,949 --> 00:11:50,660
are apparently into dubstep which is an

379
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:56,839
easy indicator of their evilness yeah

380
00:11:56,839 --> 00:11:58,100
it's the Shusher that was described

381
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,690
earlier in the movie but my question is

382
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:00,980
if the gorg can locate the Shusher

383
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,240
because of some sort of signal of the

384
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,649
myths why can't they just always follow

385
00:12:03,649 --> 00:12:04,579
wherever it goes

386
00:12:04,579 --> 00:12:06,319
instead the gorg week just long enough

387
00:12:06,319 --> 00:12:11,120
so that this can be blamed on it this

388
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,490
works I will now sing the boov deaths on

389
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:18,170
probability of success oh how I wish the

390
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,760
paying movie-going public said the same

391
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,839
thing to this rookie movie

392
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:23,300
it is gorg superchip how does oh no this

393
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,399
and why is he so good at fixing parently

394
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:26,630
emerging technologies from different

395
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:28,399
alien breeds ah see a mechanic back in

396
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:29,930
boo Ville movie leah has time for a

397
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:31,490
makeup montage apparently ain't got time

398
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:35,300
to explain that that's a lot of people

399
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,709
it still not nearly the amount of people

400
00:12:36,709 --> 00:12:38,480
this movie thinks it is also apparently

401
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,829
they've been peacefully enslaved for at

402
00:12:39,829 --> 00:12:41,360
least several days here without any hint

403
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,980
of an uprising against this unarmed and

404
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:47,240
incompetent boob population in the midst

405
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,910
of 7.3 billion people tip eagle-eyes the

406
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,709
exact location of her mother she's got

407
00:12:51,709 --> 00:12:53,089
some fancy zoom and enhance contact

408
00:12:53,089 --> 00:12:55,339
lenses the one mother ship will be here

409
00:12:55,339 --> 00:12:55,880
soon

410
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,470
I know Oh doesn't know and what the gorg

411
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:59,600
are really after but if the gorg get to

412
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,920
earth and find that their sworn enemies

413
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,810
have gone why would they could about the

414
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:04,160
planet the only thing that keeps them

415
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,930
going is the stone fueled boov hunt and

416
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:07,490
rage boner I know they're busy escaping

417
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:08,779
the gorg here but nobody at least

418
00:13:08,779 --> 00:13:10,399
recognizes the fugitive boov whose

419
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:11,990
picture was plastered all over the world

420
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:14,079
for the last several days

421
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:16,339
this magic super chip can simply be

422
00:13:16,339 --> 00:13:18,260
inserted into anything man it makes that

423
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:20,060
thing better despite being incompatible

424
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,470
with probably anything except gorg

425
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:23,240
hardware but there are like a million

426
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,160
ways to design a spaceship so why does

427
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,569
everything have to look like a discount

428
00:13:26,569 --> 00:13:28,399
Death Star okay so the boov are on the

429
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,110
run and it's great oh stuff that thing

430
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,790
in the hoo-ha and make it work but the

431
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:33,560
gorg have a lot more of those things

432
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,790
right it should be able to I don't run

433
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,319
them in no time flat and finish off this

434
00:13:36,319 --> 00:13:38,870
boov aside we need a new captain I

435
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:41,449
thinks it should be OH

436
00:13:41,449 --> 00:13:43,310
Kyle way overestimates owes

437
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:44,870
qualifications based on the slightest

438
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:45,500
bit of evidence

439
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,850
mere minutes after everyone hated him

440
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:48,079
for all the stupid mistakes he's ever

441
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:49,490
made he also takes charge of this

442
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:50,870
situation and guesses everyone else

443
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,339
feels the same way based on the same

444
00:13:52,339 --> 00:13:54,649
evidence you are not the only boov who

445
00:13:54,649 --> 00:13:57,350
makes mistake my mistake is not being

446
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:03,380
your friend oh please Oh captain Oh was

447
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,640
this directed by Francis Ford Coppola

448
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,730
wait

449
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:09,920
remember Jesus this movie has more

450
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,180
unnecessary songs in it than the

451
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,649
live-action Beauty and the Beast remake

452
00:14:12,649 --> 00:14:14,720
sure nobody seen the hot mom who's been

453
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,889
looking for her daughter this whole time

454
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:17,720
tip travels from New York to Paris then

455
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,100
to Australia where she knows the entire

456
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,600
world's population is located and

457
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,949
searches for 3 minutes for her mother

458
00:14:21,949 --> 00:14:23,389
then promptly gives up just like these

459
00:14:23,389 --> 00:14:25,009
boobs are doing more celebrating the new

460
00:14:25,009 --> 00:14:26,540
Campton than they are continuing to

461
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,009
evade the closely trailing mass of

462
00:14:28,009 --> 00:14:30,980
heavily-armed sworn enemies

463
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,870
neither can i considering the gorg was

464
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:34,279
literally right on their tail but

465
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:35,870
somehow the boov ship gave them a Juke

466
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,430
move on the way back to earth then land

467
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:39,170
it then Oh was able to find tip inside

468
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,879
this mass of humanity none of whom beat

469
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:41,899
him to death for being one of their

470
00:14:41,899 --> 00:14:43,670
alien oppressors all the people talking

471
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:45,560
to tips mom peel away and dramatic I

472
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:49,610
finally found my mom fashion what does

473
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:51,199
breaking the key in a lock do don't they

474
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:52,129
have buttons inside the car that

475
00:14:52,129 --> 00:14:54,199
automatically unlock the door and even

476
00:14:54,199 --> 00:14:55,459
if somehow breaking the key off in this

477
00:14:55,459 --> 00:14:56,959
particular lock made it impossible to

478
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,699
unlock the driver's side the passenger

479
00:14:58,699 --> 00:15:00,889
side is still okay to go right also what

480
00:15:00,889 --> 00:15:02,329
does ou expect to happen if he dies in

481
00:15:02,329 --> 00:15:03,920
this scenario he just stranded his

482
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,750
friend and her mom in a car in midair

483
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:06,920
and expected them to figure out how to

484
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:11,120
get down and somehow it will create a

485
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,560
giant force awakens' rift in the ground

486
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,329
trap oh and won't be able to stop its

487
00:15:14,329 --> 00:15:15,620
momentum so that this movie can have

488
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,480
five extra minutes of bolt you were

489
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,139
scared I almost made a number three not

490
00:15:21,139 --> 00:15:23,360
too hard it is still a possibility and

491
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,639
we're back in our lane now movie thanks

492
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:27,139
for your correction even though the gorg

493
00:15:27,139 --> 00:15:28,670
have been shown not to be the bad guys

494
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,319
he still has spikes and skulls on his

495
00:15:30,319 --> 00:15:31,819
body so he ain't completely innocent

496
00:15:31,819 --> 00:15:34,850
what was in that thing it is entire next

497
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:37,279
generation all of them remember this

498
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:38,449
rock was just sitting in the gorgs

499
00:15:38,449 --> 00:15:40,040
office on a pedestal that's where the

500
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,870
gorg keep their entire generation just

501
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:43,189
sitting out in the open easily knocked

502
00:15:43,189 --> 00:15:44,660
over I was always told not to put all

503
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,610
your children in one basket also holy

504
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:48,529
for most of this movie Captain smek has

505
00:15:48,529 --> 00:15:50,449
enslaved two species somebody get him

506
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,670
try it immediately for Warcraft what's a

507
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:55,970
he's a DJ apparently that gorg is last

508
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:57,529
gorg seems like it could have sent a

509
00:15:57,529 --> 00:15:59,000
message out to the boov that his only

510
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,740
remaining children are in that rock but

511
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,029
their captain carried around and we

512
00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:03,230
wouldn't have needed this movie to help

513
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:05,449
him get it back what do I know - King

514
00:16:05,449 --> 00:16:07,040
weeks later and everything is back to

515
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:07,430
normal

516
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:08,899
Grice this movie should just go ahead

517
00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:10,670
and admit it exists in a timeless King

518
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,290
wormhole I guess it's supposed to be

519
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:14,240
funny that this big brain boob is still

520
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,980
playing dead after all this time but I

521
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,329
don't find funny is that someone had to

522
00:16:17,329 --> 00:16:18,769
carry this move around so that it could

523
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,070
play dead everywhere it went

524
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:22,260
what is happening to my vine and instead

525
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,550
of any satisfying characterological

526
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:25,170
discoveries for the final part of the

527
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:27,540
movie we get another dance sequence with

528
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:30,360
a Rihanna song he has a new start in a

529
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,320
new home and now everyday is best day

530
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,630

531
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:37,800
