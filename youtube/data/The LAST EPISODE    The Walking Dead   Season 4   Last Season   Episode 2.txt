okay it's time everybody episode 2 is

2
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:07,350
out it kind of feels more real somehow

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,769
now that we know for sure this is it I

4
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:12,809
mean it was called the final episode but

5
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:16,619
now we know they ain't coming back boy I

6
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:18,570
can't click on it this is great

7
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:25,980
Oh what no just click on it what is

8
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:35,940
happening oh I think they're good you're

9
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,530
watching the light right let's play this

10
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,469
there's no G to watching yes for a long

11
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:45,289
time for some place we could call home

12
00:00:45,289 --> 00:00:47,579
just when we thought we'd found a huge

13
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:53,030
stash of food it turned out to be a trap

14
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:59,100
that could have been the end

15
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,039
but I woke up and found I've been saved

16
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,960
by a guy named Marlin living inside an

17
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,250
old boarding school it felt like a

18
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:17,909
chance at having a home a real one we

19
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:19,860
had to go back to the train station to

20
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,149
see if any food survived the explosion

21
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:28,190
but someone else had the same idea I

22
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:31,860
didn't want to risk it so I let him take

23
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:35,190
some of the food and leave I found

24
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:36,810
Marlin and Brody in the basement that

25
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:39,060
night arguing about the man we'd seen

26
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,490
and I learned why Brody was yeah

27
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:44,100
everything just went to thank you

28
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,860
the man was brave of raiders they'd run

29
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,259
into a year ago Marlin traded

30
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:51,210
Tennessee's older sisters to the Raiders

31
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:55,280
to keep himself safe

32
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,319
he attacked Brody and locked me in the

33
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:02,729
basement with her and she turned I had

34
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:04,370
to stop her

35
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:06,800
Marland stole a G's gun and tried to

36
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,250
convince them I had murdered Brodie not

37
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,560
cool that was really me

38
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,950
violet backed me up with everyone

39
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:17,780
against him remember I went out of

40
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:20,780
marlin I told him he could stay but he

41
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:24,860
couldn't be our leader but then it

42
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:28,820
didn't matter like hotel games and AJ

43
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,370
pulled the trigger he remembered what I

44
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:35,210
taught him how he remembered huh do you

45

167
00:09:58,539 --> 00:10:00,899
courtroom that's how it works

168
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:06,459
worked before back then it was about

169
00:10:06,459 --> 00:10:11,109
who's innocent who's guilty okay find us

170

171
00:10:14,529 --> 00:10:17,049
the trials happen you appear before a

172
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:20,979
judge there are no more judges I guess

173

176
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,679
later together sure after the funeral

177
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:36,999

head open

447
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:09,810
you ever seen old fruit explode after

448
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:12,090

449
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:17,360
how it'll look

450
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:24,920

00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:34,850
hi my name is Lily you see the one from

453
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:38,030
there no wait what you probably don't

454
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:41,030
remember me I think I recognize her Lily

455
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:46,370
I thought you died I see I don't even I

456
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:54,820
barely remember the hell not now

457
00:29:54,820 --> 00:30:00,080
fuck is this

458
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:09,220
from season two right Lee isn't with you

459
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:17,470
oh wow sorry sorry I got a Google you

460
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:19,150
know what we shouldn't just kick you out

461
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,880
we should hear what everybody know is

462
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:26,830
that Lilly is that the Lilly no bitch

463
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:30,750
don't you let's go no no freakin way

464
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:33,520
the fact that someone died everyone

465
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,710
ignores the fact that someone died is

466
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:37,840
that Lilly will return how two percent

467
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,440
confirmed well you confirm it buddy

468
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,540
it's the same it's the same concept as

469
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:46,210
well she's a murderer she's shot at a

470
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:49,180
random ah that's pretty clever I like it

471
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,820
he's dead dead is that really her she

472
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:54,550
looks so different she looks so

473
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:56,290
different like Lilly looked kind of

474
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:57,880
pretty like she was one of the I mean

475
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,740
it's kind of weird for me to say I mean

476
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:02,200
come on I mean you know what I mean

477
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:06,520
that is her holy cow do you guys

478
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:10,060
remember I thought I could use her from

479
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,230
someone else's season too

480
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:15,100
man that's crazy and I was complaining

481
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:17,260
like they made him keep anyway I'll

482
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:19,330
never forget him leaving me on the side

483
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:22,929
of the road to die I don't blame him

484
00:31:22,929 --> 00:31:24,489
I was clearly a threat to the group

485
00:31:24,489 --> 00:31:26,049
after I shot that girl

486
00:31:26,049 --> 00:31:29,259
harlot it's funny yeah you shot Carl

487
00:31:29,259 --> 00:31:31,570
should have left you behind - might have

488
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:34,749
lived longer if he did same thing will

489
00:31:34,749 --> 00:31:37,830
happen to you if you repeat his mistakes

490
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:40,719
your little boy there and died

491
00:31:40,719 --> 00:31:42,350

657
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:01,430
obvious choice isn't it you can just

658
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:05,369
they won't attack you right as long as

00:50:37,089 --> 00:50:41,920

707
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:44,080

00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:36,970

724
00:51:36,970 --> 00:51:40,150
Motor Inn survived really awful shit

728
00:51:51,070 --> 00:51:52,540
them down during an argument

729
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:55,390
Carly was her name she refused to let

730
00:51:55,390 --> 00:51:57,880
Lily push her around he was right about

731
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:00,070
darling I haven't seen Lily sense I

732
00:52:00,070 --> 00:52:04,630
believe you but there's something else

733
00:52:04,630 --> 00:52:07,000
well he said someone was with you at the

734
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,589
gates James

735
00:52:08,589 --> 00:52:10,960
he saved me an AJ what a stain is camp

736
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:12,930
for the night why did you bring him here

737
00:52:12,930 --> 00:52:15,369
you led him right to us

738
00:52:15,369 --> 00:52:18,820
I mean he's a stranger clumb running

739
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:20,050
into those two in the woods

740
00:52:20,050 --> 00:52:22,450
it proved we can't trust anybody look

741
00:52:22,450 --> 00:52:24,520
he's not with the Raiders he lives by

742
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:26,650
himself in the woods well he said he was

743
00:52:26,650 --> 00:52:29,260
wearing I don't know animal skins or

744
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:29,800
something

745
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:32,320
yeah animal skin yeah wearing walker

746
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:33,370
skin

747
00:52:33,370 --> 00:52:35,560
it's how he gets past herds he can guide

748
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:38,160
them to Wow

749
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:41,440
okay I wouldn't have brought him here if

750
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:43,660
I thought he was a threat it's not that

751
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:45,880
I don't trust you I'm just worried about

752
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:48,910
the others and what they might do they

753
00:52:48,910 --> 00:52:50,560
didn't even get a chance to mourn Brodie

754
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:52,420
and Marlin before these child snatching

755
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:55,750
assholes showed up and then you two come

756
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:57,940
back after we thought you were dead now

757
00:52:57,940 --> 00:52:59,890
they're confused and no one knows how to

758
00:52:59,890 --> 00:53:01,420
feel about AJ violet

759
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:03,850
AJ is the least of their worries I know

760
00:53:03,850 --> 00:53:06,160
but everything is such a mess they're

761
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:08,020
scared and angry and they're looking for

762
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:11,260
someone to blame I mean they kicked you

763
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:13,210
out how am I supposed to make them

764
00:53:13,210 --> 00:53:15,100
change their minds about you it was

765
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:18,460
decided five to three against you don't

766
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:20,860
have to let me convince them yeah we

767
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:22,300
haven't had a speech yet and we need

768
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:23,860
that speech you know I thought at least

769
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:27,070
we would get a stay but we'll do next he

770
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:28,750
said they'll get more people and guns

771
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:31,420
and come attack us take everyone here

772
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:35,410
how the hell would he know he's watched

773
00:53:35,410 --> 00:53:37,870
them for a while they're at war with

774
00:53:37,870 --> 00:53:39,970
another community they take people to

775
00:53:39,970 --> 00:53:42,730
fight for them is that what happened to

776
00:53:42,730 --> 00:53:44,890
mini and Sophie they turned them into

777
00:53:44,890 --> 00:53:47,650
soldiers yeah it'll happen to us too if

778
00:53:47,650 --> 00:53:50,530
we don't stop them and he didn't even

779
00:53:50,530 --> 00:53:55,660
like killing walkers they're likely to

780
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:58,180
keep the fax machine you know just in

781
00:53:58,180 --> 00:54:00,340
case you got a fax look at this place

782
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:06,610
it's a fortress with a little work we

783
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:08,110
could make this place really hard to

784
00:54:08,110 --> 00:54:10,570
attack do you actually know how to do

785
00:54:10,570 --> 00:54:13,660
that yeah I was part of a siege once in

786
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:17,470
a town called Richmond here don't ask me

787
00:54:17,470 --> 00:54:21,690
to it though

788
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:23,700
all right so let's play in our defense

789
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:26,430
as you see here the gate your your guy

790
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:28,950
defending it strong walls we need to

791
00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:30,210
make them hard to climb over

792
00:54:30,210 --> 00:54:31,829
so the Raiders have to come in through

793
00:54:31,829 --> 00:54:33,869
the gates we used to keep barbed wire in

794
00:54:33,869 --> 00:54:37,710
the greenhouse yeah and then you need to

795
00:54:37,710 --> 00:54:39,450
get it the courtyards pretty wide open

796
00:54:39,450 --> 00:54:42,059
not a lot of cover we should flip the

797
00:54:42,059 --> 00:54:43,950
picnic tables narrow down the pathways

798
00:54:43,950 --> 00:54:45,510
through it so we'll know which way

799
00:54:45,510 --> 00:54:47,609
they're coming at the very least it'll

800
00:54:47,609 --> 00:54:49,020
give us protection if they get past

801
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:53,640
these walls this is where we should make

802
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:54,299
our stand

803
00:54:54,299 --> 00:54:58,319
I need to pee am I in the front and then

804
00:54:58,319 --> 00:55:00,240
there's the big center that's what she

805
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:06,359
said oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah

806
00:55:06,359 --> 00:55:08,309
keep watching Starck F great jokes

807
00:55:08,309 --> 00:55:10,829
coming that path with traps we can pull

808
00:55:10,829 --> 00:55:14,460
back here luring in our attackers I like

809
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:18,780
it that's a good idea actually well you

810
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:20,190
guys don't use the green house anymore

811
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:20,670
do you

812
00:55:20,670 --> 00:55:24,119
no we used to then we lost someone up

813
00:55:24,119 --> 00:55:26,369
there walkers over ran the place and

814
00:55:26,369 --> 00:55:29,579
Marlon wouldn't let us go back safe zone

815
00:55:29,579 --> 00:55:31,650
we need to get that barbed wire so they

816
00:55:31,650 --> 00:55:36,930
can't climb the walls I'll go oh my god

817
00:55:36,930 --> 00:55:39,329
are you sure it's gonna be swarming with

818
00:55:39,329 --> 00:55:40,859
walkers by now okay what the hell's

819

821
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:48,299

822
00:55:48,299 --> 00:55:50,880
decided alright I broke it back up would

823
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:54,510

827
00:56:03,210 --> 00:56:05,550
those people who shot Louis they're

828
00:56:05,550 --> 00:56:08,910
arming up to attack the school we need

829
00:56:08,910 --> 00:56:12,390
Clem's help like hell we do for all we

830
00:56:12,390 --> 00:56:13,740
know she's one of them

831
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:16,590
she's not if you saw their leaders boot

832
00:56:16,590 --> 00:56:19,080
on Clem's neck do you know that these

833
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:20,970
Raiders all carry guns and they know how

834
00:56:20,970 --> 00:56:22,800
to use them so whatever you think of me

835
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:24,870
and AJ deal with it or you're gonna end

836
00:56:24,870 --> 00:56:27,090
up dead I'd rather take my chances

837
00:56:27,090 --> 00:56:29,400
climbs going to the greenhouse to find

838
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:31,320
barbed wire and anything else she thinks

839
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:33,030
we need for the fight and you're going

840
00:56:33,030 --> 00:56:36,420
to help her uh no I'm not yes you are

841
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:38,190
it's too dangerous for her to go by

842
00:56:38,190 --> 00:56:41,610
herself and you're good in a fight I can

843
00:56:41,610 --> 00:56:46,100
go to you know to keep the peace

844
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:49,110

848
00:56:57,960 --> 00:56:59,790
and you can head to the greenhouse once

849
00:56:59,790 --> 00:57:07,540

851
00:57:11,650 --> 00:57:13,030

856
00:57:31,270 --> 00:57:34,080
game has changed my opinion about him

857
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:36,130
needs to think it was just a spoiled

858
00:57:36,130 --> 00:57:46,680
brat but he's got a heart

859
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:50,789

909
01:00:46,790 --> 01:00:48,590

910
01:00:48,590 --> 01:00:55,360
door opens Oh

911
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,790
well you know I would probably Scout it

912
01:00:57,790 --> 01:01:02,910
a little bit before jumping but you know

913
01:01:02,910 --> 01:01:13,240
all right this is that big we actually

914
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:37,840
went in without a weapon it's two of

915
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:40,930
them we can handle them so this one is

916
01:01:40,930 --> 01:01:46,950
faster well God he went the same way

917
01:01:46,950 --> 01:01:53,699
[Applause]

918
01:01:53,699 --> 01:02:03,089

I'm coming I'll get the door open we

920
01:02:09,369 --> 01:02:10,569

01:02:10,569 --> 01:02:23,380
happened to be knife they're not bad oh

922

Eastern prickly pear Jerusalem artichoke

927
01:02:34,499 --> 01:02:39,609
false to home and seal let's find that

928
01:02:39,609 --> 01:02:41,380
barbed wire and anything else that might

929
01:02:41,380 --> 01:02:49,599
be useful I'm sick of talking to me but

930
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:52,029
let's just get there barbed wire

931
01:02:52,029 --> 01:02:58,239
lawnmower that's awesome Clementine is

932
01:02:58,239 --> 01:03:00,599
not impressed all right sorry Clementine

933
01:03:00,599 --> 01:03:02,499
shovel that's epic

934
01:03:02,499 --> 01:03:05,589
could be a weapon or you use it to dig a

935
01:03:05,589 --> 01:03:08,859
grave you weren't there when we dug the

936
01:03:08,859 --> 01:03:11,169
holes for Marlon and Brody we had to use

937
01:03:11,169 --> 01:03:16,719
cups and bowls took forever yeah that's

938
01:03:16,719 --> 01:03:23,800
kind of fuck

939
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:27,760
it's pretty good just put that in my

940
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:30,420
back pocket just slide it in there for

941
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:33,670
locks okay so we this is another thing

942
01:03:33,670 --> 01:03:35,740
with games like you find you'll find the

943
01:03:35,740 --> 01:03:37,720
component that you need before you find

944
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:42,070
the obstacle

945
01:03:42,070 --> 01:03:44,260
so awkward

946
01:03:44,260 --> 01:03:51,360
[Applause]

947
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:54,070
maybe if we have something strong we can

948
01:03:54,070 --> 01:03:55,690
use it to open barbed wire

949
01:03:55,690 --> 01:03:57,910
a lot of it too as you keep the Rangers

950
01:03:57,910 --> 01:04:00,610
from climbing our walls hey we can use

951
01:04:00,610 --> 01:04:02,380
these we can just put them in there

952
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:04,450
buckler back pocket we can make bombs

953
01:04:04,450 --> 01:04:07,990
out of these bombs are you serious

954
01:04:07,990 --> 01:04:10,960
totally it's the kind of stuff I made

955
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:13,869
back home he used to blow shit up that's

956
01:04:13,869 --> 01:04:17,500
why he's a troubled youth healthy let's

957
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:19,030
go let's need some propane and something

958
01:04:19,030 --> 01:04:20,740
to create a spark and we'll have

959
01:04:20,740 --> 01:04:22,330
ourselves a nice little homemade

960
01:04:22,330 --> 01:04:28,960
explosive so far there lie surplus

961
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:36,280
propane equals bomb some mushrooms are

962
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:39,230
edible

963
01:04:39,230 --> 01:04:50,280
probably not edible find something yep

964
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:53,970
maybe useful she has a really big back

965
01:04:53,970 --> 01:04:58,470
pocket let me just say they eat the

966
01:04:58,470 --> 01:05:02,700
mushroom why would I you seem happy

967
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:05,820
definitely the same bland rabbits do so

968
01:05:05,820 --> 01:05:08,400
many times before you go crazy these

969
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:09,810
herbs are gonna do wonders for morale

970
01:05:09,810 --> 01:05:18,840
you wait and see if I remember right

971
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:20,490
there's a science lab through that door

972
01:05:20,490 --> 01:05:23,910
maybe there's propane in their car would

973
01:05:23,910 --> 01:05:25,700
make sense help me move this thing

974
01:05:25,700 --> 01:05:28,110
see now we're working as a team and

975
01:05:28,110 --> 01:05:31,170
we're bonding look at that I love it

976
01:05:31,170 --> 01:05:32,970
that's excellent

977
01:05:32,970 --> 01:05:35,490
this is great for team morale this is

978
01:05:35,490 --> 01:05:50,070
very slow isn't it look at that sure

979
01:05:50,070 --> 01:05:54,570

you're still little ya know do you think

1208
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:11,320
it's in our natural morale or like DNA -

1209
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:13,120
that makes no sense

1210
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:16,730
but to have the idea some weather is

1211
01:23:16,730 --> 01:23:18,710
right to kill or not cuz surely that

1212
01:23:18,710 --> 01:23:22,040
just comes natural it seems like he's

1213
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:24,190
been brought up with the idea to just

1214
01:23:24,190 --> 01:23:26,990
kill danger but he doesn't even think

1215
01:23:26,990 --> 01:23:28,340
about what he means to kill in our the

1216
01:23:28,340 --> 01:23:30,020
human but that just doesn't make any

1217
01:23:30,020 --> 01:23:31,790
sense ready to work today kiddo

1218
01:23:31,790 --> 01:23:34,940

1349

I'm being stupid you're the one who

1353

1356
01:30:22,070 --> 01:30:24,100
sim won't listen to anything I say

1357
01:30:24,100 --> 01:30:26,060
doesn't mean you have to scream at each

1358
01:30:26,060 --> 01:30:28,430
other stay out of this I have an idea

1359
01:30:28,430 --> 01:30:30,710
for duffle bags filled with bricks we

1360
01:30:30,710 --> 01:30:32,720
drop them on the Raiders if they get to

1361
01:30:32,720 --> 01:30:34,580
the admin building Willy here wants to

1362
01:30:34,580 --> 01:30:37,280
use a giant idiotic swinging log to take

1363
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:40,760
out one Raider at most it's completely

1364
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:43,310
stupid you're stupid you're being

1365
01:30:43,310 --> 01:30:44,690
childish

1366
01:30:44,690 --> 01:30:47,270
I'm trying to help so help I don't know

1367

1368
01:30:48,980 --> 01:30:50,900
care going with the Simms plan what but

1369
01:30:50,900 --> 01:30:53,180
nothing it's more practical why it's

1370
01:30:53,180 --> 01:30:55,790
practical too no it isn't it's exactly

1371
01:30:55,790 --> 01:30:57,440
the kind of thing a child would think of

1372
01:30:57,440 --> 01:30:59,180
especially a child who has no idea what

1373
01:30:59,180 --> 01:31:08,180

1376
01:31:11,960 --> 01:31:13,580
the Raiders even get a fucking chance

1377
01:31:13,580 --> 01:31:15,440
what we need is something to break the

1378
01:31:15,440 --> 01:31:17,250
tension

1379
01:31:17,250 --> 01:31:22,080

01:36:34,140 --> 01:36:37,230
another location and another one will

1465
01:36:37,230 --> 01:36:40,950
start an age without walkers like it

1466
01:36:40,950 --> 01:36:41,730
used to be

1467
01:36:41,730 --> 01:36:45,330
it'll be better

1468
01:36:45,330 --> 01:36:47,390
why is everyone looking at me like that

1469
01:36:47,390 --> 01:36:50,840
did I ruin the game that's really

1470

1478
01:37:20,700 --> 01:37:22,440

1507
01:38:49,060 --> 01:38:49,750

1613
01:45:20,610 --> 01:45:24,090

sorry I didn't mean to dis talk so much

1616
01:45:31,130 --> 01:45:34,380
if it was me I would focus more on this

1617
01:45:34,380 --> 01:45:36,449
part and just cut the card game part

1618
01:45:36,449 --> 01:45:37,650
because I feel like we already had a

1619
01:45:37,650 --> 01:45:39,809
downtown bit and this just seems kind of

1620
01:45:39,809 --> 01:45:41,460
redundant thank you even though it's a

1621
01:45:41,460 --> 01:45:45,630
nice moment but you did and now I can't

1622
01:45:45,630 --> 01:45:47,579
imagine what it would be like if you

1623
01:45:47,579 --> 01:45:56,460
weren't here it's this bad pacing that

1624
01:45:56,460 --> 01:45:58,650

1843
02:05:40,170 --> 02:05:48,260
Danya poor Mitch

1844
02:05:48,260 --> 02:05:52,400
oh I missed the plant damn I messed up

1845
02:05:52,400 --> 02:05:57,139
guys I'll do better next time today that

1846
02:05:57,139 --> 02:05:59,329
was really fun I enjoyed this episode

1847
02:05:59,329 --> 02:06:01,190
more than Episode one but I think that's

1848
02:06:01,190 --> 02:06:03,170
natural because episode one is always

1849
02:06:03,170 --> 02:06:05,510
gonna be the setup right but that's also

1850
02:06:05,510 --> 02:06:06,619
what's so annoying if there's always a

1851
02:06:06,619 --> 02:06:08,119
setup to this games it's like why can't

1852
02:06:08,119 --> 02:06:11,599
we just play in what they have there's

1853
02:06:11,599 --> 02:06:13,280
such an emotional attachment between Lee

1854
02:06:13,280 --> 02:06:14,750
and Clementine even though Lee this is

1855
02:06:14,750 --> 02:06:16,400
not even alive but for any of the other

1856
02:06:16,400 --> 02:06:19,099
characters it's just like I guess it

1857
02:06:19,099 --> 02:06:24,230
will pick Jaden and we're violent this

1858
02:06:24,230 --> 02:06:26,239
could possibly be the last episode we

1859
02:06:26,239 --> 02:06:29,000
play I we don't know whether they're

1860
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:34,510
gonna release episode three or four him

1861
02:06:34,510 --> 02:06:37,849
allegedly on November 6 I'll let you

1862
02:06:37,849 --> 02:06:40,039
guys know if it comes out I'll be

1863
02:06:40,039 --> 02:06:43,519
playing it if it does if it doesn't kind

1864
02:06:43,519 --> 02:06:46,610
of a sad ending to end it like this I'd

1865
02:06:46,610 --> 02:06:49,400
be crazy that'd be crazy but you know a

1866
02:06:49,400 --> 02:06:50,599
lot of people are talking about it house

1867
02:06:50,599 --> 02:06:52,489
another company could buy the rights for

1868
02:06:52,489 --> 02:06:54,889
it but it's a lot more complicated than

1869
02:06:54,889 --> 02:06:56,030
that you have different people owning

1870
02:06:56,030 --> 02:06:59,150
different parts of it and it might seem

1871
02:06:59,150 --> 02:07:00,800
easy from over an outsider a lot of

1872
02:07:00,800 --> 02:07:02,389
these things like oh yeah can't we just

1873
02:07:02,389 --> 02:07:04,039
do a Kickstarter oh yeah can't we just

1874
02:07:04,039 --> 02:07:05,480
do this and I think it's cool that

1875
02:07:05,480 --> 02:07:07,789
people want to help but it's always way

1876
02:07:07,789 --> 02:07:09,800
more complicated than you think and all

1877
02:07:09,800 --> 02:07:12,039
the legal stuff is always just crazy

1878
02:07:12,039 --> 02:07:14,360
especially when it comes to video games

1879
02:07:14,360 --> 02:07:17,269
so we can only hope we get to see the

1880
02:07:17,269 --> 02:07:24,230
conclusion of Clementine but yeah thanks

1881
02:07:24,230 --> 02:07:26,000
for watching this episode regardless it

1882
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:27,860
was fun I it's a shame that they're

1883
02:07:27,860 --> 02:07:33,769
picking up on these things now it sucks

1884
02:07:33,769 --> 02:07:36,469
to be honest but I hope you had fun

1885
02:07:36,469 --> 02:07:38,480

1886
02:07:38,480 --> 02:07:40,010

1887
