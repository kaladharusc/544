1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:10,320
man they sure did go all in on the make

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,820
the kids look dirty make up did they dig

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,260
that hole with their faces don't worry

4
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:14,820
it's just a pack of wolves I mean

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,890
they'll only tear us limb from limb if

6
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:18,240
they get any closer but this board game

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,099
is super scary so let's continue we see

8
00:00:23,099 --> 00:00:24,390
throughout the film that the game lures

9
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,039
players in with it's hypnotizing drum

10
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:28,050
beats but why do it now when no one is

11
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:33,210
around to hear all yours

12
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:34,800
the kid clearly wrote across when it

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,600
said don't walk plus aren't you supposed

14
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,980
to walk your bike across the street

15
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,030
I'm just saying bill should have at

16
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,399
least given Allen a stern talking-to

17
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:43,320
for all these bullies seriously hiding

18
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,910
out behind the statue in anticipation of

19
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,440
Allen riding by how do they know his

20
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,789
schedule so well this is an absurd

21
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:49,199
amount of reconnaissance to plan an

22
00:00:49,199 --> 00:00:52,589
otherwise standard nerd beating come on

23
00:00:52,589 --> 00:00:54,570
kid his actual name is Parrish prepare

24
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,309
to perish perish was just sitting there

25
00:00:56,309 --> 00:00:57,570
for you and you completely missed it

26
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,219
cause you should know better than to let

27
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:01,289
the boy playing human Sam admonishes

28
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:02,760
Carl for letting Allen play in the

29
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,320
factory after telling Allen the factory

30
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,940
isn't a playground when all Allen is

31
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,170
doing is literally just standing around

32
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,350
and talking just French not anymore so

33
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:11,820
you're saying she's my girlfriend now

34
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,890
sweet wait why do you still look angry

35
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:16,260
yeah the Jessup gang proceeds to beat up

36
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,880
Allen outside his father's shoe company

37
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,230
even though they were clearly adults

38
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:20,340
milling around in the background just

39
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,960
seconds before who could intervene at

40
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,400
any moment I haven't seen this many

41
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,620
negligent adults since I watched all 103

42
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,800
episodes of Teen Mom silly takes off on

43
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,720
Allen's bike but who gets Billy spike

44
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,460
does he just leave it there does one of

45
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,720
the other bullies take it with them that

46
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,070
means there should be a kid in that mix

47
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,780
who's walking two bikes home and I'm not

48
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,280
seeing it Hey look it's a disheveled

49
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,050
bloodied kid casually walking into a

50
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:41,700
hardhat construction zone guess we

51
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,570
should all just go about our business

52
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:43,130
then

53
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:44,390
[Music]

54
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:46,790
this dude wanted a child dig some sort

55
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:48,020
of ancient box out of the side of a

56
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,729
construction site but doesn't do or say

57
00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:51,860
about it I guess he's still on his Union

58
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:55,880
mandated coffee break what was that you

59
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,010
order to of course I heard it besides

60
00:01:58,010 --> 00:01:59,420
the hair color this movie may have set

61
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,590
the record for kids that looked the

62
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,390
least like their eventual adult selves I

63
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,040
found this really weird game in the

64
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,960
factory a game

65
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,509
there was no way that Alan fit that game

66
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:09,979
into his suitcase especially since he

67
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:11,239
had all that food stashed in there

68
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:12,590
before he even packed it all so I

69
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,270
thought Alan was super psyched to run

70
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:15,860
away and the appearance of Sarah didn't

71
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,120
even deter it but now he's ready to

72
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,410
abandon the entire plan just to play

73
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:19,850
this game how much hole does this thing

74
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:21,620
have over him the CEO with money to

75
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,030
munch roll credits

76
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,500
you roll the dice to move your token

77
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,750
doubles gets another turn and the first

78
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,459
player to reach Han wins you want to

79
00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:30,200
play I understand there's some magical

80
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,760
influence here but this sounds like a

81
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,769
boring game the instructions just say to

82
00:02:33,769 --> 00:02:35,450
roll the dice and move you so why would

83
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:37,060
Alan be so fucking excited about playing

84
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:39,769
board games five years ago what was

85
00:02:39,769 --> 00:02:41,450
behind Sarah's hilariously specific

86
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:42,950
board game embargo did she have a

87
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,750
dramatic Candyland incident was there an

88
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:45,980
ankle injury related to chutes and

89
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:53,420
ladders these bat holes wait to attack

90
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,340
simmer until after Alan's turn and after

91
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,540
he's sucked into the game probably

92
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:57,680
because they've been trained in

93
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,890
cinematic timing yeah they're terrifying

94
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,480
and definitely a nuisance but these bats

95
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,769
aren't doing jack to Sarah

96
00:03:03,769 --> 00:03:05,060
except flying around maybe they're

97
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,110
trying to teach her about becoming a

98
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:07,790
symbol of hope to a crime riddled city

99
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:09,230
or something like that damn it Lily you

100
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,549
just showed the year on the first two

101
00:03:10,549 --> 00:03:11,959
time periods but now you're expecting me

102
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:13,340
to do math and figure out what the data

103
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,690
is I was told there would be no fucking

104
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:17,420
math I'll have to get a locksmith out

105
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,070
for this one spooky mansion comes

106
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,239
complete with it's very own locked

107
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:21,980
mystery door that the realtor lady just

108
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,540
didn't feel the need to unlock or break

109
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,950
down herself before selling it to

110
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:27,110
somebody I'm going to Motel sex this is

111
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:28,519
Tom Beaudette and we'll leave the

112
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:30,200
product placement on for you that's an

113
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,269
African bat some kids said she saw a

114
00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:33,769
bunch of those back in the sixties

115
00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:36,019
really moving 26 years later in a random

116
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:37,760
expositional exterminator happens to

117
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,320
remember some kids saying she saw the

118
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,730
same kind of bat what's worse is that

119
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:42,350
it's not even exposition we need also

120
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:43,700
how does a kid scared out of his mind

121
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,290
give detailed enough information to

122
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:46,730
identify the species of a winged

123
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:48,140
creature of death that came after the

124
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,510
let alone two kids 26 years apart also

125
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:52,130
if the bat that Peter saw was one of the

126
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:54,620
ones Sarah saw back in 1969 how is that

127
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,569
bat still alive 26 years later do all

128
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:57,569
the animals that come out

129
00:03:57,569 --> 00:03:58,859
we lived forever do they have the

130
00:03:58,859 --> 00:04:01,709
ability to reproduce that's on I worry

131
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:03,540
about a literally bat enthusiast in

132
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,159
scary attic with two underage children

133
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:06,930
feels the need to up the creep factor

134
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:08,609
211 by telling the story of another

135
00:04:08,609 --> 00:04:10,409
minor who was murdered and dismembered

136
00:04:10,409 --> 00:04:11,609
and probably buried somewhere in the

137
00:04:11,609 --> 00:04:12,900
house because who doesn't love

138
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:20,430
frightening children Lilith was able to

139
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,049
get this place in tip-top shape by

140
00:04:22,049 --> 00:04:23,550
herself within a day notice how a

141
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:24,840
monopoly is at the bottom of the other

142
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,349
stack

143
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:26,669
that's because Monopoly much like

144
00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:28,590
Jumanji tears people's lives apart back

145
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:30,900
in 1869 they had to bury the out of this

146
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,190
game to prevent it from endangering

147
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,750
anyone else but it's been hanging out up

148
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,430
here for 26 years without any problem

149
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:39,509
until now sure it's a cool box but

150
00:04:39,509 --> 00:04:40,800
there's no way the kids would know that

151
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,690
this game is the source of the drumming

152
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:44,190
noise that terrified the mere moments

153
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:48,449
ago it's gotta be microchips or

154
00:04:48,449 --> 00:04:50,490
something yes the progress of Technology

155
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,080
joke is cute but how exactly would

156
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,550
microchips do this it's clearly

157
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:54,990
magnetics whether you're a kid from the

158
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,910
60s or 90s and learned it from mr.

159
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:59,099
wizard or mr. Nye the Science Guy we all

160
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:02,370
know this be magnets how did they know

161
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:03,720
to look for information from the magic

162
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,949
green circle there was no reason for

163
00:05:04,949 --> 00:05:06,659
them to be leaning in here or really to

164
00:05:06,659 --> 00:05:08,130
assume anything is about to happen those

165
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:09,990
mosquitoes are the size of birds if the

166
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:11,789
bats are genuine African bats and later

167
00:05:11,789 --> 00:05:13,380
we see other real animals why do the

168
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,909
mosquitoes get the growth hormones when

169
00:05:14,909 --> 00:05:16,940
the others don't

170
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,259
Judy Knox one mosquito out the window

171
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:20,520
and the other two mosquitoes follow

172
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,500
mosquitoes aren't hive mind insects they

173
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,759
just kind of do their own thing why do

174
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,169
the two mosquitoes follow the first one

175
00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:26,520
out the window when there are two easy

176
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,690
targets standing right in front of them

177
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:30,870
this will not be an easy mission monk

178
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:33,449
you slow the expedition why does he grab

179
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:34,889
the dice here I'm guessing there's some

180
00:05:34,889 --> 00:05:36,570
BS story reason he needs to have them

181
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,639
but why in this instance of monkey panic

182
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:39,810
would he think he would need them with

183
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:41,729
him also all the other times the players

184
00:05:41,729 --> 00:05:42,930
roll the dice something's happened to

185
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:44,729
them but on Peters turn the monkey show

186
00:05:44,729 --> 00:05:46,110
up in the kitchen sure they eventually

187
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:47,639
go down there to check out that noise

188
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:48,990
but basically they could have kept

189
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:52,590
playing upstairs with little consequence

190
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:55,210
Jesus Christ these murderous marauding

191
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:56,680
monkeys man wait let me get this

192
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,389
straight he grabbed the dice so that 60

193
00:05:58,389 --> 00:05:59,650
seconds later they could look at them

194
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,060
and remember they were playing a game I

195
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,620
know I send the dice grabbing once but

196
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,029
here's another sin for having such an

197
00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:06,969
unnecessary and flimsy reason I didn't

198
00:06:06,969 --> 00:06:08,919
see this part and apparently no one else

199
00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:11,409
did either by the Judy Peter Alan and

200
00:06:11,409 --> 00:06:13,180
Sarah not look at the only other written

201
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,710
text on this game that's not like there

202
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:16,090
was a 40 page instruction manual

203
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:17,560
instructions say if we finish the game

204
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,580
it'll all go away

205
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,080
we've only had mosquitos and monkeys so

206
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,090
far why not stop the game here before it

207
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,529
gets worse unless the animals are

208
00:06:23,529 --> 00:06:25,029
completely indestructible and pervious

209
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:26,710
to animal control monkeys and a few

210
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:28,150
giant mosquitoes seem pretty easy to

211
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:30,009
manage right sure later on we discovered

212
00:06:30,009 --> 00:06:31,449
the mosquitos are making people sick but

213
00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:33,729
duty doesn't know that it takes movie

214
00:06:33,729 --> 00:06:37,300
nearly 30 minutes to finally Mork mom

215
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,400
and dad this house has been empty for

216
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,259
years wait this isn't a big leg

217
00:06:41,259 --> 00:06:42,879
situation where Alan wakes up as a grown

218
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:44,889
man he's been living inside the game for

219
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:46,360
26 years I could clearly note the

220
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,460
passage of time sure he'd be looking for

221
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:49,839
his parents when he came back but he

222
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:51,129
would totally know that it's been a long

223
00:06:51,129 --> 00:06:51,879
while since he left

224
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:53,169
looks like Alan never outgrew his

225
00:06:53,169 --> 00:06:54,639
running out into a busy street without

226
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,419
looking habit when it comes to the

227
00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:00,370
monkey CGI in this movie I'm guessing

228
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:01,750
the CG stands for a complete garbage

229
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,460
also is this a standard police procedure

230
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,860
for shotgun storage loaded safety off

231
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,389
and vertically stored this is to fight

232
00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:09,069
off all those sudden car top killers

233
00:07:09,069 --> 00:07:10,659
I've been hearing about Aunt Nora seemed

234
00:07:10,659 --> 00:07:12,310
to think the theists town to ever exist

235
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:13,779
is the perfect place for her bed and

236
00:07:13,779 --> 00:07:16,300
breakfast when his kid ran away Sam put

237
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,710
everything you had into trying to find

238
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:19,960
him I don't think anybody loved his boy

239
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,060
more than Sam did random homeless dude

240
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,560
is extremely knowledgeable about the

241
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,509
family dynamic between Sam and Alan the

242
00:07:25,509 --> 00:07:27,399
parish is still around I see him now and

243
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:29,199
then they're over on Adams Street I

244
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,610
really hope this quarter clarified off

245
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:31,990
screen that Alan's parents are actually

246
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:33,729
in the cemetery on Adams Street because

247
00:07:33,729 --> 00:07:34,810
if you didn't then that's a dick move

248
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:35,349
sir

249
00:07:35,349 --> 00:07:37,960
ooh nice boots mrs. Thomas but don't you

250
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,310
want something a little comfier for the

251
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:44,199
ambulance ride that's more like it is

252
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:45,610
Alan the seasoned vet at fighting all

253
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:47,259
the creatures in the game Laura see this

254
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:49,029
comic relief he was a badass when facing

255
00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:50,379
down the lion earlier but now he's

256
00:07:50,379 --> 00:07:53,770
freaked out about a fucking bug realtor

257
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:55,270
ladies car keys were left in the

258
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,710
ignition and her car in the middle of

259
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,629
the road the guys in the ambulance call

260
00:07:58,629 --> 00:08:00,039
for any kind of backup to get the wreck

261
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:01,449
cleared away or do a few giant

262
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:02,800
mosquitoes get the same martial law

263
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,009
treatment as a zombie apocalypse

264
00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:06,599
yeah but what happened to the giant

265
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:07,949
mosquito that was locked in the

266
00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:09,419
windshield it just flew away after being

267
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:10,619
previously obsessed with biting these

268
00:08:10,619 --> 00:08:14,309
assholes even though there's a literal

269
00:08:14,309 --> 00:08:15,869
lion somewhere in the house Alan and

270
00:08:15,869 --> 00:08:17,639
therefore movie has time for this whoa

271
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:19,259
did they have a barber training course

272
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:20,759
and Alan's jungle coz that's a pretty

273
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:22,559
stellar self cut I've seen things you've

274
00:08:22,559 --> 00:08:23,999
only seen in your nightmares

275
00:08:23,999 --> 00:08:25,499
ah so Alan saw an early cut a

276
00:08:25,499 --> 00:08:27,689
Bicentennial man it's not my time this

277
00:08:27,689 --> 00:08:30,899
turn is it Sarah Whittle so let me get

278
00:08:30,899 --> 00:08:31,229
this straight

279
00:08:31,229 --> 00:08:33,539
with one roll of the dice Alan lost 26

280
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:35,339
years of his life but Sarah just got

281
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:36,839
briefly chased by a few bats that lived

282
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:38,309
a fairly normal life traumatized life

283
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,809
but what happened to the bats I didn't

284
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:41,789
put anyone else in town this place gives

285
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:44,009
me the creeps said Peter staring up at

286
00:08:44,009 --> 00:08:45,209
what was probably the nicest looking

287
00:08:45,209 --> 00:08:51,660
house in the neighborhood you killed her

288
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,920
character gets shocking news and

289
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,660
immediately passes out cliche well he

290
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,189
really feels like this was a 90s thing

291
00:08:56,189 --> 00:08:57,629
doesn't it look I know that they've got

292
00:08:57,629 --> 00:08:59,249
to have Sally to play the game but did

293
00:08:59,249 --> 00:09:00,629
they really need to kidnap her from her

294
00:09:00,629 --> 00:09:02,639
own home also sure it was shocking for

295
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:04,259
her to see how alive but they didn't

296
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:06,209
drug her right she stayed passed out on

297
00:09:06,209 --> 00:09:07,410
this entire trip back to the parish

298
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:11,040
house my father could barely hug me let

299
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,829
alone company into pieces not quite sure

300
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:15,750
your syllogism is valid since you're a

301
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,910
presupposition of fathers who don't hug

302
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,680
don't dismember is likely untrue we

303
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:26,189
started playing a little game now just a

304
00:09:26,189 --> 00:09:27,569
few minutes ago Alan was lecturing the

305
00:09:27,569 --> 00:09:29,040
kids about how dangerous this game is

306
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,809
how impossible it is to win but now he

307
00:09:30,809 --> 00:09:32,430
tracked down Sarah kidnaps her and

308
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:33,990
forces her to play the game Jesus this

309
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,790
movie's unexpectedly dark did I miss a

310
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,079
plum house logo at the beginning of this

311
00:09:37,079 --> 00:09:39,790
movie harvest time

312
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:42,020
wait that's it they just had to free

313
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,430
Peter from the one pod and the vine

314
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:44,660
system to get out of the immediate

315
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:45,050
danger

316
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:46,190
what the hell are the actual rules for

317
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:48,020
this game and one role you can get just

318
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,400
a brief but ultimately harmless

319
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,900
vegetation attack and in the next one

320
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,460
you're banished to the jungle for 26

321
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:56,330
years oh my god I won this Karl been

322
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,170
looking for his crusier

323
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:58,520
Alan and the kids have gone to the

324
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,110
factory discovered his parents are dead

325
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:01,880
still in a car taking a nap went through

326
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,200
the lecture about how dangerous this is

327
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,000
went to find Sarah kidnapped her and

328
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,530
then fought the magical vine but Carl's

329
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:09,380
just now finding his car okay I'll buy

330
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,700
that nobody's heard the monkeys in the

331
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,680
lion messing around inside but no one

332
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,110
hears it reports these gunshots I take

333
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:16,760
Carl driving up to the scene for anyone

334
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,380
to recognize what's going on Carl gets

335
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,610
in his car and drives away without

336
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,470
securing the area calling for backup or

337
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:22,820
calling in the report of a strangely

338
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,290
dressed dude destroying his cruiser with

339
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,760
a very large gun in a residential

340
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,210
neighborhood

341
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:27,740
we wouldn't has called me crazy ever

342
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:28,850
since I told the cops that you were

343
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:30,950
sucked into a board game so you changed

344
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:32,780
your last name and didn't leave town and

345
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:35,000
didn't change houses either and while

346
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,680
we're headed are you even a real psychic

347
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,820
if you are surely you would have

348
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:41,270
predicted this Andy didn't in addition

349
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,650
to training at Juilliard robin williams

350
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:43,970
attended the prometheus school of

351
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:45,890
running away from things now anyone asks

352
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:48,650
you didn't get this here you're not a

353
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:50,750
postal worker are you and some of these

354
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:54,650
jokes have really not aged well so Alan

355
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:56,630
tracked this bird based on just knowing

356
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,310
it would go towards water and he somehow

357
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:59,510
found it this quickly and there was

358
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:01,070
absolutely nothing wild about that goose

359
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:03,050
chase a pelican chase or African Pelican

360
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:06,200
thing chase okay fine maybe living in

361
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,580
the jungle 26 years taught you this

362
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,140
skill but convenient fish is still

363
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,940
convenient so how did this four survive

364
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,830
as a kid inside the Jumanji jungle this

365
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:14,780
kid gets beat up by sixth graders chance

366
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:15,950
did he have against all the creatures

367
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:20,120
that live inside the game let's go have

368
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,890
we had any indication of this sudden

369
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,750
dynamic between Alan and Peter I mean I

370
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,740
guess he's supposed to be a father

371
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,880
figure that didn't have a good enough

372
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,650
example or something but this is totally

373
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:29,210
manufactured considering they've been

374
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:30,620
essentially equals in this movie so far

375
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,690
every time there's trouble I remain to

376
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:34,130
you I don't know what you're talking

377
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:35,240
about all right I'm taking you away

378
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,830
forever eat I'm

379
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,270
you mean like the two times because

380
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,650
currently there is a much trouble going

381
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:41,120
on and neither are those times had

382
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,589
anything to do with anything Alan did

383
00:11:42,589 --> 00:11:44,120
how are these animals still stampeding

384
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,770
together I mean not sure of the ground

385
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:47,870
speed velocity of an African zebra but

386
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,130
I'm guessing it's not the same as the

387
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:50,450
elephants and rhinos with or without

388
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:53,530
coconuts

389
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:55,970
monkey Peter survives this VanPelt

390
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:57,470
strides purposely toward the sir

391
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:59,060
sav-a-lot light this is all part of the

392
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,980
plant even though he's new to town and

393
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,150
from a very different time period

394
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:03,770
entirely and the building offers no

395
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:04,970
clear advantage to what he's trying to

396
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:08,570
accomplish this works now what are we

397
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:10,210
gonna do

398
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:13,010
why officer Carl here just let you go

399
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:14,750
and was on your side what on earth is

400
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,070
there to gain from locking him to his

401
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:20,000
car goddammit not only are these fucking

402
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,380
monkeys able to operate the clutch of

403
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,910
this motorcycle despite none of them

404
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:23,960
being able to reach it they've also

405
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,400
figured out how to operate the siren

406
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,110
these monkeys and the bike they wrote in

407
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:31,850
on serie and the kids are able to pull

408
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:33,530
off this home alone style trap for Van

409
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:33,980
Pelt

410
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,330
despite zero communication with each

411
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:37,160
other also this is a moderately sized

412
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,510
department store and they're being

413
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:39,950
tracked by an experienced big-game

414
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:41,750
hunter but whatever bring on the prat

415
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,820
balls I could've shot you at any moment

416
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:46,550
then why didn't you you didn't roll the

417
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:49,700
dice monkeys are screwing with everyone

418
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,020
that Peters the one that rolled them the

419
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,340
giant mosquitoes didn't seem to care who

420
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,750
they were stinging Judy rolled the

421
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,370
Stampede and it's hang up home town

422
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:57,230
there is no reason for Van Pelt to have

423
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:58,910
such a huge killing boner for Alan ah

424
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,440
remember the 90s when we all thought

425
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,510
things chaotically crashing into lots of

426
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:03,980
other things was hilarious and exciting

427
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:06,880
yeah me neither

428
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,750
how do you escape certain death when

429
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,280
you've painted yourself into a corner a

430
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,490
latex machina of course where's Peter

431
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:13,780
[Music]

432
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:16,700
great really I mean giving the amount of

433
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,290
crazy that's happened this is arguably

434
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:19,880
the best case scenario Peter just has

435
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,230
some extra hair for the moment and all

436
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:22,370
they have to do is finish the game to

437
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:22,810
reverse it

438
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:24,570
[Music]

439
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,760
why would you get out of the car all

440
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,560
right another lazy setup for a not funny

441
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,780
gag involving a monkey also you know for

442
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,490
a stampede these animals are really good

443
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:33,990
about staying on the road we're gonna go

444
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:36,540
in here we're gonna finish that cake is

445
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,890
there some rule that they have to play

446
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:39,540
the game in the same location this game

447
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,890
has more unexplained rules than that

448
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:42,600
special room at my grandma's house I'm

449
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,250
not saying this magical vine couldn't

450
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,750
compact this police cruiser like this

451
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,610
I'm just saying why would it want to and

452
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:49,680
also that it couldn't every month at the

453
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,890
quarter moon there'll be a monsoon in

454
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:54,720
your Lagoon that's less of a riddle and

455
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,740
more like a straight-up there's a

456
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,480
monsoon coming this is what happens when

457
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,800
you let the writers assistants take the

458
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,690
wheel Jumanji can I ask why these idiots

459
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:02,010
keep waiting for the consequences to

460
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,600
show up before rolling again I feel like

461
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,620
if they just rolled one after another

462
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,970
they could have been finished before the

463
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:09,450
first drop hit the ground king hell man

464
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:11,760
the game promised a monsoon not a mutant

465
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,110
crocodile everything else has been

466
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:16,170
extremely specific about the threat hang

467
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:17,940
on the Stampede basically takes out an

468
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,650
entire wall of this home earlier how did

469
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,630
this water even collect Oh looky here

470
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,040
did the game manifest a helpful

471
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,050
stagehand Alan you wrestled an alligator

472
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:28,110
for me it's a crocodile alligators don't

473
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:30,180
have that little fringe and link rather

474
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,890
than kiss the love interest Alan chooses

475
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:32,970
demands playing the difference between

476
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:35,190
alligators and crocodiles also Alan will

477
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,450
be excellent at cinemasins

478
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:37,890
despite the water being everywhere in

479
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:40,530
the house this room is bone dry never

480
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:41,940
thought I'd find the effects in flubber

481
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,740
to be fantastically realistic but

482
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,330
compared to this it's a masterpiece but

483
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:46,830
why are they giant make up your mind

484
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,870
game actual animals or monster versions

485
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:50,640
this ax gag was actually pretty clever

486
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,710
so please Peter monkey tail ruin it by

487
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:56,910
breaking the fourth wall thanks geez he

488
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,440
just sunk into the floor below why

489
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,700
didn't he just fall all the way through

490
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,530
the quicksand then sure it'd be a pretty

491
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,030
high drop but it's better than getting

492
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,230
stuck in the fucking floorboards

493
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,640
considering the amount of hair on these

494
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,170
hands I guess Alan was also cursed with

495
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:08,360
the monkey virus

496
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,680
Van Pelt's coat of many colors makes

497
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,270
sense unless you remember that paint is

498
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,830
not pre-mixed all of that paint that

499
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:14,970
fell on him should have appeared white

500
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:17,040
as Alan makes his final roll now is as

501
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,300
good a time as any to recognize exactly

502
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,800
how little this movie has cared about

503
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,050
game continuity in fact I actually rode

504
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:25,470
a 917 word detailed diatribe listing 23

505
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:27,270
cases of game board mistakes pieces

506
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:29,100
moving backwards on the wrong spaces

507
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,020
jumping to other players tracks and not

508
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:31,620
adding up

509
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,030
including the fact that this three that

510
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,170
Alan just rolled will only get him

511
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:35,820
within six spaces of the finish at best

512
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,200
but instead of putting you through all

513
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,160
that piers to one

514
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,019
three sins plus 15 for the time I spent

515
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:42,420
on it and another 25 because any and all

516
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,740
of it would have been super easy to keep

517
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,300
track of you lazy mathematically

518
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,069
challenged slapstick loving continuity

519
00:15:47,069 --> 00:15:49,290
shunning holes of asses isn't this

520
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:50,879
bullet a real-world bullet I with the

521
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:52,709
game pull it back in yes I know the game

522
00:15:52,709 --> 00:15:54,209
is reversing all the consequences but

523
00:15:54,209 --> 00:15:55,500
it's only pulling back the things that

524
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,180
released in the accurate version Alan

525
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,560
takes the bullet to the head Sarah

526
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,149
screams a nightmarish scream but they

527
00:16:00,149 --> 00:16:02,339
both still wake up in 1959 just a tad

528
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:04,319
bit more traumatized oh great gravy on

529
00:16:04,319 --> 00:16:06,420
mashed potato Mountain time travel if

530
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,620
you can't even handle the rules of its

531
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,209
own game let alone the complexity that

532
00:16:09,209 --> 00:16:12,110
goes along with resetting a time line

533
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:15,360
gone five minutes five minutes hope this

534
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,009
is a terrible estimation on Sam's part

535
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:18,600
because even before getting sucked into

536
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,250
the game Alan had time to finish his

537
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,750
meal and pack all the things to prepare

538
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,579
to run away talk to Sarah at the door

539
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:25,110
and start playing the game which would

540
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:25,920
take much longer

541
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,939
holy smokes Alan they're not there how

542
00:16:29,939 --> 00:16:31,230
does she know without going up to the

543
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:33,120
attic to check game can literally reset

544
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,889
time and counter people and animals out

545
00:16:34,889 --> 00:16:36,689
of thin air surely transporting Judy and

546
00:16:36,689 --> 00:16:38,970
Peter to 1969 isn't outside the realm of

547
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:40,860
possibility here just go freaking look

548
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,380
to be sure jeez kids say hi to mr. mrs.

549
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,449
perish in the original timeline the kids

550
00:16:45,449 --> 00:16:46,860
moved to this small town because their

551
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,480
parents died in Canada but how did they

552
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,860
end up here in this timeline it's not

553
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,420
like Alan could reverse-engineer their

554
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,800
origins he didn't even know their last

555
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,730
name there gonna be a debate now about

556
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:58,410
whether or not Jumanji is a Christmas

557
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:00,709
movie because I'm sick of that die hard

558
00:17:00,709 --> 00:17:03,420
I swear to God if Dwayne Johnson isn't

559
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,980
wearing a beret and eating croissants at

560
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:10,400

563
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,730
wouldn't be Who I am today if it weren't

564
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:23,150
for my years there but I don't want your

565
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:23,839
life

566
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,720

568
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,150

572
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:52,900
