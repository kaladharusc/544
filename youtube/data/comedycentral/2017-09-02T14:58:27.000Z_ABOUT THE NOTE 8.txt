talk about my new cellphone I got the

00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,750
note e now the only review anybody's

7
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:37,370
really interested in when it comes to

8
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,080
the note e is the note 8 versus the

9
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,960
iPhone 8 which I happen to have right

10
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,210
here I'm just kidding this is because

11
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,010
the new iPhones not out yet and that's

12
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:47,780
really all I care about is this versus

13
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,040
the new iPhone I'm not gonna do a

14
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,080
comprehensive review instead think of

15
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,120
this is like a first look and then I

16
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,100
want to tell you why I like phones and

17
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,430
computers with stylus is stylized stylus

18
00:00:58,430 --> 00:00:59,600
and as always in the name of

00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,190
transparency please know that this

20
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:03,680
review is extremely biased while I was

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,930
not hired or paid by Samsung to make

00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:07,880
this video i have worked with samsung in

the past I work with Samsung in the

sighs now the note 8 is objectively a

27
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:34,230
gigantic gigantic phone it's the biggest

28
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:36,540
phone that I could find in my arsenal

29
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,790
it's huge in a kind of direct

30
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,920
side-by-side comparison it's a little

31
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,950
bit bigger than the s8 plus it's a lot

32
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,550
bigger than the s8 regular it's a lot

33
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:50,070
bigger than an iPhone 7 I don't have an

34
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,140
iPhone 7 plus but that's like you know

35
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,270
that's like this big good like swallow

36
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:59,940
an iPhone 5 it's big but I wouldn't say

37
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,860
it feels too big in the hand in fact it

38
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,110
feels really good in the hand and my

39
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,090
jeans which fit pretty tight so slides

40
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:07,920
in there nicely you know it's a big

41
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,020
phone but compared to like what we have

42
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,300
in our pockets anyway but the feel the

43
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,580
feel is really good it has like a heavy

44
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,370
density to it a robustness to with it it

45
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:24,010
feels good

46
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:26,080
what I do want to talk about is the idea

47
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,590
of a big-screen phone with a stylus for

48
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:43,090
me that's the magic recipe I don't know

49
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:44,110
why I think it's probably like the

50
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,670
tactile nature being able to actually

51
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:48,489
use my hand to draw something if you

52
00:02:48,489 --> 00:02:49,720
notice I've been doing some of my vlog

53
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,760
credits in my own handwriting I've been

54
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,099
doing that on my iPad using procreate

55
00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:56,739
it's amazing quick aside Apple there's

56
00:02:56,739 --> 00:02:59,109
nowhere to put this $100 pen you can

57
00:02:59,109 --> 00:03:01,750
sort of put it there but like where is

58
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:02,620
it now it's gone

59
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,849
I don't understand that I've had to buy

60
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:05,500
three of these things so far Samsung

61
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,970
gives you this little sleeve which isn't

62
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:09,010
so pretty but it's functional and then

63
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:10,209
on the surface I got this really

64
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:12,010
confident inspiring magnets things not

65
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:13,629
going anywhere but Apple where am I

66
00:03:13,629 --> 00:03:15,400
supposed to put this thing I think a big

67
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,200
part of it is that I've got really fat

68
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,329
fingers look at the size of my fingers

69
00:03:19,329 --> 00:03:21,639
they're like hot dogs and that's not a

70
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:24,099
big deal what I'm trying to touch use

71
00:03:24,099 --> 00:03:25,750
the touchscreen on a smaller phone like

72
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,250
this like look how much of my fingers

73
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,290
are too fat if you're inarticulate

74
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:31,480
non-specific like I disagree with Steve

75
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,030
Jobs on this one who wants a stylus you

76
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,379
have to get them and put them away and

77
00:03:35,379 --> 00:03:38,079
you'll lose him yuck nobody wants a

78
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:39,940
stylus but the stylus whether it's on an

79
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,980
iPad or a tablet or on a phone it

80
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,510
enables like another level of

81
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:45,519
interaction I wish that this laptop had

82
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,349
a touchscreen because and that Final Cut

83
00:03:47,349 --> 00:03:49,120
Pro was optimized for like stylus

84
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,739
because if I could interact with my

85
00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:53,199
media when editing video like this

86
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:56,079
instead of down here with this I feel

87
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:57,820
like to be much more effective

88
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:06,490

Chris nice to meet you Chris it's more

92
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,450
than just the stylist

93
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:20,890
I like the stylist the stylist is

94
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:23,110
important when you combine the stylist

95
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,490
with having something that fits in your

96
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:54,700
hand like a notebook

97
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,080
but it's more than just a detail

98
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,240
think of it typing for example or data

99
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,840
entry on a phone without a stylus

100
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,020
without a stylus this is how you type

101
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:07,880
with a stylus this is how you type and

102
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,160
to me that's a more elegant or organic

103
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,870
way of interacting with something it's

104
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,400
exactly how I write if I had a notebook

105
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,440
and a pen and then if you take that idea

106
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,060
and you don't just look at typing but

107
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:20,840
you sort of look at tip photo editing

108
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,240
for example there's this because precise

109
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,640
and it's almost like using a mouse and a

110
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,550
cursor and then this we're like fat

111
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:30,020
fingers get in the way of whatever I'm

112
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:43,850
trying to do this thing that seems done

113
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:45,770
so it's actually integrated across the

114
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:47,240
software here which makes it is that I

115
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,919
should caveat that by saying I still

116
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:51,230
haven't really used this thing but the

117
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:53,030
note 7 when they recall that was my

118
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:56,620
favorite phone ever

119
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:00,360
I do I do thank you very much

120
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,639
Donna thank you see what I want when I

121
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:06,310
walk from a phone it's perfect more like

122
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,770
a computer

123
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:11,320
remember the palm treo that phone had a

124
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,260
keyboard and a stylus that felt like a

125
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:17,800
little computer I mean nothing stuck

126
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,870
compared to today's phone standards but

127
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:22,500
the way you interacted with it was more

128
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:27,599
computer-like than this

129
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:31,569
go into our Santa Monica see you can get

130
00:06:31,569 --> 00:06:32,979
worked on these things just by using

131
00:06:32,979 --> 00:06:34,930
your thumb and hammering away but in a

132
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:36,729
pinch it does act like a computer you

133
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,830
can actually get work done so that's it

134
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,719
my thesis is more based on like the note

135
00:06:40,719 --> 00:06:42,729
as a phone less than this specific once

136
00:06:42,729 --> 00:06:44,110
I've actually played with this much yet

137
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:47,349
but I hope it makes sense and it is like

138
00:06:47,349 --> 00:06:49,449
my my favorite phone I'm happy to have

139
00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:56,199
it back maxie you see it do we have the

140
00:06:56,199 --> 00:07:00,070
same shirt on
