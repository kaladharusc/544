1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:38,940
you're too heavy I typically get running

2
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,430
shoes three pair at a time see I've got

3
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:44,280
a metal leg flat feet and I run I land

4
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,070
on my heels so these shoes look good see

5
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,899
that see how the heels all melted away

6
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:50,550
you don't want to run on shoes like this

7
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,280
because it can mess up your home so once

8
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,410
every six months so I have to get new

9
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,360
shoes today's the day three new pair

10
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,020
showed up

11
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,359
I wear a parent next day rotate next day

12
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:02,520
rotate back to the first pair and repeat

13
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,750
this is something that a pro Runner

14
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,369
friend taught me you see that the foam

15
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:07,710
in the shoe it doesn't recover in a day

16
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,299
it needs a couple days to recover after

17
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:11,820
a long run so you got a multiple shoes

18
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,400
so it is anybody who watches this show

19
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,700
care about this stuff

the bathroom the one where there was a

48
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,730
hole here that went into the room there

49
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:53,560
i'm happy to say the office is nearly

00:02:53,560 --> 00:03:01,380
complete ready first time ever

[Music]

56
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,989
see as of two weeks ago when I announced

57
00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:24,489
this new series and I announced the

58
00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:26,170
whole 368 initiative and all of our

59
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:28,690
ambitions at that time all that existed

60
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:31,269
was a big empty space and an idea and in

61
00:03:31,269 --> 00:03:33,489
the last two weeks it's evolved to a big

62
00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:35,409
empty space with some construction work

63
00:03:35,409 --> 00:03:39,099
done and a slightly more mature idea see

64
00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:40,959
when building something that has the the

65
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,079
scale the ambition of what I and soon we

66
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:46,390
are trying to do here at 3 6 8 it

67
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:47,980
obviously takes time but there's also

68
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,720
there's also a structure to how that

69
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,250
time is spent and what the priorities

70
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,959
are initial priorities in here are

71
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,370
making it so we can actually work in

72
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:56,470
here hence the office being nearly done

73
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,150
and then another priority that's at the

74
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:00,760
very very top is the team and we have

75
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,590
made some progress on the team not ready

76
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,000
to announce yet but there's a couple of

77
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,549
key people that are now on or close to

78
00:04:06,549 --> 00:04:07,930
being on that will help me run and

79
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,819
realize that the mission and and just

80
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:13,750
operate this its operation what has been

81
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,359
particularly interesting to me are what

82
00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:18,519
aspects of three six a people have been

83
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:20,049
responding to the most whether it's on

84
00:04:20,049 --> 00:04:21,430
social media or in the comments on

85
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:23,830
YouTube the one thing that stands out is

86
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:27,099
this idea of enabling and helping small

87
00:04:27,099 --> 00:04:29,289
creators which is something that I'm

88
00:04:29,289 --> 00:04:31,570
tremendously passionate about but seeing

89
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:34,539
out people react to that has been well

90
00:04:34,539 --> 00:04:37,270
it's been overwhelming overwhelming for

91
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,950
a lot of reasons overwhelming because I

92
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,930
know how to help creators when it comes

93
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:43,930
to creators that maybe I stumble upon or

94
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:45,460
seek me out that are just making

95
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,950
incredible work I get excited and I talk

96
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:50,139
about them and I share them with this

97
00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:52,330
audience they grow because of that that

98
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:54,039
is not something that's scalable

99
00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:55,780
plugging people on this channel is not

100
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,610
an effective way to grow a lot of people

101
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:58,870
so figuring out what that infrastructure

102
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,460
might look like what this idea of

103
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,010
enabling others might actually feel like

104
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:05,440
might actually be like that's something

105
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,490
that I've been spending a lot of time

106
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:07,810
thinking about and that is something

107
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:10,570
that I think the future of 368 could be

108
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:12,789
instrumental in the planning and the

109
00:05:12,789 --> 00:05:14,979
execution of every aspect of three six

110
00:05:14,979 --> 00:05:16,240
ages compartmentalised

111
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,099
one piece get it done they move on to

112
00:05:18,099 --> 00:05:19,360
the next they move on to the next they

113
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,160
move on to the next you build something

114
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,020
small you see if that works you add on

115
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,760
to that you see if that works you add on

116
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,320
to that you see if that works you add on

117
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:26,650
to that

118
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:28,300
that's the effective way to build a

119
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,580
business and that's exactly

120
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,550
trying to do at 368 the hardest part of

121
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:34,710
that for me is that it doesn't make for

122
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,330
really interesting content I mean to

123
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:37,979
show you the nuances everything is

124
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:39,990
transpiring in 3 6 8 every single day

125
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:42,509
would be about the video equivalent of

126
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:45,210
showing you paint dry the steps are all

127
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:47,849
tiny but in aggregate they're meaningful

128
00:05:47,849 --> 00:05:50,280
all things start small all great things

129
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,770
start small cicero said that and that is

130
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,780
that's that's what's going on right now

131
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,430
at 368 from both the physical

132
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:58,710
perspective and an ambition that you do

133
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:00,689
it in an ambition perspective and

134
00:06:00,689 --> 00:06:02,370
everything in between but the train is

135
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:03,690
moving forward we've got greater

136
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:05,340
direction and understanding now and it

137
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,289
seems like it feels like every day that

138
00:06:07,289 --> 00:06:10,199
passes by we have more clarity on how to

139
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:12,360
execute on what we're trying to

140
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,130
accomplish

Jesse I got a serious question for you

143
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:33,720
yes all right I know I've been yapping a

144
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,180
lot today but I think it's time for me

145
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,010
to answer the question that every single

146
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:40,050
person the question that every single

147
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:41,820
person on Twitter and in the youtube

148
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,770
comments and everywhere else has asked

149
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:50,760
which is why the suit there is not much

150
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,260
of an answer like there's not much of a

151
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,480
reason for me wearing a suit I guess it

152
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,150
goes like this well you know what come

153
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:03,270
here bring it when I was thinking of

154
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:06,270
starting 3 6 8 and in starting a new

155
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:09,050
Daily Show here I knew there'd be no

156
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:12,360
disassociating this new daily vlog with

157
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,520
my daily vlog from the past that's why

158
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,170
all of you know me in the first place is

159
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:17,820
from that vlog how does this feel

160
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:21,120
different so one idea I had was like

161
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,820
what if at the beginning I'm always

162
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,850
wearing a suit and then at first glance

163
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:29,340
you know that this is 3 6 8 and not the

164
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,560
vols ok that's kind of it it's like

165
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,670
there's not much more to it than that

166
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:38,530
yes I'm a fan of Reservoir Dogs

167
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:40,820
yes I think it's cool that the Yakuza

168
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:46,610
wear the same outfit no I don't think

169
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:47,660
it's cool that when I go to restaurants

170
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:53,700
people think I'm a waiter

171
00:07:53,700 --> 00:08:00,790
no it's not really comfortable and then

172
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:02,980
yesterday this is embarrassing but

173
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,750
yesterday yesterday Candice finally

174
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,420
admitted to me that uh she doesn't find

175
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,910
the suit to be handsome anymore so that

176
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:12,040
was kind of it I'm sorry there isn't a

177
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,840
more intellectual response for why I'm

178
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,980
wearing a suit there's not there's

179
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,540
really not much more to it I think now

180
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,710
that I've told you that I can probably

181
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:21,130
stop wearing the suit I'm I am worried

182
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:22,270
that once I don't have the suit on

183
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:24,040
there'll be some confusion as to what it

184
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:30,640
is you're watching but see this is from

185
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,380
the old vlog so I think you're gonna get

186
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:37,540
compute there better awesome I know

187
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:38,860
I'll check I'll tell you all about this

188
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,290
soon see I got a serious question for

189
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:45,090
you yes should I put the suit back on

190
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:47,470
people were starting to like question

191
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,180
the suit and I'm doing a lot of peer

192
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,680
pressure to stop wearing it what do you

193
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,100
think

194
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,830
don't stop the suit because you want to

195
00:08:53,830 --> 00:09:00,910
save out but every day looks good what

196
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,560
about this sweatshirt this is more like

197
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,900
that's nice too they give you one of

198
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:09,070
these yet no yeah no yeah

199
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:18,410
