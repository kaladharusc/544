aspect of that I've just been absolutely

15
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,770
failing at is showing them good places

16
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:51,090

delicious but if I keep on eating like

30
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,310
this I'm gonna be like Rob - I'll see

31
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,380
you at 360 trying to keep away from

32
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:53,820
existentialism John and Earth are trying

33
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,620
to keep away from issues flip on the off

34
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:02,770
since walk in the park of discovery I

35
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:06,230
will now read a monologue I didn't write

36
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:11,280
this monologue but it's pretty spot-on

37
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:11,880
[Applause]

38
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,380
[Music]

39
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,430
so the person who emailed me this

40
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,930
morning with a perfectly nice request

41
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:20,810
I'm sorry to say the answer is no you

42
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:21,980
didn't do anything wrong you were

43
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,570
perfectly respectful within your rights

44
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:25,220
to ask about arranging a time for a

45
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,590
meeting see but the problem isn't you

46
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,780
there's something wrong with me I have a

47
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:32,810
form of anorexia don't be alarmed it's

48
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:34,790
not serious although I take it quite

49
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:37,100
seriously in fact in fact I think it's

50
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,800
the secret to all of my success I have

51
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,340
calendar anorexia I want as little in my

52
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,170
calendar as possible I'm meticulous

53
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:47,000
about it whatever the least amount

54
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,560
possible I can have in my calendar

55
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,960
without killing my entire career that's

56
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,670
what I want I want to set up quick call

57
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:54,350
to chat want to have coffee next week

58
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:57,050
let's get together to discuss no no and

59
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:00,440
no I could but I just can't even if

60
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,090
there are serious opportunities even if

61
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:04,220
the only take me 15 minutes even if it's

62
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,650
something that everyone else does I like

63
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:08,540
to avoid it of course I'm not perfect at

64
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,280
this I do succumb just like everybody

65
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,690
else in the modern world there are

66
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,489
things that I have to do and and those

67
00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:14,930
things have to be scheduled there are

68
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,760
requirements for work and basic civility

69
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,760
but even then when I pull up my phone

70
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,320
and I click on today's date and I see

71
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,330
little boxes of time blocked out I get

72
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:25,430
very nervous I get anxious what is all

73
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:25,730
this

74
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:28,010
where did my time go what about my day

75
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:31,790
why did I agree to all of this and then

76
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:34,489
the most fearful question how will I be

77
00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:37,459
able to make my video you see my entire

78
00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:39,590
day is my vlog time I can't schedule

79
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,269
that and if I do schedule that away it

80
00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:43,250
better be because I'm getting paid or I

81
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,930
really want to do it because everything

82
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,880
else everything else is for suckers

83
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,650
see you've got managers and you got

84
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,209
makers there are two ways to run your

85
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:51,890
life managers know that their days

86
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:53,750
divided up into little itty-bitty pieces

87
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,459
for meetings calls and administrative

88
00:03:55,459 --> 00:03:57,840
tasks makers on the other hand

89
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,430
makers need to have large blocks of

90
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:01,739
uninterrupted time to focus on what it

91
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:03,569
is they're making when people ask how

92
00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:05,099
I'm able to get these videos done every

93
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:07,440
single day my calendar and erect SIA is

94
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,129
the answer

95
00:04:08,129 --> 00:04:09,480
same goes the house able to manage a

96
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,160
healthy relationship with my wife and my

97
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,349
family and how I manage to exercise and

98
00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:15,780
read time time is our most irreplaceable

99
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,120
asset we can't buy more of it we can't

100
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,190
get a second of it back we can only hope

101
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,720
to waste as little of it as possible

102
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,080
while we have it yet somehow we treat it

103
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,180
as the most renewable of all resources

104
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,889
so if the ask is if we can get together

105
00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:32,040
and chat or pick my brain the answer is

106
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,400
no I'm sorry but I have this condition I

107
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,000
hope you understand okay I didn't write

108
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,150
that it's not amazing my friend Ryan

109
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:44,040
Holliday is a brilliant writer he's the

110
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,610
one who wrote that he's good so I said

111
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:48,210
hi

112
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:50,490
and while I'm not as Extreme as like

113
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,289
that letters written there's a lot in

114
00:04:52,289 --> 00:04:54,000
there that I do agree with after time

115
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,320
with my family and focusing on my family

116
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,080
this blog is my number one priority and

117
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,699
it does make it hard or frustrating

118
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:00,150
what's up

119
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:02,850
harder frustrating to try and have

120
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:04,470
meetings or give time to everybody who

121
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,020
asks for some of my time but every once

122
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,220
in a while there's a really good

123
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,590
exception to that rule

124
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:12,240
what's up Casey my name is jack conte I

125
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,310
am the CEO of patreon but actually this

126
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,800
is not a patreon video this is just me

127
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,840
and you I've got an idea

128
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,930
and I want to talk to you

129
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:28,380
[Music]

130
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:31,120
this is it Casey this is it I'm asking

131
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,830
for 50 minutes of your time just you and

132
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:36,100
me so I can explain this idea and I hope

133
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,440
you're down because I already bought my

134
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,410
plane ticket so if you're not I'm gonna

135
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:44,169
be really lonely on Thursday in New York

136
00:05:44,169 --> 00:05:46,870
if you are down just write a comment in

137
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,669
this youtube video that just says yes

138
00:05:48,669 --> 00:05:50,139
and I'll figure out how to get in touch

139
00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:55,720
a few up that video was made by a guy

140
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,970
named jack conte now I don't know Jack I

141
00:05:57,970 --> 00:05:59,680
don't know who he is I've never met him

142
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,750
as far as I know I've never seen the guy

143
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,310
before and before I could gather from

144
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:05,560
that video he wants something from me

145
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,850
but that video was just so so good that

146
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:11,740
I got to meet the guy how good was it

147
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,150
well it was so good that the video

148
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:15,669
itself went viral it was so good that he

149
00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:18,010
recruited people all over the internet

150
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,710
to petition me just to go meet him it

151
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:24,160
was so good so good that the man right

152
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:34,410

158
00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:53,560
video that's that good to get my

159
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,380
attention well ultimately what I want is

160
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:59,080
I want creative people to be valued what

161
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,380
they're actually valued at I want I want

162
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,060
there to be a zero gap between what a

163
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,310
creative person is worth and the money

164
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:08,139
that they are given by the world

165
00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:11,169

235
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:14,930
[Music]

236
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:17,730
so this is the main space and obviously

237
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:18,870
we're gonna use this space for like

238
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,760
collabs and just like a party space in a

239
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:24,540
physical space up here there that's with

240
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,120
no no behind you that's where the office

241
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,470
is being built see them up there the

242
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,240
constructions almost done up there

243
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,260
progress is being made

244
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,990
dude it's so weird to actually be here

245
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:35,790
so you can imagine like this is where I

246
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,410
wanted to podcast and set up back here

247
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:39,240
out there I don't know but I feel like

248
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,620
downstairs is about post-production

249
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,080
clean organized and upstairs about like

250
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,660
horsing around and action you can see

251
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:48,990
the vision right baby's down you know

252
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:50,640
like the office is built the office is a

253
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,130
reality now and then we're gonna start

254
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:54,420
working on down here and then upstairs

255
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,100
and then and how long is it going to

256
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,900
take to actually get the facility up and

257
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,540
running weeks and months but not longer

258
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,920
than that this isn't a this isn't a

259
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,840
five-year plan this is like a couple

260
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:15,180
month to it glad somebody else

261
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:21,130
appreciates this phase as much as I do

262
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:25,160
so I think while the good news is I

263
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,140
don't know it's not that we have a deal

264
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,160
or don't have a deal

265
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,510
but what Jack came here to present is

266
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:31,730
wildly exciting and I could see it I do

267
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:34,700
see it I want it to be a big part of

268
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,950
three six eight future so what do you

269
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:39,500

future of 368 and what we could do

273
00:11:48,589 --> 00:12:00,790
