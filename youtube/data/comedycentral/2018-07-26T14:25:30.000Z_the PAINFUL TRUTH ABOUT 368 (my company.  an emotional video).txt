slimy day today in New York City the

city's not so fun when it's raining up

8
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:37,320
can't do anything the paint stripping

9
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,850
gum and it drives the pants pretty

10
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:40,829
quickly fell then one spot for too long

11
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:42,820
my pants will literally catch on fire

12
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:43,280
[Music]

13
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,140
[Applause]

14
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,760
now I'd like to have just a little bit

15
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,850
of a heart-to-heart with you if that's

16
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:57,720
up oh what's up I was just about to have

17
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:01,710
like a heart-to-heart no you saved yeah

18
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:08,970
you look good dad it's easy to like

19
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,939
brush off bad YouTube comments like

20
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:13,590
people make fun of you people tell you

21
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,780
your videos suck people say unsub

22
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,090
because I didn't get all that stuff it

23
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,100
just rolls off your shoulder when you've

24
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,530
made a bunch of videos and have been

25
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,329
seeing it for years there's only one

26
00:01:24,329 --> 00:01:27,359
kind of comment that penetrates that

27
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:30,350
like and those are the comments that

28
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:33,240
confirm your worst suspicions those are

29
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,340
the ones that like that actually speak

30
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,929
the truth so I bring this up now because

31
00:01:36,929 --> 00:01:38,909
I'm always seeing a couple of comments

32
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:42,179
that are like three six eight is bullsh

33
00:01:42,179 --> 00:01:44,009
I thought it was gonna be this big thing

34
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:45,780
you're still just making regular videos

35
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,700
and sometimes you hang out in there that

36
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,299
hurts it really hurts because it's not

37
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:53,909
the truth but it's also kind of how I

38
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:56,609
feel like I when I first announced three

39
00:01:56,609 --> 00:01:58,109
six eight it was this huge initiative

40
00:01:58,109 --> 00:02:03,149
and I've done really nothing as far as

41
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:05,039
you know the reality of it is that

42
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:07,109
building a business is a really slow

43
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:10,170
really painful process and we are

44
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:12,720
working full full full steam ahead and

45
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,700
we're doing incredible initiatives we

46
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,860
have like a youtuber incubator program

47
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,420
we're gonna bring together small

48
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,790
youtubers it's very exciting we have

49
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:23,220
like businesses built into it that our

50
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,960
early generating revenue we have the

51
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,800
three six eight gaming

52
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,120
which is happening and then the biggest

53
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,370
speed bump at all is this the space 368

54
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:32,290
at its core as I pitched it all revolves

55
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,300
around the nucleus which is this

56
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,580
physical space in downtown Manhattan the

57
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:38,710
space still isn't done and we're doing

58
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:39,910
everything we're throwing money at it

59
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,500
we've spent just maybe even over a

60
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,570
hundred thousand dollars working on that

61
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:45,820
space like we're investing heavily in

62
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,770
that space it's just not there yet we're

63
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:49,540
almost there like look this is what the

64
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,980
space looks like today today is July

65
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:54,670

67
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,110
literally what it looks like right now

68
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:01,120
like this is the current level of

69
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,830
construction in the front space this

70
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:16,600

00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:45,030
[Music]

80
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:50,950
it's good it's hotdogs sorry guys we're

81
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:53,530
building good stuff so this wow I

82
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:56,650
haven't seen the lighting yet so this

83
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,660
space out here is gonna be the retail

84
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,150
space like this room is open to the

85
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:04,090
public this here is gonna be the sales

86
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:04,960
desk

87
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,990
see how it's uncomfortably high mm-hmm

88
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,910
we want it to be really unwelcoming

89
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,710
basically like yeah we want people to

90
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,840
come up and kind of have the desk come

91
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,250
to their chin and then they feel awkward

92
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:20,739
and small yeah just be like intimidation

93
00:04:20,739 --> 00:04:21,970
yeah we don't want people to hang out in

94
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,200
here so we thought we'd make it as

95
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,330
unfriendly as possible but that's that

96
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:29,590
this is the creator space back here and

97
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:32,470
this whole space is meant to be modular

98
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:35,320
or really a halfpipe here when my

99
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,310
friends come around town they're like

100
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,110
how do I get around New York City and

101
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,960
now I can just be like here follow my

102
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,830
super 73 as we got 10 of them you have

103
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:48,410
one of these right

104
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:51,420
[Applause]

105
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:56,640
peekaboo mechanically much

106
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:02,490
[Music]

107
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:05,440
that whole thing moves again because you

108
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,000
just explained the whole business model

109
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,380
four three six eight in the most poetic

110
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,430
okay okay okay

111
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:16,510
go so it's it's the Medici family of

112
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:19,480
Florence so they basically made their

113
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,550
money in banking and I've been studying

114
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,620
them for about ten years trying to

115
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:26,230
figure out how to build the creative

116
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:29,370
model because this is a family who had

117
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:33,460
Galileo and and Michelangelo and some of

118
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:36,120
the greatest artists of all time

119
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,800
don't worry don't worry guys I'm

120
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,470
dropping gems over here don't worry the

121
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:44,110
the three six eight is very similar to

122
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:48,700
that idea in the structure and so if

123
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,840
you're talking about moving to Los

124
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,580
Angeles I want us to figure out how we

125
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,960
can do something together because I've

126
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,430
been trying to build this forever three

127
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:57,190
six eight west coast but I think right

128
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,340
but Moore's more what's really exciting

129
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,140
is that if we get this right the next

130
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:05,280
Michael it the next Michelangelo YouTube

131
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:21,200
exactly

132
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,460
how do we end this how do we end this

133
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:27,180
segment you're not man sometimes you

134
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:32,730
just allow things to gently go their own

135
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:35,070
way you know you don't want to say

136
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:37,290
goodbye you don't you don't want to say

137
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:39,840
so long you just want to like is this

138
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,040
just what you do when you don't have an

139
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:49,140
ending for something yeah well he's good

140
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:51,750
he's good he's good you know what this

141
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,040
social media thing doesn't work out you

142
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,440
should be an actor

143
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:13,740
[Music]

144
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:17,170
2006 the year that Will Smith's The

145
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:21,070
Pursuit of Happyness came out you want

146
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:24,880
something go get it period maybe my

147
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,110
favorite Will Smith movie ever so this

148
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:30,910
is a story that I told will today but

149
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:32,830
when I first moved to New York City I

150
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:35,950
lived in an SRO like a single room

151
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:38,260
occupancy it was a place had no bathroom

152
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,300
and no kitchen was a shared bathroom not

153
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:43,810
a great place to live and I used to ride

154
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:46,300
my bike almost every day like from where

155
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,950
I worked all the way downtown all the

156
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:51,370
way up to with this huge heavy bag with

157
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,470
like all my camera gear in it and then

158
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:55,870
this camera gear was like this burden it

159
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:58,000
was like this weight I knew that that

160
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,540
burden on my back was going to be what

161
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,580
set me free like what all my dreams

162
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,919
could come true if I just believed in

163
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,960
this thing Chris Gardner was doing his

164
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,889
best but his fast

165
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:13,680
wasn't enough in that movie invest all

166
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,939
this money into these like heavy

167
00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:17,219

whole savior like the only way he's

169

a couple years later and I sort of found

174
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:31,710
my footing and just like bawling my eyes

175
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:35,550
out for that entire movie because I saw

176
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:37,950
so much of myself in that main character

177
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:40,560
as this struggling single father who who

178
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,260
knew that he could find his way and and

179
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,250
achieve what he wanted to achieve in

180
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:47,329
life for himself and his family and and
