4
00:00:24,969 --> 00:00:29,809
this is the DJI spark come DJI spark 5

5
00:00:29,809 --> 00:00:32,840
combo fly more combo pack this is the

6
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,149
official DJI spark I did do an earlier

7
00:00:35,149 --> 00:00:36,800
video about the spark but that was with

8
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,260
a prototype unit this is the official

9
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:41,749
shippable unit as it will appear in

10
00:00:41,749 --> 00:00:44,089
stores biggest detail here in this box

11
00:00:44,089 --> 00:00:46,550
is the controller for the spark now for

12
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:48,530
this video we comparing the sparks with

13
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:50,989
the controller to the DJI Mavic with

14
00:00:50,989 --> 00:00:52,399
controller I do want to make it

15
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:53,569
abundantly clear before I begin this

16
00:00:53,569 --> 00:00:55,729
review that I'm not being paid by a I've

17
00:00:55,729 --> 00:00:57,890
never been paid 5 DJI this is an

18
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:59,809
impartial review but I'm a huge fan of

19
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:02,359
DJI so it's sort of like a little bit

20
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:06,460
bias because I like the product so much

21
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:23,270
first the unboxing documentation this is

22
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:26,720
the actual drone battery extra

23
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:32,120
propellers solar propeller guard charger

24
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:38,200
AC adapter the charger that's everything

25
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,110
the bag yet the case yet the drone

26
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:43,360
itself eight I think eight propeller

27
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,120
blade or propeller guards you get the

28
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,979
charger and get two batteries and I

29
00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:49,300
think it maybe even comes with an SD

30
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,190
card this is six hundred ninety nine

31
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:52,990
bucks seems like a good deal

32
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:55,060
now one interesting kid that I did want

33
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,770
to zero in on be consisting is all about

34
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:58,810
portability is this is the case it comes

35
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,520
with this is the case you need for the

36
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,810
battery for the charger for the

37
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:03,070
controller for everything

38
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:05,619
this is the case that the Mavic prompted

39
00:02:05,619 --> 00:02:07,540
now the Mavic is a considerably bigger

40
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:10,000
drone them the spark but at the end of

41
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,500
the day you need all this stuff with you

42
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,760
so you're carrying it all in the case

43
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,370
matter case spark case they're almost

44
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:17,560
the same size they're going to take up

45
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,030
almost the same amount of real estate in

46
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:19,930
your backpack

47
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,850
that's an interesting consideration okay

48
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,709
let's get into this then this is the

49
00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:25,989
controller for the DJI spark and this is

50
00:02:25,989 --> 00:02:27,540
a controller for the Maverick both

51
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,430
extremely similar looking devices I will

52
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:32,769
say this one feels the spark one feels a

53
00:02:32,769 --> 00:02:34,060
little bit lighter and like maybe a

54
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,250
little bit cheaper feeling and the spark

55
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,340
does not have this LED readout the nabek

56
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,320
controller does have now without having

57
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,880
actually use this yet I can tell you the

58
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,709
LED readout is not super critical

59
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:46,450
because you always use these controllers

60
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:48,579
of the phone information presented on

61
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:50,769
this LED readout is redundant to the

62
00:02:50,769 --> 00:02:53,500
phone not entirely necessary I think

63
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,360
they put it on the Maverick because they

64
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,590
intended for people to use the

65
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,329
controller without a phone but who wants

66
00:02:58,329 --> 00:03:00,040
that you can't see the picture to lay

67
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,799
out the same buttons are the same got

68
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:05,200
these great little x-wing fighter arms

69
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,230
here and that's where you stick and

70
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:11,530
that's where you stick the phone

71
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:16,870
I do want to say as a very strong aside

72
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:19,569
DJ I made a lot of fuss about the fact

73
00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:21,040
that you can control these and they're

74
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,470
fully operational using justa phone you

75
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,209
can also use hand controls things like

76
00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:27,280
that I think that's great whatever it

77
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,989
feels a little bit like a gimmick to me

78
00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:30,850
I want to use a drone to take beautiful

79
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:32,860
aerial cinematography whether it's a

80
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,810
tiny drone or a big drone and when you

81
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:36,880
just have a phone you're trying to use

82
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,010
essentially buttons that have this kind

83
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,180
of tactical feedback

84
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,950
you're trying to emulate that using

85
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:44,800
nothing but a touchscreen it's imprecise

86
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,360
on top of it being harder to control

87
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,830
because of the lack of buttons and this

88
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:49,420
is a really big deal when you're using

89
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,010
your phone it's nothing more than the

90
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:53,470
Wi-Fi signal from your phone so the

91
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,840
range is severely limited every time I

92
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,850
use the spark using just my phone it was

93
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:00,069
never able to get more than really like

94
00:04:00,069 --> 00:04:03,670
70 or 80 feet away from me now in the

95
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:06,640
box here are these propeller guards they

96
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,370
attach on something like this propeller

97
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:11,620
guards are really great for two things

98
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,930
that if you're a total novice a total

99
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:15,519
beginner they will protect your drone

100
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,169
and two if you're flying indoors in

101
00:04:17,169 --> 00:04:19,390
really tight quarters they'll also be

102
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,400
helpful there and not really for me

103
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,110
though

104
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:30,240
[Music]

105
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,560
for the extra light test I'm going to go

106
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,380
outside to a more open safe location but

107
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,930
now I've had this spark prototype for a

108
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:39,610
few months one aspect of the sparked

109
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:41,020
it's sort of hard to capture the review

110
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,630
like this is how quiet and discreet it

111
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,400
is even thematic when you fire that

112
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,160
thing up it does a super fit and it acts

113
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,250
a crowd and then it grew loud but the

114
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,919
spark is quiet and small and somewhat

115
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,070
innocuous people see it as a toy instead

116
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:59,889
of a my single favorite feature of the

117
00:04:59,889 --> 00:05:01,690
spark and this may seem silly but this

118
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:03,880
is a big deal for me is the fact that

119
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,460
you can just plug a microUSB cable into

120
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,289
the spark itself in charge of the

121
00:05:08,289 --> 00:05:10,330
battery portable battery charger plug it

122
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:11,710
in this thing is charging right now

123
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:14,020
that's a big deal it can be charging in

124
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:14,919
my backpack

125
00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:16,419
alright so this is me setting up the

126
00:05:16,419 --> 00:05:18,190
controller for the DJI spark for the

127
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:23,110
first time you have to go into your

128
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:25,539
phone and like literally connect to the

129
00:05:25,539 --> 00:05:31,210
Wi-Fi it doesn't say the password button

130
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:33,539
below the password to the Wi-Fi

131
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:36,220
perfectly Wi-Fi password is located

132
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,780
under the stickers that are basically

133
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:40,599
inaudible okay I think I've got it just

134
00:05:40,599 --> 00:05:43,120
you know that took me 20 minutes to

135
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,070
figure out that whole setup process was

136
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:47,440
confusing and frustrating and took a

137
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,419
long time but I'm hoping maybe that's

138
00:05:49,419 --> 00:05:50,919
just because it was the first time that

139
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:52,659
I did it now at a time for a long

140
00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:54,639
awaited flight test now what I'm going

141
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,949
to try and do is do some complicated but

142
00:05:56,949 --> 00:05:59,050
beautiful cinematography with the drone

143
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:00,720
and then try to replicate that

144
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,190
cinematography with thematic compare the

145
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:07,490
two shot

146
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:09,260
so cute

all right I do have to say responsive

151
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,669
responsiveness feels fantastic the image

152
00:07:45,669 --> 00:07:47,440
preview quality that you get on the

153
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,349
screen right here is dynamite my

154
00:07:50,349 --> 00:07:52,770
complaints about radio versus Wi-Fi are

155
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:55,629
unfounded it's really really good and

156
00:07:55,629 --> 00:07:57,970
the drone is way the hell out there

157
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:00,250
one of the biggest technical hurdles of

158
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,500
the spark versus the phantom or any of

159
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,599
the other DJI drones is that this only

160
00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:06,430
shoots in 1080 that's the highest

161
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:08,650
resolution thematic issue ting natively

162
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:10,960
in 4k now if you're watching this back

163
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,370
on a cell phone you might not be able to

164
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:14,680
tell but watch it back in 4k on a big

165
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,759
monitor you'll be able to see the

166
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:28,700
difference and it's it's significant

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,360
okay despite all my bitching about that

169
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,800
Wi-Fi nonsense that was pretty

170
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,780
incredible I think it way further than I

171
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,670
had expected the image quality on this

172
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:13,700
thing was amazing and

173
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:20,000

174
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,370
all right so in conclusion biggest

175
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:24,410
concerns with this were around it's like

176
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:26,720
fly ability how easy is it to control in

177
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,280
the air because on the phone they kind

178
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,800
of suck using the controller it's

179
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,200
perfect it's ace it's everything I

180
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,960
wanted it's incredible controls are

181
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,850
tight they're if they're specific it's

182
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:39,770
responsive it does exactly what you want

183
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:41,900
it to do it just kind of leaves one big

184
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,090
question which is the million dollar or

185
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:46,670
a 300 Oller question which is for $6.99

186
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,590
for the whole package do you get this or

187
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:49,910
for 9.99

188
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:51,950
to get the whole package of the mavet

189
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:55,250
and I think it if you're a novice if

190
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,380
you're new to drone this is the way to

191
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,060
go save the money and this thing is

192
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,070
amazing if you've had any experience or

193
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:02,780
you have bigger aspirations for what you

194
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,940
can do with the drone spend the extra

195
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:08,210
money get the Mavic you won't have any

196
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:10,580
regrets both so are great options for

197
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,470
drones and I will never stop being

198
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:21,320
impressed and just how tiny you give me

199
00:10:21,320 --> 00:11:10,000
