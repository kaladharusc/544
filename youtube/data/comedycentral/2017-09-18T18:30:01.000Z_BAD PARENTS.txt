00:04:18,729 --> 00:04:30,580
brother-in-law my favorite was the

91
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,560
Little Mermaid because Francine thought

92
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,690
that Ariel's name was areola how did she

93
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:38,300
learn that

94
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:44,970
[Music]

95
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:48,360
we can explain it but I can't correct it

96
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,940
it's so funny the first day was like

97
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,200
amazing we got there late in the

98
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,660
afternoon we had a half a day and it was

99
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:58,140
smooth as butter so this is just this is

100
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,720
just the first day we didn't get into it

101
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,870
to like 4 or 5 p.m. so just stuck a few

102
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:07,080
rides in we saw the frozen show tomorrow

103
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,760
is gonna be like the real hard-hitting

104
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:20,450
Disney day

105
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:24,240
so this is it this is the both our last

106
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,010
day and our first real day here at

107
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:29,190
Disneyland we had breakfast this morning

108
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:33,930
with Chip and Dale is pretty exciting so

109
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,400
far I think the whole thing is off to a

110
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,190
very very good

111
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:40,020
Stanly 70th birthday seems site the

112
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:43,020
babies seem happy yeah so far sweeping

113
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,600
success and then the second day was sort

114
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,440
of an unmitigated disaster she was tired

115
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,820
friends who just freaking out the entire

116
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,220
time I would figure she did like it's a

117
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,350
small world she did like it she's good

118
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,670
like if she said she wanted to do it

119
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:57,750
again when we got out

120
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:04,039
[Music]

121
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:06,349
the neethu reason why this video is

122
00:06:06,349 --> 00:06:09,529
click baited as bad parents is because

123
00:06:09,529 --> 00:06:11,360
we do spoil her too much and I think

124
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,919
this might be like the height of

125
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:14,689
spoiling her we justified it as

126
00:06:14,689 --> 00:06:16,849
Candace's dad's birthday but we just

127
00:06:16,849 --> 00:06:18,529
didn't want to let her down so instead

128
00:06:18,529 --> 00:06:20,119
of being rational humans and postponing

129
00:06:20,119 --> 00:06:22,309
the trip we got in a plane and flew that

130
00:06:22,309 --> 00:06:23,749
day to Disneyland

131
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:25,009
then everybody had such a good time

132
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:29,119
great trip still get out of 70 years of

133
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,770
birthdays is this the greatest one

134
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:34,219
you've ever used it really is it's a

135
00:06:34,219 --> 00:06:36,199
good one right so that's kind of it that

136
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:38,360
was our whole Disney trip and we still

137
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,580
do want to go on a Disney cruise but

138
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,349
like I think for toddlers the cruise

139
00:06:42,349 --> 00:06:44,349
must be just amazing

140
00:06:44,349 --> 00:06:46,879
we'll go we'll go we're gonna go we're
