1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:11,070
you think you'd be happy there sure I

2
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,509
think I'd be happier there than I would

3
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:16,859
be in LA I'm a hundred percent certain

4
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:19,650
I'd be happy now Candace wants to move

5
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:23,039
to Texas we don't first of all we only

6
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,689
be two and half hours from a family

7
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:27,599
are we getting coffee yeah actually yeah

8
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:38,489
I know this conversation about leaving

9
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:39,750
New York City and moving somewhere else

10
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,280
to be going on for a really long time

11
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,489
but with baby watermelon it feels like

12
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:47,879
it's more serious now I do think in two

13
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:49,710
years time there's very little chance

14
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,140
we'll still be living in this city with

15
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:58,330
two kiddos and just be a lot thank you

hours a day seven days a week for seven

24
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:53,250
straight years Marlin Candice was upset

25
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,450
because you're the one of the first

26
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:55,920

28
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,540

half a human I know are you gonna do

52
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,010
like a rose petals on the bed kind of

53
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,870
thing like a romantic when you see here

54
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,819

61
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,940
really it's like the healthiest healthy

62
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,100

63
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,670

00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:17,220

67
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,260
that was for false starts now I can

68
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,080
start tech review Tuesday dan roll the

69
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:26,120
intro

70
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,830
today in tech review Tuesday we're gonna

71
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,990
talk to cell phones now I'm gonna be

72
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:34,790
reviewing the one plus six which I just

73
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:37,250
got not even opened yet

74
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,860
before I do my general thoughts on cell

75
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:44,860
phones as of June 2018 goes like this

76
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,449
my favorite mobile phone operating

77
00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:51,440
system is pure Android running on the

78
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,900
pixel 2 but I still carry an iPhone

79
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,910
because an iPhone has iMessage and

80
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:58,430
FaceTime which are the best messaging

81
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:00,229
and video television

82
00:05:00,229 --> 00:05:03,470
on the market also the iPhone goes to

83
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,210
the Apple watch which integrates pretty

84
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:07,220
well with the running apps that I use my

85
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,650
favorite cell phone camera is the

86
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:11,990
samsung galaxy s 9 it's the best low

87
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,850
it's just the best cell phone camera on

88
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:16,100
the market right now but it's still not

89
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,930
my favorite phone my favorite phone is

90
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:20,030
still the Samsung Note 8 and it's the

91
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:22,910
best because because it has a stylus and

92
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:24,380
S Pen and it operates more like a

93
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,960
computer than a phone and that makes it

94
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,830
my favorite now a look at the 1 plus 6

95
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:47,080
[Music]

96
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,340
right off the bat it's got one Hardware

97
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,720
feature that I think should be required

98
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,720
on every phone made and that has a

99
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,000
physical switch that takes it from

100
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,770
ringer to vibrate we're reaching a point

101
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:02,090
with cell phones where at least from the

102
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:04,789
front they all looked the same just kind

103
00:06:04,789 --> 00:06:07,070
of slide the glass curve the glass back

104
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:09,889
on the oneplus does feel pretty sexy

105
00:06:09,889 --> 00:06:12,110
it's got a notch in the top right there

106
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:14,450
like an iPhone one thing it does have

107
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:16,010
that super interesting is that when you

108
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:18,200
use the provided charger this thing goes

109
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,120
from zero to a full day's charge in 30

110
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,979
minutes at least that's what they say

111
00:06:21,979 --> 00:06:24,500
just a quick thought for all cell phone

112
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,260
manufacturers on planet Earth we as

113
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:30,289
consumers will always prefer a slightly

114
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:32,990
longer battery life to a phone that's

115
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:35,190
like a millimeter thinner

116
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:44,790
okay let's compare the size differences

117
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:48,900
here are fairly negligible this is the

118
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:52,350
one plus now as I was setting up the

119
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:55,290
phone to go to a quick photo test I set

120
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,660
up the facial recognition the facial

121
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,670
scanner the face to unlock like the

122
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:00,750
iPhone 10s

123
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,370
it seems pretty great seems to work

124
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:05,100
about as well as the iPhone 10 one thing

125
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,780
it does have that the iPhone 10 does not

126
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:10,020
have though is a fingerprint scanner and

127
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,630
addition to the facial scanning so I

128
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,400
like the idea of having that the

129
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,230
redundancy in case I've got glasses or a

130
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,390
motorcycle helmet or something blocking

131
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:21,660
my face there's still the fingerprint

132
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:34,650
scanner there now this is by no means a

133
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:37,920
super comprehensive camera quality test

134
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,560
but there's some amazing light out this

135
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,480
afternoon so I'm just gonna take the

136
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,160
same picture across these four phones

137
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,460
that's the pixel to excel the iPhone 10

138
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:53,040
the Samsung Galaxy S 9 and then the one

139
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,620
plus 6 and I can't stress how lovely the

140
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,940
light is right now so I'm sure all these

141
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,960
pictures gonna look great okay

142
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:27,840
[Music]

143
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,280
this is more of a challenging lighting

144
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,750
condition this is to test out the

145
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,090
dynamic range

146
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:34,429
minigolf

147
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:54,759
[Music]

148
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:56,899
all right now I'm gonna do an indoor

149
00:08:56,899 --> 00:08:59,269
test I just need a I'll go get another

150
00:08:59,269 --> 00:09:04,670
juice so the lighting in here is like

151
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:07,699
your typical indoor lighting so let's

152
00:09:07,699 --> 00:09:14,150
let's just

153
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:33,140
the hard one

154
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,130
all right so this would be the last

155
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:37,670
photo test I do this is just your basic

156
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:40,950
selfie photo nothing special about this

157
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:44,160
I'm just gonna turn it on selfie smile

158
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:59,790
and take a picture all right and that

159
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:02,040
concludes the photo test portion of this

160
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:10,560
review I gotta say out of this go back

161
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,339
to the studio

162
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:14,670
so overall the camera's not bad I think

163
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:16,770
that compared to the pixel 2 or the

164
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:20,550
iPhone 10 or the Samsung S 9 it's not

165
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:23,370
quite as good these are the top cell

166
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:24,720
phone cameras on the market right now

167
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,570
and I think the the 1 plus 6 is is good

168
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:28,980
it's definitely good enough it's

169
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,380
definitely better than most cameras of

170
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,560
last year's generation but it doesn't it

171
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,150
doesn't take the prize for the best

172
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,680
camera on the market

173
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,740
so in conclusion in conclusion is that

174
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,709
this is not a fully comprehensive review

175
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:45,360
this was more of an unboxing because I

176
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,940
just got this thing I'm going to take my

177
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,250
sim card out of this and put it into

178
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,320
this to test it out for the next week or

179
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,750
so and I'll do a little update not as a

180
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,430
tech review Tuesday but just as like a

181
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:58,440
part of a different episode to let you

182
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,380
know what I really think of this cell

183
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,480
phones remain my single favorite piece

184
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,790
of technology if you're interested in

185
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,980
working in media youtuber filmmaker

186
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,110
photographer you can literally build an

187
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:12,089
entire career using nothing but your

188
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:13,529
cellphone's alright I'll see you

189
