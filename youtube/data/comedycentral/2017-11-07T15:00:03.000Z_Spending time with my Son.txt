that stems from my life's mission and my

34
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,620
life's mission is to as an adult realize

35
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,570
all the promises that I made to myself

36
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:46,340

41
00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:55,680
time with the kid but I should be able

42
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,480
to piece together a nice story without

43
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,430
messing with my precious father-son time

44
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:06,380

[Music]

46
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,910
now I've been a parent for the last 19

47
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,740
years just being a parent's easy and it

48
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,060
makes sense when you have a cute little

49
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:20,380
little baby but now he's like this man

50
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,990
this like 19 year old adult who's taller

51
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:24,550
than me and better looking than me and

52
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:26,380
smarter than me and more articulate them

53
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,240
and I like keep catching myself just

54
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,990
staring at this kid being like I made

55
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:34,230

when you're a dad and you visit your kid

58
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:50,950
at college you have to buy them things

59
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:54,320
so right now we're gonna buy Owen a new

60
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,030
skateboard this is kind of a cool thing

61
00:03:56,030 --> 00:04:04,900
to buy them

62
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,640

70
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,240
we weren't able to get a skateboard at

71
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,320
the other store

72
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:08,830
so Owen brought us to downtown but just

73
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:11,110
been sitting here and I think I can move

74
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:16,030
like three feet I think we're good now

76
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:31,060
as parent it's in your DNA to take care

77
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,850
of your child but but when they live

78
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:35,530
3,000 miles away you only see them have

79
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:37,450
a couple of months it's hard to do that

80
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:38,730
so now that I'm here I'm

81
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:41,500
overcompensating by buying you designer

82
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:49,800
sunglasses and $8.00 pairs of underwear

83
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:54,250
those right there in the middle the dark

84
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:57,760
wolf picks up a promising trail droplets

85
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:01,090
of blood from an injured elk this could

86
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:04,090
feed her back for several days unlike

87
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:06,760
the pop of wolf and I raised my tub or

88
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,950
my wolf puppy and he gets bigger and

89
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,990
stronger I teach it I teach it how to

90
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:13,030
fight and I teach it how to forage and

91
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:14,980
how to eat and how to survive but

92
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,810
eventually have to set that little puppy

93
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:19,030
at the inexperienced youngsters wait too

94
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:22,120
dark for smooth free to go out into the

95
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,920
world and hopefully make it a better
