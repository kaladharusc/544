1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,720
I gotta start off today's gotta start

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,069
off today's episode a little bit of a

3
00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:07,680
serious talk this morning at like 10:30

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,860
11 I got a text from one of the guys

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,019
that works for me and it said just FYI

6
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:15,150
there's someone outside your door he

7
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,190
won't leave I had to call 911 one

8
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,680
somebody showed up here they were able

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,970
to get into this building this is a

10
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,260
locked and secure building but they

11
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,699
probably snuck in behind someone else

12
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:25,650
they came to outside my office door

13
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:26,880
right here what you see behind this

14
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,310
monitor and then they just refused to

15
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,949
leave and Dan showed up and actually

16
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:34,050
kind of interacted with the guy and film

17
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:35,730
the guy on a phone I'm gonna show you

18
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:37,710
what it looked like but please know I'm

19
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,750
pixelating the guy and I'm trying to

20
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,120
alter his voice because I would assume

21
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,739
he's doing this for attention and the

22
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:44,610
last thing I want to do is give him

23
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:46,050
attention but this is what it this would

24
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:47,910
look like by breaking into someone's

25
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,449
night you know welcome yeah dude I don't

26
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:53,370
care you can't do this you sent me an

27
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:56,039
example of what not to do I'm like nah

28
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:58,109
you are no one has ever made it by

29
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:00,390
breaking in a walking of nobodies in

30
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:04,229
though this is a building with a closed

31
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:06,420
door and a locking key and you snuck in

32
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:07,229
the front door

33
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:08,939
and you came up the stairs you're making

34
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:10,950
yourself look really stupid in front of

35
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:12,450
a bunch of professional people here that

36
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,700
are trying to work look at me okay see

37
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,830
you're not gonna come in if you if you

38
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,140
look at me yet look at me you gotta go

39
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,040
you gotta go

40
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:26,460
the doors over there look at me I know

41
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,900
you're trying to be case you talk to

42
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,759
Casey you gotta wait downstairs like

43
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:30,710
everyone else

44
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:34,320
so I appreciate dan I appreciate Sam I

45
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,780
appreciate Patrick for trying to get

46
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:37,950
this guy out of here and do the right

47
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,500
thing ultimately the police did have to

48
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,340
come we did file a proper police report

49
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,939
here the crime is criminal trespassing

50
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:50,040
look I don't know if this guy wanted to

51
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,600
hurt me if you wanted a selfie with me

52
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,890
have no idea what he wanted but when

53
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:54,509
he's confronted by three people who

54
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:56,189
clearly know me he refused to leave

55
00:01:56,189 --> 00:01:59,640
showing up at my office as public as I

56
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,409
make the address showing up here is just

57
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:03,299
not appropriate one thing that happens

58
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:05,399
often there makes no sense to me as a

59
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:07,200
parent makes so no sense is when parents

60
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,119
drive down here and sit here with their

61
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,739
children to wait for me to come out of

62
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:12,380
my office

63
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:14,330
I love meeting people see me in the

64
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:16,790
street make sure you say hi but in an

65
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:18,560
environment like this is just wildly

66
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,819
wildly inappropriate so this was a kind

67
00:02:22,819 --> 00:02:25,580
of a scary situation but just in general

68
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:28,550
I just please be respectful of my office

69
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:32,360
space in positive news though we are

70
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,340
going to build like a retail we're gonna

71
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,410
build like a public space in some part

72
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:38,750
of 360 a space that will be open and

73
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,489
have some sort of normal hours so if you

74
00:02:40,489 --> 00:02:42,110
are in New York you can come visit and

75
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:43,459
that is appropriate and it's a space

76
00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:45,830
that I control it doesn't disturb my my

77
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:48,380
neighbors this guy's this guy's not

78
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,959
invited okay now I will start the vlog

79
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,690
how to vote ideas you've had this was by

80
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:56,470
far by far the worst idea

81
00:02:56,470 --> 00:03:07,109
[Music]

82
00:03:07,109 --> 00:03:11,079
you've got action and you've got intent

83
00:03:11,079 --> 00:03:13,359
without intent there can be no action

84
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:16,840
but without action intent means nothing

85
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,299
you see my biggest frustration with 368

86
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:21,579
the series this show is that I want to

87
00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:22,900
share with you all the intimacy's of

88
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,269
what's going on at 368 but company 368

89
00:03:25,269 --> 00:03:27,730
the factory 368 this whole thing that

90
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:30,129
I'm trying to build here but it's a slow

91
00:03:30,129 --> 00:03:32,680
process with 35 days in there's a lot

92
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,930
happening there's a lot of there's a lot

93
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:37,720
of action happening but I only like to

94
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,329
share with you the action because to

95
00:03:40,329 --> 00:03:42,790
share the intent well I don't know about

96
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:43,989
you but I find it frustrating when

97
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:45,579
somebody says to me I'm gonna do this or

98
00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:47,590
I'm gonna do that instead I prefer to

99
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:49,239
back off and then bring you back in when

100
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:51,310
there's some action to show you so let

101
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,129
me share a little action with you

102
00:03:53,129 --> 00:03:55,030
probably the biggest thing is what's

103
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,950
happening behind me here see we can't

104
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,840
open up this entire space to the public

105
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,219
because well we're trying to work in

106
00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:02,650
here but we want to build a space in the

107
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,329
very front of the store want to build a

108
00:04:04,329 --> 00:04:06,489
space that's like you know we have hours

109
00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:07,989
and maybe it's open one day a week or

110
00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:09,190
maybe it's open two days a week then

111
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,299
maybe it's open more than that I don't

112
00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:11,470
know but a space that people who come in

113
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,269
to want to have a merch store in here we

114
00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:14,470
want to have like an won't have a space

115
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,729
where you can do like installations

116
00:04:15,729 --> 00:04:17,260
video installations art installations

117
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,609
who know that's happening in real time

118
00:04:18,609 --> 00:04:21,519
this this this is an action not intent

119
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,110
it's not we're gonna do that we are

120
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:25,210
doing that not sure what the signs for

121
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:27,370
but it's just so cool we kind of had to

122
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,199
have it this I guess is probably more

123
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,659
like intent than action just this isn't

124
00:04:31,659 --> 00:04:33,280
really relevant to this this video it's

125
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,870
awesome they're right

126
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,880
Charlie sure what it's for but we can

127
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,590
easily take a picture of every visitor

128
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:41,330
we have in the space just to sort of

129
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:45,680
track things it's a cool project this is

130
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,350
our jump bike rack jump bikes are

131
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,610
motorized bikes that you just sort of

132
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:50,990
rent or borrow right around the city

133
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,940
there's a lot more happening with jump

134
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:55,430
bikes but I can't share it yet I'm going

135
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,229
to save the intent but I shared the

136
00:04:57,229 --> 00:04:59,080
action

137
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:05,370

the office the office is not as all

141
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:18,229
about intent this is where action takes

142
00:05:18,229 --> 00:05:20,360
place every single day the planning the

143
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,969
plotting the future 3 6 8 it all happens

144
00:05:22,969 --> 00:05:25,669
right here the other thing that's

145
00:05:25,669 --> 00:05:27,770
happening that's very exciting is the

146
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:30,620
team the three 618 is being built out we

147
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,870
currently have five people that work for

148
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:35,029
three six eight and soon you'll be

149
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:36,409
introduced to them right now it's so

150
00:05:36,409 --> 00:05:38,779
kind of well there's like there's a lot

151
00:05:38,779 --> 00:05:40,639
of like HR stuff there's a lot of good

152
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:41,809
reasons why you haven't met them yet

153
00:05:41,809 --> 00:05:42,860
you'll meet them soon

154
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:46,580
five people it's happening this is the

155
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,289
location of what will be our second

156
00:05:48,289 --> 00:05:50,330
podcast we're trying to avoid that diner

157
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:52,759
motif here because ultimately it will be

158
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:55,339
a talk show that we put most likely on

159
00:05:55,339 --> 00:05:57,740
YouTube or somewhere else but this is

160
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,969
that it's being built the first

161
00:05:58,969 --> 00:06:01,249
recording will most likely be this week

162
00:06:01,249 --> 00:06:04,789
so it's happening action so that's it

163
00:06:04,789 --> 00:06:06,559
that's the update of three six eight a

164
00:06:06,559 --> 00:06:08,270
