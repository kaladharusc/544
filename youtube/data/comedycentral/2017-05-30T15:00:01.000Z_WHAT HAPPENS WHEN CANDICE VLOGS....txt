00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:31,439
I think two days ago or three days ago I

2
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,110
posted my like initial like first look

3
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,230
review of the new little spark throne

4
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:38,820
this is gonna be like a reoccurring

5
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:51,989
theme in the blog because this is after

6
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:53,879
spending three additional days of it

7
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:56,489
since the review I still stand by it as

8
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:58,829
like an incredible incredible piece of

9
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:01,260
hardware and I still like I don't have a

10
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,940
controller for it I'm still using my old

11
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,159
iPhone there isn't even an Android app

12
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:07,650
for me to use my galaxy with it that

13
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,689
limits it on top of that I'm using beta

14
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:11,909
software that limits it I only have one

15
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:13,470
battery and despite all those

16
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:21,810
shortcomings it's still amazing last

17
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:22,950
thing I'll say about it so to start my

18
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,689
day this thing is pretty tough I don't

19
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:26,009
have any extra propellers or anything so

20
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:27,270
I'm trying to be careful with it not

21
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:29,970
break it but I did crash it into a tree

22
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:32,550
at full speed

23
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:46,180
[Music]

24
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:50,300
and it was windy out there too and it

25
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,500
handled the wind like there was no

26
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,080
problem you know because my drones are

27
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,310
so big and they take up so much space

28
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,720
and they're such a liability

29
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,520
I've been much more cautious with the

30
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,860
where and the when of using them in the

31
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,720
vlog that's why there's been a lot less

32
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,250
drone footage unless I'm in a place

33
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,500
that's like big and open but this is

34
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,700
going to let me shoot in places I've

35
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,400
never shot before

39
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,849
I mean in the history of ever

40
00:02:52,849 --> 00:02:56,450
could could you imagine a drone that I

41
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:58,280
can fly out of my studio door down the

42
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,780
hallway say hi to my friends and fly it

43
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:07,069
back into the studio aren't the most

44
00:03:07,069 --> 00:03:10,700
boring there was boring thing the least

45
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,709
interesting thing I've ever done in the

46
00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:16,879
history of the blog was was when I

47
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,340
brought the vlogging camera and you the

48
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,920
audience with me on jury duty that was

49
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:29,720
pretty boring today's goal is to break

50
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,670
the vlogging record for most boring

51
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:35,720
thing ever vlog that's your cue to stop

52
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:43,700
watching right now so yeah boring I have

53
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,170
to go to the Department of Motor

54
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:49,609
Vehicles in New York City to change the

55
00:03:49,609 --> 00:03:51,560
address on my driver's license like

56
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,840
which is not going to be exciting this

57
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,669
is not going to be fun I appreciate it

58
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:58,860
if you're still watching at this point

62
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:38,940
miserable failure not like a update it's

63
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,270
a transfer and without the right I

64
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:44,820
failed I do not have a new drivers life

65
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:55,500
I hate the DMV I hate the DMV very true

66
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,870
story I was so upset like frazzled and

67
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:00,360
frustrated because of the DMV situation

68
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,640
I was like kid I'm not shooting a video

69
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,650

Dan

72
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,250
I was out with Candace and she had this

73
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,020
funny idea and she said shoot and it

74
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,250
kind of felt like that was enough to

75
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:21,310
call this an episode we're funny getting

79
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:51,290

00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:54,380
done one of these on the channel this is

81
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,580
a sour

82
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:59,210

mega sour warhead eating contest they

84
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,470
used to be called mega sour warheads

85
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:09,560
when I was a child now I don't really

86
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,600
like sour stuff especially these it is

87
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,400
more like on the chemically side for me

88
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,190
I'm not really into the typical content

89
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:21,530
