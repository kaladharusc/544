fight if I'm gonna be honest with you I

91
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:52,210
didn't shoot anything for the rest of

92
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:53,650
the day and then I cut it and I was like

93
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:56,169
that's not a full episode so I shelved

94
00:06:56,169 --> 00:06:58,720
it and then I was like it was kind of a

95
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,340
good day though and it was beautiful and

96
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:03,639

even though I feel like it was a weak

103
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,479
story it lacks the depth that I aspire

104
00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:22,349
