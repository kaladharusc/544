just like to thank my sponsor SeatGeek

34
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:09,290
for making this entire thing happened

35
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:11,420
SeatGeek is an app that aggregates

36
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,160
tickets to live events across the

37
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,050
interweb and then they tell you if it's

38
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:16,819
a good deal or not and they also have

39
00:03:16,819 --> 00:03:18,260
tickets to events that you can't get

40
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,510
that are hard to get to also when I

41
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:21,920
called them and pitched it on this crazy

42
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,630
movie idea to go to this game with my

43
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:25,610
best friend they made it happen so I

44
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:26,959

70
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,350
running we both got that but with the

71
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:59,280

specifically planned kind of a bummer we

81
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,570
brought to boosted boards but the snow

82
00:05:37,570 --> 00:06:00,400
