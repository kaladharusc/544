1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:05,910
success on YouTube still means a life of

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,370
poverty I'm reading to you from from

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:12,090
Bloomberg this is the lead of the

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:13,380
article this is the first sentence in

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,269
the article do your children dream of

6
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:18,420
YouTube stardom do them a favor crush

7
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:25,019
that ambition now this is an article

8
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:26,810
it's actually not a bad article in

9
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:29,310
Cristo Coll Walker I don't actually mean

10
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,019
it's about new research out of Germany

11
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:33,600
build as among the first to review the

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,250
chances of making it in the new

13
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,920
Hollywood ie making it on YouTube it

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,180
presents all kinds of objective data

15
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,710
like 96.5% of all of those trying to

16
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,960
become youtubers won't make enough money

17
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,090
off of advertising to crack the US

18
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,910
poverty line most of the story is about

19
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:53,579
objective data that quantifies just how

20
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:55,170
challenging it is to succeed on this

21
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,149
platform this whole article starts from

22
00:00:57,149 --> 00:00:58,980
the premise that the only reason why

23
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,780
you'd want to be on YouTube the only

24
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,370
reason why you want to be a youtuber is

25
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,680
because of the financial upside and I

26
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,080
think that's absolutely ridiculous

27
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,820
I think to make a statement like that

28
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,189
let alone write an article like this

29
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:14,180
with that being your foundation is

30
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:17,189
insulting to this entire platform I'm

31
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:18,479
not naive to the fact that a lot of

32
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,850
people see YouTube as a cash register I

33
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:23,159
also know that there are a lot of

34
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:24,750
creators I think the majority of the

35
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,250
creators that I've come in contact with

36
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,650
who are first motivated by their own

37
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:31,170
desire to make things in and to share

38
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,540
their own ideas and I do I think it is

39
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,689
that fact that motivates a lot of new

40
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:38,520
creators to come to this platform and

41
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,009
people who otherwise wouldn't be

42
00:01:40,009 --> 00:01:42,780
filmmakers or content creators or video

43
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,030
or TV people they're encouraged by what

44
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,549
they see here on YouTube to create

45
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:51,810
they're not just motivated by by a check

46
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,140
which is what this article kind of

47
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,729
insinuates that's my beef with the

48
00:01:56,729 --> 00:01:58,590
article I will link this article below

49
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,180
there's a lot of interesting stuff in

50
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,409
there I really recommend you check it

51
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:03,479
out please do not send the author of

52
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:07,439
this article any negativity I disagree

53
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,899
with his premise but I do appreciate the

54
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:12,250
article

55
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,320
well I got you here while I'm doing a

56
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,570
little talking ahead video I thought I

57
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:19,270
would address the new the new YouTube

58
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:21,070
Partner and monetization thing where you

59
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:23,020
have to have a thousand subscribers or

60
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:24,670
four thousand hours of watch time in the

61
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:26,200
past year to monetize your channel I've

62
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,940
seen especially since the Robert Kinsel

63
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,170
interviews so many people have

64
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:31,420
approached me about what are my thoughts

65
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,910
on this that follows socialblade on

66
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,380
Twitter and they've just been tearing

67
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:38,110
YouTube to pieces about this ready this

68
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:40,960
says today's the day YouTube is as we

69
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,480
tweet removing everyone from networks

70
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,430
and removing monetization options if you

71
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:48,220
fall below the 1000 subs and $4,000 of

72
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:50,650
watch time in the past 365 days if you

73
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:53,050
survive today congratulations

74
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:56,860
hashtag YouTube Partner culling ouch

75
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:59,050
first of all I hate I hate what this

76
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,540
says to small creators I hate this idea

77
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,580
that it says to you if you have a small

78
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:06,100
channel a tiny channel that your content

79
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,620
doesn't have value and while it sucks

80
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,630
and it may be challenging for you it

81
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:13,030
doesn't mean your work isn't of value

82
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:15,790
and I know and I like to think that

83
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:17,230
YouTube knows that the next big

84
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,239
generation of creators in this platform

85
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:21,310
are people who right now have less than

86
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:24,100
a thousand subs that's where it starts

87
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,650
anything that you really want life is

88
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:29,110
always really hard to get and and

89
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,750
YouTube is no different so the hurdles a

90
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,950
little bit higher now but the

91
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:34,959
opportunity is still there and I end

92
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,630
this by by bringing up my friend Peter

93
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:40,480
McKinnon Peter's a huge youtuber now he

94
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,790
has a million seven subscribers his

95
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:45,220
contents fantastic Peter's channels like

96
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,310
13 or 14 months old a year ago I didn't

97
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,050
know him a year ago he had a little over

98
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:52,209
a year ago he had zero subscribers he

99
00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:54,730
earned zero Adsense he had zero brand

100
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:57,250
deals he had no channel at all but he

101
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,870
started it he brought something new to

102
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:00,610
the channel he worked really hard he did

103
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,709
some interesting things to bring press

104
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,060
and attention to what he was doing on

105
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,860
the platform and now he is by all

106
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,739
definitions a successful youtuber so yes

107
00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:10,180
it's harder and it's only gonna get

108
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,250
harder the opportunity is still there

109
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,690
it's definitely harder to succeed on

110
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:15,850
YouTube today than it was yesterday it

111
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:18,489
was harder yesterday than it was 12 days

112
00:04:18,489 --> 00:04:20,019
ago or nine days ago before they started

113
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:24,130
this new policy but it's easier today

114
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,630
than it will be tomorrow

115
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:28,000
and it's definitely easier today in 2018

116
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,700
then it will be next year in 2019 and so

117
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,050
on and so on and so on

118
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:34,360
so if you're a dream let me rewrite this

119
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,940
article for it for this guy if your

120
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,370
children dream of YouTube stardom do

121
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:42,430
them a favor support that ambition now

122
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:45,160
if your dream is to be a youtuber do it

123
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,380
do not let this discourage you charge

124
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,870

125
00:04:49,870 --> 00:05:23,000
needs you all do not there is no try
