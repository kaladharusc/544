47
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:25,250
yes yes very good yeah ready whoa no no

48
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,069
can't touch that sweetheart

49
00:03:27,069 --> 00:03:30,379
that's called a switchblade come pitch

50
00:03:30,379 --> 00:03:32,120
me your movies I don't know what we're

51
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,739
making I can't okay

52
00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:36,349
the idea is ever since the first day I

53
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:37,910
arrived in US are we wearing the same

54
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:41,000
outfit every damned so the first the

55
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,769
first time I saw you unboxing something

56
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:44,540
and then and then I saw a camera falling

57
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,099
and the way that you interact with it

58
00:03:46,099 --> 00:03:46,669
and then us

59
00:03:46,669 --> 00:03:48,560
I saw the drone symmetry and all these

60
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,709
broken bits and pieces I was like

61
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:54,620
imagine the gear had feelings what they

62
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:57,199
would feel like okay and then I was like

63
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:01,159
maybe I should make a movie about how

64
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:03,829
the gear feels to be treated the way

65
00:04:03,829 --> 00:04:05,239
that it does and then I was like maybe

66
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:08,359
it's larger than that and maybe they

67
00:04:08,359 --> 00:04:11,090
behave a certain way because because

68
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:13,459
they they want something from you and

69
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:15,349
then I brought in Danny who's an

70
00:04:15,349 --> 00:04:17,000
animator and together we've kind of made

71
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,519
this this foam about like breaking down

72
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,710
the reasons why you treat your gear

73
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:25,169
completely differently to anyone else

74
00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:27,930
and I think we found out why and that's

75
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:29,909
kind of what the film is okay I'm

76
00:04:29,909 --> 00:04:32,520
excited it's nice it's like it's a

77
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,009
mystery movie but there's a lot of

78
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:37,220
realism like when you watch it you like

79
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:41,190
maybe that could be I do keep all of my

80
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:45,599
old broken gear see this here this is

81
00:04:45,599 --> 00:04:48,120
the drone cemeteries all my broken all

82
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,000
of these cameras here are indeed broken

83
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,340
all of these camera boxes are from

84
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:56,099
season one of the vlog that's what's

85
00:04:56,099 --> 00:05:01,080
