24
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,770
positive change of plans dan and I found

25
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,160
bicycles

26
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,420
Chicago is one of my favorite cities

27
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:53,160
because it has yeah okay you need to

28
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,220
look up what the blue mind theory is as

29
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:59,490
such being surrounded by a large space

30
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:02,640
of water actually brings your levels of

31
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,610
anxiety down that's why I search when

32
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:08,039
we're standing at the sea taking it in

33
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:13,110
quietly it takes away our stress it's

34
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,670
one of the reasons why we love the ocean

35
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:17,370
so much do you feel happier since we got

36
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:33,630
to the lake so much happy okay very

37
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,670
exciting because we're here in Chicago

38
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,830
and I don't really have anything to do

39
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,720

70
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,130
possible to make that place run like a

71
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:56,140
well-oiled machine when you have too

72
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,000
many people your responsibilities become

73
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,780
management instead of action and I hate

74
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,480
managing people okay this one is dear to

75
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,810

have your puppy in the office I just

82
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:23,280
don't know how to get a dog here from

83
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,450
he's an old man

84
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:26,860
okay there's been a lot of questions

85
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,230
about me sleeping continuously in the

86
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:31,120
vlog or looking like I'm half asleep hey

87
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,640
that's just me but also a fool sleeps

88
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,410
when he's tired and a wise man sleeps

89
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,990
when he can and I think that yeah 3 6 8

90
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:40,300
we pushing so hard every single day

91
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,070
every single second that I have the

92
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,900
chance to sleep even if it's on the side

93
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:44,729
of the pavement

94
00:04:44,729 --> 00:04:46,740
I take that opportunity will Candice

95
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,089
make more appearances on three six eight

96
00:04:48,089 --> 00:04:51,449

97
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:53,309
Sami I'm with you this is just a

98
00:04:53,309 --> 00:04:55,229
terrible haircut I had here the blonde

99
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:57,270

six eight

102
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:02,550
my goal for 316 is to have this be a 500

103
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:04,800
episode series which means one year from

104

what are your plans for YouTube damn I

106
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:10,979
think that I'm I'm super lucky to have

107
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:13,800
Casey as as a homie and I'm here kind of

108
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,330
learning from him which has been a crazy

109
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:17,129
experience and what I'm gonna do with

110
00:05:17,129 --> 00:05:18,659
all that knowledge within the next month

111
00:05:18,659 --> 00:05:20,699
I'm gonna start weekly uploading on my

112
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:23,879
channel will 3 6 8 be entirely edited by

113
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:25,860
Casey or will other creators upload

114
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,319
their content the mission is about a

115
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:31,080
space and is about collaboration but 3 6

116
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,300
8 the series this series this is my

117
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,430
series so you know I love collaborating

118
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:37,229
with people like Dan and in the future

119
00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:40,050
there'll be other collaborations but 3 6

120
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:41,999
8 the series will always be will always

121
00:05:41,999 --> 00:05:44,849
be my series ok last question here's a

122
00:05:44,849 --> 00:05:47,460
good one from Zack Bennett how do you

123
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,709
all foresee the content in 3 6 8

124
00:05:49,709 --> 00:05:51,060
different from that of the original

125
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,060
vlogs Zack I think it's very similar to

126
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,120
the original vlogs but the ambition is

127
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,159
very different I want to tell a much

128
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:01,289
bigger story than just my story with 3 6

129
00:06:01,289 --> 00:06:04,620
8 it's just going to take time 3 6 8 the

130
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,149
the vision the company that everything

131
00:06:06,149 --> 00:06:07,439
right now is nothing but an empty space

132
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:10,680
as my ideas start to become reality I

133
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,229
think you'll see this Daily Show going

134
00:06:13,229 --> 00:06:15,479
directions that take it that take it

135
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:18,270
away from what people came to understand

136
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,050
as the vlog

137
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:43,139
[Music]

138
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:47,970
Navy Pier I have no idea what that means

139
00:06:47,970 --> 00:07:07,430
[Music]

140
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,199
there's one more question that came in

141
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,520
that kind of broke my heart and I want

142
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,660
to address it goes like this

143
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,000
it's from smoking Joe how would I be as

144
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,380
good as you when my life isn't very

145
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,330
interesting and I can't afford decent

146
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:19,940
recording editing equipment I can't seem

147
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,949
to gain any growth after two years of

148
00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:24,620
hard work hard work and patience are

149
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,419
really what's required to find success

150
00:07:26,419 --> 00:07:28,850
in any field in life two years is a very

151
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:30,949
small amount of time and you gotta be

152
00:07:30,949 --> 00:07:32,510
prepared to commit everything if you

153
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:38,090
want to stick it out

154
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:41,240
do we have to get out I had such a good

155
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,360
answer to me creativity is the ability

156
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,880
to be able to believe in the way in

157
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,740
which you see the world so much that you

158
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,870
actually create an art format and from

159
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,690
what I understand like video is an is an

160
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:56,000
outlet it's a voice poems aren't outlets

161
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,580
music may be an outlet it's it's a

162
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,229
personal perception of the world and the

163
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:01,699
creation around that that becomes

164
00:08:01,699 --> 00:08:04,190
interesting and I think that like you've

165
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,630
