00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:08,610
Christmas no not per Casey nice that so

2
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:11,550
perfect you Casey that's me thank you

3
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:30,570
thank you very much I know what's in

4
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,610
this box but to make this scene really

5
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,739
climactic and dramatic I'm gonna pretend

6
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:43,160
I have no idea what's in this box that

7
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,770
might be wrong I didn't know I'm pretty

8
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,059
sure I'm right I'm pretty sure I know

9
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:50,489
exactly what's in this box to the ISTEP

10
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:52,440
family season's greetings from your

11
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,930
friends at Emirates Airline oh you guys

12
00:00:54,930 --> 00:01:02,039
know where I'm going with this one hey

13
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:08,790
that's pretty nice

14
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:27,510
[Music]

15
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:29,100
I don't want this to come across as

16
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,229
ingrateful at all Emirates but this

17
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:33,270
whole premeditated scene would have been

18
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,610
much more climactic if my actual plane

19
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:39,659
ticket had been in this package no big

20
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:41,220
deal though in the absence of come on

21
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,560
panasonic just focus just but the

22
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,420
absence of the ticket I can just explain

23
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,550
to you what happened or what's going on

24
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,350
like a year ago I flew into Emirates

25
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,210
from here to Australia or something like

26
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:51,570
that

27
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,130
and they gave me a free upgrade on a

28
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:54,990
ticket that I paid for like I paid for

29
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,850
this ticket I mean I didn't pay for it

30
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,410
the company that was flying me to anyway

31
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:00,270
this ticket was paid for but they gave

32
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:01,410
me a free upgrade to first-class

33
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:03,060
I made a video about sitting in the

34
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,440
first-class seat which I'm sure you've

35
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:12,420
seen sits done 47 48 47 million views

36
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,310
cut - a few weeks ago ICM Business

37
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:16,350
Insider that Emirates has this new plane

38
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:20,910
with an even sweeter first class I want

39
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,650
to fly in that plane now look there is a

40
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,450
good argument that just because I made a

41
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:26,010
video once and just because I harassed

42
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,900
them on Twitter I'm not entitled to a

43
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,540
free airplane ticket I agree I happen to

44
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,570
be going back to Dubai for work this

45
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,700
week so like all the moons kind of

46
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,440
aligned I got in touch they got in touch

47
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,940
with me via Twitter and they're like

48
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,430
yeah we can make it happen so I will be

49
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,989
flying on that ridiculous new

50
00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:45,750
first-class cabin very very soon there's

51
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,670
another tiny caveat here which is that

52
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,049
that plane doesn't actually fly from New

53
00:02:49,049 --> 00:02:51,390
York to Dubai so I'm gonna go all the

54
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:53,070
way out of our way to go to Brussels on

55
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:54,840
my way to Dubai just so I can fly this

56
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,900
new airplane just so I can make a video

57
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,830
about it this is very exciting for me

y'all black suitcases look exactly the

62
00:03:58,410 --> 00:03:59,580
same you gotta do something to

63
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:21,010
differentiate

64
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,840
excuse this non-sequitur but before I

65
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,750
embark on my voyage I want to talk about

66
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:30,740
YouTube for a minute the question I had

67
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:33,050
asked more than anything else about

68
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:35,600
YouTube is how do I make a successful

69
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,180
YouTube channel there is a very simple a

70
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,610
very simple answer to that do something

71
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:45,590
nobody else is doing and do it really

72
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:48,020
well but that's a hard answer to hear

73
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,389
because even though that's simple in

74
00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:52,610
concept and execution that is maybe the

75
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:54,620
hardest thing there is to do and it's

76
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,419
for that reason that I appreciate

77
00:04:56,419 --> 00:04:59,360
creators like like david dobrik who

78
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,220
introduced like an entirely new genre to

79
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:04,040
the the comedy space on youtube or like

80
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,990
my friend peter McKinnon who introduced

81
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:08,389
like a different production style to

82
00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:10,850
vlogging every once in a while there's a

83
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:14,720
unicorn that is someone I see on YouTube

84
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,430
who just like blows my mind a creator

85
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:22,370
doing something that is so new so fresh

86
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:25,370
that like it makes me question my own

87
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:27,830
creativity because it's not just a new

88
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:30,020
take on an existing genre it's not just

89
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,310
doing the same thing other people are

90
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,890
doing but better it's it's completely

91
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:41,060
new from every perspective so this is me

92
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:44,120
talking about my new favorite youtuber

93
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,340
her name's Ellie the mill as an amber

94
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:48,289
channel but she is someone who I think

95
00:05:48,289 --> 00:05:50,630
is pushing the boundaries of YouTube

96
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,370
creating content that's just brilliant

97
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:55,460
like really not just complicated but

98
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:57,710
very well done productions but like

99
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:00,350
really intimate and intricate and

100
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:03,640
brilliant narratives and subject matter

101
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,110
including like some of our more silly

102
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,820
videos that are just sort of like jokes

103
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,550
or pranks the complexity and depth with

104
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:13,100
which she approaches even that kind of

105
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,810
content is something that there is like

106
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:23,780
not a lot of on this platform

107
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:26,160
now when I try to think of what it is

108
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,289
that makes a creator like Elle so

109
00:06:28,289 --> 00:06:31,440
special it really begins with the way

110
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,419
she's able to authentically be herself

111
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:36,060
on camera I feel like the person I see

112
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,160
on screen is the person that I might

113
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,870
know in real life that's the kind of

114
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,910
thing that seems really really easy

115
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:44,970
there are very very few youtubers who

116
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:46,919
can do that well including me I struggle

117
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:50,099
being on camera the person that the

118
00:06:50,099 --> 00:06:58,470
person that I am in real life being

119
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:01,470
yourself well hard is one of the things

120
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:02,910
that you can do on YouTube to really

121
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:05,160
differentiate your content from other

122
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,930
people's people don't always copy your

123
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:08,550
style or your look but they can never

124
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:11,430
copy you being yourself sounds like it's

125
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,259
an obvious thing to do on the platform

126
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:16,110
but it's not and it's hard you see other

127
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,370
people other creators that are

128
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,220
successful you want to emulate them and

129
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,750
you end up you end up putting on a

130
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,340
facade of who you are end up

131
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,349
thank you you end up coming across as

132
00:07:25,349 --> 00:07:26,340
disingenuous

133
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:29,970
something you're not

134
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:33,879
so now if you see this video keep up the

135
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:35,919
great work you everyone a collab let me

136
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,419
know I just fly up to Canada and hang

137
00:07:37,419 --> 00:07:38,530
out with you or maybe you want to come

138
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:39,849
to New York City we could do something

139
00:07:39,849 --> 00:07:42,730
interesting together big fan here
