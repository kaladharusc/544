5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:18,690
smoking a joint right now so there's

6
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,029
this one thing I do in the summertime in

7
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:23,130
New York City and I I think of it all

8
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,439
year long and I do it every sunny warm

9
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,269
day in the city in the summer and it's

10
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:32,219
stupid but it's this it's not running

11
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:34,410
you already know how happy running mix

12
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,200
let's eat five miles from from my house

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,360
and where I start there are these rocks

14
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:50,430
and I get to these rocks and it's hot

15
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:54,390
it's like scalding hot like a hot to the

16
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,870
touch hot but I just lay here and I just

17
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:01,230
cook and I close my eyes but I just kind

18
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:04,199
of like meditate and think and focus for

19
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:06,930
like 20 minutes maybe it's the heat or

20
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:09,119
the Sun I don't know what it is but this

21
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,250
is a kind of focus I can never find in

22
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,840
life and then when I get so hot I can't

23
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:18,090
take it anymore run five miles home and

24
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:19,979
then I start my day but I start my day

25
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:23,610
feeling like fresher and newer than I've

26
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:31,170

27
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,530

that's gonna break that thank you I'll

34
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:53,340
see you later all right it's tech review

35
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,470
Tuesday and I have an idea wait I've got

36
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:58,259
a question my intro a secret no question

37
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:00,270
mmm in the video that you posted the

38
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,969
other day you were like really like sad

39
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:05,850
and upset you were like crying mmm this

40
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:09,000
is me and me being honest but I didn't

41
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,770
understand why you were so upset was it

42
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:11,190
really

43
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,680
about one video or is there something

44
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,270
deeper that you need to talk about I

45
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,070
don't know if I'm going through a downer

46
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,680
either I'm up oh I'm down this note like

47
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,360
there's no middle ground that's just me

48
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,580
I'm like one of those deeper dudes you

49
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,160
know wait are you down right now no I'm

50
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,400
up I think are you bummed out we like

51
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,170
talk if you know we're not to make

52
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:34,100
videos no Bria I like to make videos

53
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,260
okay so here's my idea since today's

54
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,900
tech review Tuesday Dan I was thinking

55
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,300
instead of like just reviewing a piece

56
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,060
of hardware I have an idea

57
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,910
every great TV show uses the same intro

58
00:02:47,910 --> 00:03:00,900
to every episode like so I want to have

59
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,660
a more consistent intro for this show

60
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,280
that's going to be the new three six

61
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,080
eight intro and I'm going to show you

62
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,750
how I do it what equipment I use and

63
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,760
that's gonna be tech Tuesday what do you

64
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:21,460
think oh I think it's good

65
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,990
all right so what's going on right here

66
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:27,020
is we put a cell phone with time-lapse

67
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:30,020
mode into this spinny it's called a

68
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,360
camel app egg timer it's an egg timer

69
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,670
cost 25 bucks then you turn your cell

70
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:36,380
phone on to time-lapse mode you hit

71
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,450
record it spins and captures a

72
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:40,850
time-lapse it's amazing it's dirt cheap

73
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:43,160
it looks like

74
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,830
[Music]

75
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:49,110
so that shot light captures New York

76
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:51,360
City it captures the movement that

77
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,430
happens here and that'll make up one

78
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:56,370
tiny piece of this new cinematic oh good

79
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:04,130
I'm getting on the boosted board okay

80
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:06,090
we're shooting something right now

81
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:09,030
that's like a moving time-lapse in front

82
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:11,160
of one of my favorite restaurants in New

83
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,530
York City Previn here is gonna shoot it

84
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:15,360
he's really good at this stuff and

85
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,299
basically I stand still the camera moves

86
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:20,850
around me and it's this time-lapse but

87
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:29,670
it's a really dynamic effect you go to

88
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:34,560
stay behind so now we're gonna go get

89
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,270
that exact shot in like two or three

90
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,490
more locations and stitch them all

91
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:52,770
together so it feels like a 360 all

92
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:54,690
right so we're gonna finish the 360 so

93
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:57,090
what we just shot was a 180 around me

94
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:58,770
and now we're gonna do the 360 around we

95
00:04:58,770 --> 00:04:59,760
were going to do this in front of juice

96
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,190
press so it looks like that Kinect on

97
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:05,880
180 and a 180 and you've got and then

98
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,890
you've got a full circle and a juice for

99
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:11,550
Dan I've gotten to know Casey pretty

100
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:13,830
well and he doesn't do well standing

101
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:14,960
throws

102
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,699
this is gonna be kind of hard for him

103
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:19,069
dude am I not in the shot I'm pretty

104
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:27,919
sure what do we do we go just now yeah

105
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:28,759
it's Ibiza

106
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:30,560
he's a sweat marks from a hard-working

107
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,370
South African male man

108
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:36,050
you notice there's like a lot of

109
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,690
friendly faces in New York City today

110
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:46,370
more than I've ever seen

111
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:52,960
you

112
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:58,580
[Music]

113
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,210
[Laughter]

114
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:03,710
talk me through this last effect we're

115
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,660
going to be doing here so imagine an

116
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:10,340
infinite zoom slowly but then you just

117
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,530
chop off the in and out points I don't

118
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:13,730
understand what you're talking about

119
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:15,230
there's nobody I understand what you're

120
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:17,360
talking about so like no no let's just

121
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,700
show show it again dad how are you do

122
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,760
that getting hit by a car really he's

123
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,040
doing a really long zoom zero then we're

124
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,510
gonna do another zoom down there I start

125
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:27,920
connecting the zooms together so you

126
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,230
look like it's zooming zooming forever

127
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:36,020
done guys so now we go one block closer

128
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,270
do the same shot when we stitch all

129
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,920
these together oh it's right here

130
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,710
okay then looking good okay so this is

131
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:44,690
going to be shot number two shot number

132
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:47,900
two of either three or four to take us

133
