row but Justin Elaine are kind of

51
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,700
experts on drone safety and what is

52
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,530
allowed and what is not allowed which is

53
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,780
why we're flying from flying from a boat

54
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:47,690
today what's happening I'm just setting

55
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:50,750
it up fine we're not flying yeah not

56
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,400
excited I'll tell you when we fly

57
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,890
promise it's a crazy thing I'm very

58
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:56,450
excited about this video we're gonna

59
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:04,400
make it work so talk me through some of

60
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,959
the legalities why are you allowed to

61
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:08,060
fly from a boat we're flying as friends

62
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,920
like this is essentially us out having a

63
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,900
good time so this is javi assists me and

64
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,390
Elaine like exactly we're flying for fun

65
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:16,160
we're also not flying over people we're

66
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,680
not flying in controlled airspace

67
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,079
what is this airspace so we're directly

68
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,789
over the Hudson we're outside of a

69
00:04:22,789 --> 00:04:24,590
Guardia JFK to YouTube for all that

70
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:27,050
stuff we're out of all of the aircraft

71
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:29,780
approached and weird about that heliport

72
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,430
I see right there so heliport we just

73
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,930
notify them so it literally takes a

74
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,250
phone call we'll be operating a drone

75
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,990
under five pound we were to give that

76
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:37,700
exactly where to do that so it's simple

77
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,229
I mean it's not for a commercial purpose

78
00:04:39,229 --> 00:04:41,510
religious out testing your new toy that

79
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,410
we've bought

80
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:44,330
so we are we're following the rules

81
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:46,610
which involves a boat but we're still

82
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:47,480
following the rules

83
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,540

92
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:59,500
tools at my disposal and I only ever fly

93
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,290
small consumer drones but I have been

94
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:03,760
wanting to upgrade to something more

95
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,770
professional-looking

96
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:07,630

Liberty okay yeah I'm about to have my

107

00:07:35,719 --> 00:07:38,179
yeah it looked at we're really close we

119
00:07:38,179 --> 00:07:39,649
can't fly over the island because this

120
00:07:39,649 --> 00:07:41,539
is National Park so because it's a

121
00:07:41,539 --> 00:07:43,309
national park we can't fly over the

122
00:07:43,309 --> 00:07:44,779
Statue of Liberty but we have a really

123
00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:46,579
long lens like what would look like a

124
00:07:46,579 --> 00:07:49,519
long zoom lens on the camera so it looks

125
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:50,899
like we're really close to the Statue of

126
00:07:50,899 --> 00:07:53,269
Liberty but really for hundreds of feet

127
00:07:53,269 --> 00:08:02,719
away from it so that was it that was my

128
00:08:02,719 --> 00:08:05,779
first time operating camera how to do I

129
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:08,539

131
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:17,389
exciting see I don't get this
