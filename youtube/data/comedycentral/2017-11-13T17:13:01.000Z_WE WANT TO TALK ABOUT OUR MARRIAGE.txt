Kenneth and I are headed to our therapy

3
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,710
our couples therapy session right now

4
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,640
and I had an idea that I wanted to talk

5
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,330
to you about and get your opinion on

6
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:32,130
we're thinking about doing a podcast a

7
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,770
Casey and Candice podcast that's like I

8
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:35,910
don't know like an hour long or a half

9
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,489
an hour long or something and calling it

10
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:41,040
the title of the best part calling it

11
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,410
therapy where it's just us talking there

12
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,090
probably is but we can just make ours

13
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,710
bigger and better and then crush the

14
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:54,899
competition so let us know you think

15
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:57,030
like that's a terrible idea just write

16
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,770
terrible idea below if you'd be

17
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,980
interested at all well the only thing is

18
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,480
I'm tired of hearing the comments that

19
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,479
I'm such a like bitching a dud I think

20
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,590
people

21
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:25,009
[Music]

22
00:01:25,009 --> 00:01:28,069
we're at therapy now but that's the idea

23
00:01:28,069 --> 00:01:39,159
let us let us know what you think

24
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:40,930
we finished therapy how do you think

25
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:47,500
today went today in therapy we talked

26
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,940
about having more children

27
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:50,890
and whether or not we want to move to

28
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:59,530
California

29
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:04,069
we should do the podcast

30

like that I think you should follow that

64
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:44,380
I think maybe you'll be interested in

65
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,360
and the video that I made is about my

66
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,490
friend Chantal who you've seen in this

67
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:51,480

00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,780
movie on my channel even though it's

70
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:58,540
gonna live on her channel I want to use

71
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,250
in this channel and I want to use like

72
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,260
this big audience that that this channel

73
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:05,500
has to talk about smaller creators she's

74
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,550
brand new she doesn't have any

75
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,500
subscribers and to talk about other

76
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,390
people that I think are doing amazing

77
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:13,120
things in this platform and try to sort

78
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,410
of elevate them a little bit shine a

79
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:30,280
little spotlight on them so this is uh

80
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,040
this is my friend Chantal Chantal is a

81
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,400
fine artist do you go by that visual

82
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,600
this all this find all this and the

83
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,820
reason why I like Chantal so much as an

84
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,170
art the reason why I like her as a

85
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:45,430
person that's cuz she's cool the reason

86
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,750
why I like her as an artist is because

87
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,420
her only instrument her only actually

88
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:53,500
have her entire art career was built

89
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:57,610
with a pan just a pen look this is this

90
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:58,900
is my apartment

91
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,690
and then this is I have one of chantels

92
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:04,270
paintings in my apartment that's

93
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,640
Francine in my apartment a couple years

94
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,440
ago had a studio here but we were

95
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,020
friends before that yeah she had one of

96
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,100
the best studios she had one of the

97
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,060
studios in this feeling that has

98
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,340
skylight you almost took it I was gonna

99
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,780
take it it's just like four flights away

100
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:17,740
I don't want to go up all those stairs

101
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,130
I've always wanted to make a movie about

102
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:23,140
Chantal and her artwork and who she is

103
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,610
because she's such an interesting human

104
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:27,190
being and we were kind of given the

105
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,760
excuse actually from Sam

106
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,650
are you gonna stick with that - oh yeah

107
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:34,170
this is one of Chantell stickers we were

108
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,760
given the opportunity because of Samsung

109
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,200
you know part of their like creator

110
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,240
creator initiative is enabling us to

111
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,490
make movies and they were willing to

112
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:44,040
sort of produce a case you nice that

113
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,320
movie about Chantal Martin and I'm gonna

114
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,030
premiere that movie I'm wondering where

115
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:50,220
I should drop it let me finish

116
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,470
let's finish okay let's finish an and

117
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:55,110
it'll play cool I'm reviving my old

118
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:56,730
youtube channel that I started probably

119
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:59,220
10 11 12 years ago right at the

120
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,590
beginning and I forgot I had it actually

121
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:03,510
one thing that I will say about Chantal

122
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:07,380
is she is fearless about trying new

123
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,880
things it's like I see everything is a

124
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,710
blank canvas so you shouldn't be afraid

125
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:12,510
of it you should flip that switch and

126
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,220
then just use it as a challenge and

127
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,080
create whatever you want how did you

128
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,540
meet Kendrick Lamar still in Miami last

129
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,870
year how did you meet Puff Daddy he came

130
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:27,570
to the show I had a few years ago he

131
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:30,030
probably doesn't remember okay so

132
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:33,000
without further ado I'm good this is the

133
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,780
world YouTube premiere of a Chantel by

134
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,810
KC video it's like three minutes long

135
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:41,250
but I'm really excited you're the first

136
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:56,539
people to see this ever ready 3 2 1

137
00:06:56,539 --> 00:07:00,629
so what's the point in making our the

138
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:03,360
point is to make so you can share so you

139
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,979
may concern your making sure you make

140
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:06,529
your share

141
00:07:06,529 --> 00:07:10,110
I'm Chantal Martin and I draw I'm

142
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,909
drawing on canvases I'm drawing on walls

143
00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:13,649
I'm going on cars and drawing on shirts

144
00:07:13,649 --> 00:07:17,550
and drawing on shoes 99% of that is done

145
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,889
live when you're drawing live you have

146
00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:21,779
no time to think you have no time to

147
00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:24,959
hesitate you have no time to plan you

148
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:35,099
have no time to be anyone else so this

149
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:38,669
is the cover of the home and garden

150
00:07:38,669 --> 00:07:41,249
section and it's it's funny I didn't

151
00:07:41,249 --> 00:07:42,749
know it was a big deal at the time so I

152
00:07:42,749 --> 00:07:45,119
only bought one copy so you have an

153
00:07:45,119 --> 00:07:51,289
extra spare copy out there I take it I

154
00:07:51,289 --> 00:07:53,399
remember my art teacher telling me

155
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:55,409
Chantal don't apply for art school

156
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:56,849
because you're not good enough and you

157
00:07:56,849 --> 00:07:59,879
won't get in at that point people were

158
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,469
only telling me what I couldn't do

159
00:08:01,469 --> 00:08:04,460
so I ran away

160
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:09,139
I started my career in Japan in a

161
00:08:09,139 --> 00:08:11,090
culture that was craft based in a

162
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,069
culture where people learn things and

163
00:08:13,069 --> 00:08:15,590
practice things over generations over

164
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:17,840
long periods of time and I remember

165
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,270
thinking to myself what can I master in

166
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,080
my lifetime

167
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,389
what could I become a family confident

168
00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:25,400
with what about a lie you know I draw I

169
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,560
love drawing we all drop though with

170
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:32,229
these these I'm gonna draw like this

171
00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:35,029
what kind of hard work and patience

172
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:37,550
would it take so that when I draw a line

173
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:42,229
is recognizably mine moving to york was

174
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:44,510
very humbling because if no one knows

175
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:46,160
who you are they don't care who you are

176
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,000
and everyone is an artist and you start

177
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,020
to lose your

178
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:54,170
you start to lose your way and so I

179
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:56,330
decided well I'm not gonna not make up

180
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:58,190
because you won't show it I'm gonna draw

181
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:00,050
maybe the well my canvas and I'm gonna

182
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:01,790
lose any drawing tool that I can get my

183
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:08,470
hand I'm gonna draw and villager on

184
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:10,459
just give me a pen and I'll make

185
00:09:10,459 --> 00:09:14,720
something

186
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,739
[Applause]

187
00:09:18,739 --> 00:09:21,269
we follow the pen and we're allowed to

188
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:23,999
allow it to go wherever it needs to go

189
00:09:23,999 --> 00:09:27,089
wherever it wants to take you you are a

192
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,520
and now you repeat that and you repeat

193
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,050
that and you repeat that you repeat that

194
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:38,060
but over time you get to extract what

195
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,950
you look like over time you get to

196
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,510
extract what your line feels like

197
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:46,010
something that is recognizably yours we

198
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:47,810
have this contact between our head and

199
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:49,730
our pan it doesn't matter what industry

200
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:52,070
you're in it comes down to drawing it

201
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:54,170
comes down to that initial mark that you

202
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:56,660
make and without this pen I wouldn't

203
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,890
have traveled I wouldn't have

204
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:01,550
collaborated this tool has allowed me to

205
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:04,230
discover who I am
