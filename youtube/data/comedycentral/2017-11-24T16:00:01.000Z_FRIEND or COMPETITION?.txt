plenty of space doing fine I know the

25
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,610
face you're giving the camera Peter you

26
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,320

27
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:36,979
cinematographer than you are

28
00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:39,509

00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,099
don't know

35
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:13,079

36
00:02:13,079 --> 00:02:15,209
the tower behind us they're great let me

37
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:17,220
just cheat yourself I got a little close

38
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,590
with this thing's all wobbly so largely

39
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,700
because we only have a short amount of

40
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,890
time but also because Peters such an

41
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,780
aficionado when it comes to

42
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,269
cinematography and camera gear and and

43
00:02:27,269 --> 00:02:29,040
all those things I thought it might be

44
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:35,069
an appropriate Q&amp;A ready I'm ready

45
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:37,799
Butch Hartman question we want to do a

46
00:02:37,799 --> 00:02:39,870
collab with me yes I do but Hartman

47
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,130
that's the guy that drew Fairly

48
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:42,299
OddParents you know this guy

49
00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:43,390
I know this guy

50
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:45,989
[Music]

51
00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:49,209
right yeah we're gonna do a hundo peak

52
00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:51,159
lab what are mistakes you see people

53
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:54,010
making with storytelling I think a

54
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:55,510
misconception of storytelling is that

55
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:57,159
you need like a hero and a villain and

56
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:59,110
it has to be like a classical like you

57
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:01,120
know a plot whereas a story can just be

58
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,010
something very basic from moving from

59
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:04,360
point A to point B doesn't to be so

60
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,310
literal that's right that's right it's

61
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,620
my thinking that best Airport you've

62
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:12,910
been to probably Hong Kong or I like to

63
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:15,909
Amsterdam oh oh no no Doha it has a

64
00:03:15,909 --> 00:03:18,710
swimming pool in it oh hands-down winner

65
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,849
[Music]

66
00:03:20,849 --> 00:03:24,040
so Dan asks when shooting a vlog are all

67
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,840
of your shots done in sequence or do you

68
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,400
film a talking ahead segment then go

69
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,140
back and b-roll and my answer to that is

70
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,060
I don't always shoot in sequence no in

71
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,010
fact the video that I made yesterday of

72
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:35,200
us in the Amsterdam so the anchor that

73
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,049
videos me interviewing you we shot that

74
00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:39,790
the next day and then I used that as

75
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:42,609
like a narrative bed for the rest of the

76
00:03:42,609 --> 00:03:44,560
episode yeah there's tons of times where

77
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,480
I actually film a vlog over like three

78
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,340
days time and I wear the same clothes

79
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,989
and then just cut it in to make it feel

80
00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:51,849
like it was all done the same day Rick

81
00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:53,709
wants to know when do you guys get

82
00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:55,690
married we're not I think they're

83
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:57,190
getting the wrong I don't understand

84
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:59,049
that we like to collaborate in the

85
00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:02,049
videos we've made one video interesting

86
00:04:02,049 --> 00:04:03,430
how do you feel the people looking at

87
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:04,989
you as a crazy person when you're

88
00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:06,430
talking into a camera I find it very

89
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:08,500
hard if you're worried that much about

90
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,720
what people think of you you probably

91
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,940
should not try to be a youtuber I mean

92
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,530
there's always something a little weird

93
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,329
about it oh it's weird

94
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:18,669
you just gotta oh yeah oh yeah try

95
00:04:18,669 --> 00:04:19,959
vlogging with a GoPro on your head

96
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,639
that's the most weird it's ever been for

97
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:23,860
me what color profile do you use Casey

98
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:27,250
no answer I have no idea yeah okay

99
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:30,160
I shoot flat so if I had a log color

100
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,570
profile on my cameras I would use that

101
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:33,250
but I shoot everything flat so that it

102
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:36,610
color grades better in post

103
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,580
he's good when you sit down out of the

104
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,229
vlog do you have an entire idea of how

105
00:04:41,229 --> 00:04:43,240
you want the entire thing to play out or

106
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,530
do you dive in headfirst and see what

107
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:47,409
you can create I almost always know

108
00:04:47,409 --> 00:04:49,270
before I start to edit what I'm doing

109
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:51,039
but I assemble it and I really tighten

110
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:53,110
up the story in the Edit I need to be

111
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:55,210
better at that because I a lot of the

112
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:56,650
time just like fly by the seat of my

113
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:58,150
pants I'm starting to edit and I'm like

114
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:59,889
oh I like where this is going and then I

115
00:04:59,889 --> 00:05:01,930
have some ideas but that is not my

116
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:03,310
preferred method of creating I would

117
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:05,169
much rather have it planned we gotta go

118
00:05:05,169 --> 00:05:07,120
let's go we gotta go this is the Q&amp;A is

119
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:15,490
not over we got to go to the whose

120
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:18,610

121
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:23,259
Melissa I don't think Jim listen

122
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:24,759
Alejandra thank you for letting us use

123
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:34,560
your apartment it was a great

124
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,440
[Music]

125
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,480
you got this all right right back right

126
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,520
right back keep it straight you got it

127
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,500
straight you're good

128
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,160
plenty of distance 75 feet six suck it

129
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,320
up funny his face cut the wheel

130
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,510
straighten her out cut the wheel the

131
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,770
other way straighten her out

132
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,050
turn the wheel you know that scene and

133
00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:14,410
Austin Powers as a youtuber how do you

134
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,090
create original content when it seems

135
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:18,480
like everything has already been done

136
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,980
yeah I'll hit that one off you have to

137
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:24,850
tell your story if I've told all of my

138
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,560
stories and piers told all of his

139
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,660
stories which neither of us have it

140
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,340
doesn't change the fact that nobody

141
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:33,010
knows your story so the written language

142
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:34,660
has been around since hieroglyphics

143
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:35,920
thousands of years there are still new

144
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,410
stories being told every single day not

145
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:40,330
everything's been done it's up to you to

146
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:43,930
find your own voice on YouTube and

147
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:46,600
nobody can do that better than you that

148
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,890
was good that was like I was I feel like

149
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:49,270
I was being kind of aggressive there and

150
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,350
then you were kind of like the super

151
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:52,950
nice just want to bring it home you know

152
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:55,300
I'm headed back to my event now great

153
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,040
question here do you see Peter as a

154
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:01,420
competitor or as a friend no as a friend

155
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,520
but I said anything about all youtubers

156
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,280
anyone who works in the space is big as

157
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,710
YouTube and thinks that somebody else's

158
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:10,980
success is gonna slow them down is

159
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:14,020
sorely mistaken YouTube is not at all a

160
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:17,260
zero-sum game it is the more people who

161
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,930
can succeed on this platform the more we

162
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:22,200
will all succeed on this platform like

163
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,340
simply put the Internet is big enough

164
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:27,250
for everyone yeah are you coming to the

165
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,590
