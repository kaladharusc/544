47
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:56,599
handle on Instagram I think we got the

48
00:02:56,599 --> 00:03:00,080
same handle on Instagram so now both the

49
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,110
Instagram and Twitter handle 4 3 6 8 is

50
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:06,910
simply at 3 6 8 that is called nepotism

51
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:10,340

62
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,459
my friend Griffin Harrington shot that

63
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:50,430
this morning on the subway Griffin nice

64
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,670
catch but that is that is really how wet

65
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:56,640
it is in New York City today a couple

66
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,040
days ago on Twitter I saw this video

67
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,230
that was kind of going viral and it was

68
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:03,510
this kind of like big mafioso looking

69
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,870
dude sitting on like a public

70
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:09,060
transportation train and he was just

71
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,099
shaving matter-of-factly he had shaving

72
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:13,650
cream on he was shaving and the people

73
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:15,689
film me or sort of snickering and making

74
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:25,490
a joke of it and it was it was

75
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:27,440
and I remember my finger went straight

76
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,509
the retweet button and I hovered over it

77
00:04:29,509 --> 00:04:31,400
I thought it'd be funny to share it's a

78
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,039
very New York City moment but I didn't

79
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:35,690
click the button and I thought for a

80
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:37,370
second look maybe there's more to this

81
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:40,639
story i whatever and then I scrolled on

82
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,620
and I went on with my life so then this

83
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,870
morning I see this news story that's

84
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:47,599
trending and the title of the of the

85
00:04:47,599 --> 00:04:50,150
news story is man can't save II on train

86
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:54,229
and viral video says don't judge so let

87
00:04:54,229 --> 00:04:55,669
me just I'm just gonna read a little bit

88
00:04:55,669 --> 00:04:58,669
a man was mocked online after he was

89
00:04:58,669 --> 00:05:00,500
recorded shaving at his seat on a

90
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,210
commuter train heading out of New York

91
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:04,070
City said he was just trying to clean up

92
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:07,180
after days spent in a homeless shelter

93
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,979
the story goes on it says the truth

94
00:05:09,979 --> 00:05:12,139
Torres says is that the video captured

95
00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:14,120
him at a vulnerable moment he had been

96
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,740
homeless staying at a shelter in New

97
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,630
York City he reached out to his family

98
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:18,500
for help

99
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,240
a brother gave him money for a train

100
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,580
ticket and then this is the part that

101
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,580
really hit me hard he goes he left a

102
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,259
shelter before having a chance to shower

103
00:05:27,259 --> 00:05:28,729
and clean up and he wanted to look

104
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:31,220
presentable so the nut of the story is

105
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,720
just that this guy has a really hard

106
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,210
life he's trying to get some help he

107
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,710
didn't want to look like a schlub so he

108
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,630
shaved and he was ridiculed for it and

109
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,550
the story ends by saying a quote from

110
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,800
his brother maybe people will have more

111
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,990
feeling knowing what this kid's been

112
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:48,320
through so the moral of the story for me

113
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,460
is never judge generally like everybody

114
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,900
has their own demons that they're

115
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,460
dealing with their own struggles that

116
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:59,090
they're dealing with so before before I

117
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:02,599
judge I I want to make a more concerted

118
00:06:02,599 --> 00:06:05,120
effort to really try to empathize with

119
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,820
others and that's what that that's that

120
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,460
story just kind of

121
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:30,380
made me think of how's it going how many

122
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:36,500
captains today five five yeah I'm Casey

123
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,110
yeah Justin is this the most popular one

124
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:42,380
so far it is Justin let me see okay and

125
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:44,510
of all of Jeremy's great designs what

126
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,430
about that one you like the most I think

127
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,830
it's more most actionable probably it's

128
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:51,380
a good reminder I think to keep it in

129
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:57,020
top of mine all the times Jeremy I was

130
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,520
gonna give the your tattoo operation a

131
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:05,030
plug anything I should say are all the

132
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:09,680
slots gone I found a link below the

133
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,830
Jeremy 368 tattoo project is up and

134
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,930
running new designs every day and a

135
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:16,550
couple of slots there's some left this

136
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:40,819
week okay all right later

137
00:07:40,819 --> 00:07:43,889
eight skateboarding in the rain search

138
00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:45,479
after Dan got hurt standing in the rain

139
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:48,479
at me Oh Dan I gotta talk to you about

140
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:55,600
Dan

141
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,690
dad was only here temporarily you know

142
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:01,450
from the start but we weren't sure when

143
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:04,780
like that temporariness we weren't sure

144
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,160
how long the whole thing was gonna last

145
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,520
and okay so I guess he was in Northern

146
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,120
Ireland for like a video conference or

147
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,060
something and instead of coming back to

148
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,590
New York he had to go back to South

149
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:21,580
Africa and he told me from South Africa

150
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,270
he's like hey bro

151
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:24,550
I heard you like the South Africa none

152
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:26,020
of it made any sense there's something

153
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,090
you had to deal with there apparently so

154
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:31,090
I danced back in Cape Town not

155
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:33,970
permanently but for now and it's really

156
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:36,400
sad because he's like three 6/8

157
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,320
cheerleader and mascot and he's just

158
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:45,290
drawn don't forget us stand
