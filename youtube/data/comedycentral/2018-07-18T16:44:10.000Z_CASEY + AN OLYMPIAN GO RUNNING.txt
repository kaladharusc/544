36
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,570
we run

37
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:03,970
we need the questions we're just gonna

38
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:05,530
we're gonna do the questions here I

39
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:07,480
think this was a good one too definitely

40
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,640
what is your advice for absolute

41
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,770
beginners absolute beginners I'm gonna

42
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:13,840
go first I'm gonna first here's my

43
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,550
advice of Eunice's how I started running

44
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:18,010
if you've never run before focus on time

45
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:20,740
and time alone so set yourself a goal

46
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,570
like can you run for two full minutes

47
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:25,840
two minutes without stopping if you can

48
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,420
do to get to four once you get to ten

49
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,640
minutes without stopping get to 20 until

50
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,670
you hit an hour that took me like four

51
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,740
months and I started running good advice

52
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:36,430
spot-on

53
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,380
just gradual start everybody starts a

54
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,180
different place but something where to

55
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:42,910
build up from yeah what are the best

56
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:50,780
shoes what are you running

57
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:54,350
I exclusively run a New Balance that

58
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:56,480
being said there's the shoe out there

59
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,780
for everybody no two feet are the same

60
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,060
I run almost exclusively in Brooks I'm

61
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,010
in Nikes today Asics are good New

62
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:05,600
Balance are good and Mizuno's good

63
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,430
they're all good it's just what works

64
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,230
for you because every foot every foots

65
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:16,910
different lucas asks okay Lucas asks how

66
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:18,280
do I stop running away from my problems

67
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,020
I'm only answering that joke question

68
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:24,980
because I I literally run to get away

69
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,870
from my problems like what I'm having a

70
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:29,450
tough time running makes me happy I'm

71
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:31,820
having problems at work whatever having

72
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,980
fights with Candice but I'm just getting

73
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:34,550
angry

74
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:37,340
a run does cheer me up I literally run

75
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,470
away from my problem that's why I run 70

76
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,300
miles a week that's a great question

77
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:49,109
[Music]

78
00:03:49,109 --> 00:03:50,849
Maron asked what is the difference

79
00:03:50,849 --> 00:03:53,730
between running on trails and roads and

80
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:55,230
running on a treadmill and which is

81
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:58,109
better I see no reason to run inside

82
00:03:58,109 --> 00:03:59,879
almost ever

83
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:02,159
trail running and running on concrete I

84
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,560
personally love trail running I just

85
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,389
love getting outside get with my

86
00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:09,480
thoughts feel nature and what's the

87
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,790
difference like is it better for you um

88
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,950
yeah I say running on trail softer

89
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:15,989
surfaces it's easier on the joints so a

90
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:17,459
lot of people aren't aware that I'm

91
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:19,380
running on concrete all the time it

92
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,849
tends to beat you up a little bit even

93
00:04:20,849 --> 00:04:22,169
if you have proper footwear that's why

94
00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:24,330
I'm hurt every year well he also runs a

95
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:33,270
lot do you stop for water a lot Jeremy

96
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:35,550
wants to know do you warm up or just go

97
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,800
for it you warm up no I just gradually

98
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,320
build into it I never warm up if it's a

99
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,750
short race like a 5k I'll warm up but

100
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,370
for my training runs like every day I

101
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:47,160
never warm up I just go outside thank

102
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,280
you maximum distance covered in one run

103
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,860
I think the most for me if I see the 32

104
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,979
or 34 miles whatever you get lost

105
00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:59,729
no I just love distance all right for me

106
00:04:59,729 --> 00:05:02,970
I ran 29 miles once by accident

107
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:06,120
I actually got left behind so I had to

108
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,090
get home

109
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:17,470

[Music]

112
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,000
there's one from gand I think it

113
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,410
probably a lot of people struggle with

114
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:43,240
but how do you get out there on days

115
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,390
when you're not feeling motivated good

116
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:48,490
question remember - what got you want

117
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:49,900
there in the first place what your goals

118
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,250
are there's gonna be good days and bad

119
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,750
days motivation for me is just like

120
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,910
running makes me so happy if I don't run

121
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:01,870
a miserable and that's kind of that's

122
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:05,950
kind of all I need okay ash Ashley wants

123
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:08,200
to know I used to run a lot and I've

124
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,180
fallen out of it any tips for getting

125
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:13,180
back into running can't stop one stop a

126
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,580
break here and there it's okay but

127
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,590
you're gonna make the biggest gains by

128
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:19,330
being consistent in your training so

129
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:22,000
again just try to get out there neither

130
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,800
avoid it neither of us had an answer for

131
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,480
that question I'm not seeing this

132
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,950
question here but I want to know from

133
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:29,410
you mm-hmm for my own well-being do you

134
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:31,480
stretch if I'm gonna stretch it's gonna

135
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,460
be after the run when your muscles are

136
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,260
more warmed up before nope definitely

137
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,750
not before unless he do a slight warmup

138
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,510
run so never stretch cold don't stretch

139
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:43,750
cold can lead to injury goodbye all

140
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,419
right last last question I don't think

141
00:06:46,419 --> 00:06:49,290
anybody asked it but I'm gonna ask it

142
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:53,770
why do you run Roberto great question I

143
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:57,010
like I personally run because is my

144
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:58,870
journey of self-discovery I want to find

145
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,760
out just how good can I be hit what are

146
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,680
my limitations and running is so pure

147
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,890
there's no red there's no coach you know

148
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:08,080
so pure yeah you just go out there and

149
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,450
you run and you just find out how good

150
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:22,300
can I be that's why I run

151
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:35,790
sweetie

152
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:40,330
[Music]

153
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:43,220
all right so that that concludes kind of

154
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,470
our first aren't your leg was touching

155
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:47,900
my leg that's alright we'll roll with it

156
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,610
it's just weird when it's like two grown

157
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:52,100
men it's a lot of leg action it's a

158
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:55,130
running movie that's our first running

159
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:57,920
movie I can foresee a lot of people

160
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,560
saying but what but I want to know a lot

161
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,930
of unanswered questions but Roberto

162
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:04,160
keeps saying like this should be a

163
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,040
series and I think he's right so I hope

164
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,200
this was helpful yeah we look forward to

165
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,030
