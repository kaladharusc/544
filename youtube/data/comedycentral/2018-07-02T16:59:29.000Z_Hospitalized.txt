00:00:08,929 --> 00:00:12,300
I've had this stomach ache that has been

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,650
like ah

4
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:17,550
fierce like crippling the old man thinks

5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,880
it could be an appendicitis like where

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,250
they have to cut out your appendix good

7
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:28,349
job do I hope it's not bad yeah I'm not

8
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:34,020
looking forward to this at all well

9
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,430
Stanley what should we do

10
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,450
George going to hospital that we have to

11
00:00:39,450 --> 00:01:16,080
go now yes well I'm outside the hospital

12
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,890
now out of triage is that 45-minute wait

13
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:22,189
before they give me a proper inspection

14
00:01:22,189 --> 00:01:25,170
you know I don't feel sick I don't feel

15
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:26,340
like there's anything wrong with me but

16
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,130
Candace's dad is like an expert doctor

17
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,570
so if he says I need to cover the

18
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:43,590
hospital so I have a really severe pain

19
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:53,820
right here okay

20
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,940
[Music]

21
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:59,670
all right she's worried about my

22
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,300
appendix but wants to make sure it's not

23
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:03,900
like that

24
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:13,380
some sort of infection okay yeah I think

25
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:16,880
that's my bed you seem fine to me

26
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,190
your dad said it's a 70% chance that

27
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:25,790
it's a problem yeah

28
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:34,440
I've got huge veins yeah you do I hate

29
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,530
that feeling

30
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:39,330
man that's like getting a needle shoved

31
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:42,060
under your skin and into your arm that's

32
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,670
what it feels like but seriously how do

33
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:45,680
you think I'm doing

34
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,780
you're such a baby I felt bad for you

35
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,160
when you're in pain last night I don't

36
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,870
feel bad for when you complain about my

37
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:58,850
new tattoo

38

[Music]

40
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,530
so the CT scans done now I don't know we

41
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:29,610
just I think now they just like look to

42
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,200
see what's happening inside of my body

43
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,480
to make the determination as to whether

44
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,920
or not it actually is like an

45
00:03:34,920 --> 00:04:02,280
appendicitis or something else so in any

46
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,160
event it is now 1:00 in the morning

47
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,080
Candice and her father left at like

48
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,540
10:30 they moved me from the emergency

49
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,820
room up into this private room which is

50
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:12,480
lovely

51
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,250
it's very nice up here I've got a

52
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:17,850
television and a window and now it's

53
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:21,690
just the waiting game so I think I just

54
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,670
like sleep or do whatever you do in a

55
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:27,180
hospital until 8:00 a.m. okay I'll see

56
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:37,410
you then all right nothing I did I just

57
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:42,480
get to come home they said they said I'm

58
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:48,510
a prime candidate for no operation 7:00

59
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,210
in the morning

60
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:53,460
703 in the morning I slept like a baby

61
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,200
last night I make him sleep anywhere I

62
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,210
slept particularly well in this hospital

63
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:57,990
last night

64
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:00,000
so before I went to bed they put me on

65
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,590
antibiotics that's what this whole

66
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:03,180
business and this whole business is

67
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:06,060
about and they said the antibiotics

68
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:09,810
might actually fix the problem this

69
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,610
morning the residents the doctors here

70
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:13,890
they said if I'd woken up and like was

71
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:15,480
in much more pain than I was in last

72
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,660
night that then I should get the surgery

73
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,950
but because I don't have more pain than

74
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:23,210
I had last night that I'm probably good

75
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:26,910
which is like tremendous news so right

76
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,020
now I'm just kind of chilling and I'm

77
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,419
waiting for the attending physician to

78
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:31,169
come

79
00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:36,060
give me his opinion but yeah I think I

80
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,169
just got a night in the hospital I got

81
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:39,560
some great antibiotics no surgery and

82
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,669
that's where I'm at right now

83
00:05:43,669 --> 00:05:49,370
Thank You doctors

84
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:52,889
