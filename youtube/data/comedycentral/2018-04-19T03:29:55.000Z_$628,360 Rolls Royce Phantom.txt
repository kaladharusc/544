36
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:38,290
comprehensive this this carpet here

37
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:41,110
it's lamb's wool or sheepskin or

38
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:49,660
something see this what's the thing on

39
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:54,630

40
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:58,140
and lifts your feet up on us so on the

41
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,430
floor here you've got a footrest

42
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:08,000
elevator simply punch this part here and

43
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,370
there is a massage feature back here mmm

44
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:15,840
it kind of rolls up and down your back

45
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,440
it starts real low this pillows just

46
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,430
incredibly soft

47
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:24,660
it's plushness is almost intimate look

48
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:27,210
at that and then here in the back of the

49
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:29,520
front seat is the multimedia system I

50
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,040
think you push this button there you get

51
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:37,230
it to open

52
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:41,390
[Music]

53
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:43,920
so this is the multimedia system here

54
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,830
you control it with the controller that

55
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:51,570
lives under here and then when you put

56
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:53,280
away the monitor when you put away the

57
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,900
monitor you're left with like an

58
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,860
airplane tray to put your snacks and

59
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,930
[Music]

60
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:04,290
champagne on now I'm sure there are more

61
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,300
features back here but I want to go up

62
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,800
front and have a look at the driver's

63
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:23,550
seat this is what it's like in the

64
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:25,290
cockpit now either the guy who drives

65
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:28,050
this car is really tall or I've got the

66
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,600
seat I feel tiny back here I feel like

67
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,640
my grandmother when she used to drive

68
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,140
like I can barely see over the steering

69
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,970
this cars got cameras all around it I

70
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:40,110
don't know what all of them are for but

71
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,550
it's really interesting yeah what you

72
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:43,380
can like here there's another camera

73
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:46,180
right there where's the camera there

74
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,190
there and then that's a camera there

75
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:50,229
look at this one camera in the front of

76
00:04:50,229 --> 00:04:51,970
the car I don't know how it works this

77
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:53,650
is the front of the car and you can

78
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:55,960
actually see what's behind the car I

79
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,000
don't know how it does that and this is

80
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,830
the car as if there's a drone above the

81
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:02,590
car looking down on it you see this

82
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:04,449
button right here the one full moon on

83
00:05:04,449 --> 00:05:08,259
it this button that turns on an infrared

84
00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:10,389
camera have a look that's stand right

85
00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:15,039
there and that's Dan in infrared dan in

86
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,280
real life and Dan an infrared the

87
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,169
control panel here these are all LCD

88
00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:23,770
screens and this is like a glass this is

89
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:25,720
like glass and all of these displays in

90
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,620
the clocks of the air behind this glass

91
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,190
[Music]

92
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:31,449
so my conclusive review of the

93
00:05:31,449 --> 00:05:34,060
rolls-royce eighth-generation phantom is

94
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:38,740
uh well it's a fine fine vehicle for six

95
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,690
hundred and forty thousand dollars I'm

96
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:43,080
