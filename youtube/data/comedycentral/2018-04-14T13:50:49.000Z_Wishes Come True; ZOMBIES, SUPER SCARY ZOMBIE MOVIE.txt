one of those kids and for his wish he

22
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,890
wanted to come to New York City and part

23
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:06,630

this is Nick hey Nick welcome to the

27
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,180
studio tell us about how and why you

28
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:28,840
were sick um well I was diagnosed with a

29
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,549
liver problem called biliary atresia

30
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:33,880
when I was around two weeks old it gives

31
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,530
you a lot of stomachaches I waited for

32
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:36,939
about thirteen years for a transplant

33
00:01:36,939 --> 00:01:40,539
and so I went for those thirteen years

34
00:01:40,539 --> 00:01:42,759
through some pretty tough hard times

35
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:45,490
dealing with that which really sucked

36
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:47,320
how old were you when you had when you

37
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,640
got a new liver

38

2012 was the day you want to be a

40
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,580
filmmaker I had an idea which is we

41
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:00,069
should try to make a narrative movie and

42
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:02,259
we can premiere the narrative movie on

43
00:02:02,259 --> 00:02:06,009
