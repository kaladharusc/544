we're very very proud parents this

18
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:05,070
morning so I have a bit of a problem

19
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:07,550
here with my my bike which is that I

20
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:09,720
travel with the charger to keep this

21
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,090
thing full but I ain't got nowhere to

22
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:12,630
put it

23
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:15,509
also I keep a lock with me and I know

24
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:16,920
we're gonna put that either so that's

25
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,840
also in the backpack those are two

26
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,650
problems I'm looking to rectify today

27
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:31,549
[Music]

28
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:36,090
hey doing locks I'm looking for a lock I

29
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:38,100
want a lock that attaches to my bike in

30
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,560
a way that's like seamless I mean this

31
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,790
one does like a velcro strap

32
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:44,070
unlike the down tube only more secure

33
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,880
than velcro

34
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:56,220
[Music]

35
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:59,360
sometimes it's

36
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,190
okay so I don't know how to attach it

37
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:02,840
yet but I think I got the right lock to

38
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,910
attempt to attach why are there palm

39
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:11,659
trees in New York City

40
00:02:11,659 --> 00:02:14,510
must be some sort of some sort of party

41
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:25,140
happening in there

42
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,330
you hear out loud this is this is the

43
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:37,630
block

44
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,970
dear

45
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:41,550
[Music]

46
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:44,890
funny story well not such a funny story

47
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:49,300
but true story right right when Candace

48
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,580
and I got married we got our dream

49
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,380
apartment which was which was this

50
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:55,270
awesome loft right across the street

51
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:57,250
from the studio in fact if you watch the

52
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,750
early episodes of the vlogs you'll see

53
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,150
me like skateboard and hoverboard

54
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,310
remember those things hoverboard from my

55
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,710
apartment to this office and the reason

56
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:08,340
why we moved is because 24 hours a day

57
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,900
seven days a week with some version of

58
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:15,790
that noise

59
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:32,530
it never ever stops

60
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:34,970
never underestimate the versatility of

61
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:38,410
zip ties so what I'm thinking here is

62
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:42,260
attach the charger right there under the

63
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,600
seat run the cable up leave it

64
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,370
permanently plugged in and then have the

65
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:49,100
DAC plug just sort of kind of hanging

66
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:53,920
loose and I'll wrap it around the frame

67
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,300
first zip tie already feels good and

68
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:06,410
secure all right now I'm gonna run this

69
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:09,410
cable huh into the charging port there

70
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:11,810
and then I need to tighten up this cable

71
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:12,860
which I will do with these

72
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,880
lighter-weight zip ties

73
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:23,060
[Music]

74
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,920
last sanity to solve for here's what to

75
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,500
do with this cable maybe just wrap it

76
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,550
around here

77
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:32,190
it doesn't look pretty but that's not

78
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:35,640
the point okay now when I need to charge

79
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,160
my bike I can just plug it in and I no

80
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:45,960
longer have to carry the charger hey

81
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,520
that's a nice bird thank you

82
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,530
