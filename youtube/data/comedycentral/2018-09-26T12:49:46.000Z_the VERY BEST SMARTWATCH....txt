1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,589
you could hit this thing with a hammer

2
00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:03,400
and not break it

3
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:13,520

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:21,050
[Applause]

5
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:30,450
ready ah today's episode of tech review

6
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:32,730
Tuesday we're gonna be asking one simple

7
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:35,880
question which is which SmartWatch is

8
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,160
the best SmartWatch

9
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:56,640
[Music]

10
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,750
and I do want to apologize for not

11
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,699
having this week's tech review Tuesday

12
00:01:00,699 --> 00:01:03,370
intro complete dan who does the intros

13
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:05,710
out of town will get to next week before

14
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:07,240
I get into the specifics of each watch

15
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:25,899
let me a little context so that is the

16
00:01:25,899 --> 00:01:27,970
SmartWatch spectrum on one end to be

17
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:31,030
extreme is simply a watch this just

18
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:32,770
tells the time doesn't know anything

19
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:35,080
else they tell me the date just the time

20
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,080
on the other end is a fully-fledged

21
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,300
wrist computer and then the middle you

22
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,369
have like a fitness sports focused watch

23
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:44,170
and then what I think is probably the

24
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:48,920
the best competitor to the Apple watch

25
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,539
[Music]

26
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:56,530
that's the spectrum now before I get

27
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:58,960
into the intimacy's of each device

28
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,329
there's another major factor to keep in

29
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:04,420
mind as context when considering a

30
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,880
SmartWatch and that is how much of a

31
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,950
pain in the ass are they for what they

32
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:17,079
give you in return and there is a very

33
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:20,739
literal inversely proportional rationale

34
00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:23,890
to how much a SmartWatch can do versus

35
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:26,320
how much you have to well how big of a

36
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:30,420
how much of a pain in the ass it is

37
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:42,349
[Music]

38
00:02:42,349 --> 00:02:46,319
so here is how the SmartWatch analysis

39
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,390
will be taking place I'll be testing the

40
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:51,690
watches build quality ecosystem

41
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:54,300
capability and battery and this will

42
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,550
include a regular watch watch the Garmin

43
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:00,360
Phoenix five plus the Apple watch 444

44
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,519
millimeter and the big size galaxy watch

45
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:07,470
now really the reason why I included a

46
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,360
regular watch in this is because it's

47
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,310
just sort of axes of control

48
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:14,130
bibble quality first up on build is the

49
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:16,890
Phoenix five plus the build quality is

50
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:18,750
excellent on this thing it does have a

51
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:22,380
crystal face like the Apple watch beyond

52
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,269
that all the way around this is it's all

53
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:27,180
stainless steel this is this is my old

54
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,390
old one you see it's a little bit T it's

55
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:31,829
a little bit scratched up a little bit

56
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:34,349
weathered but these things are tough so

57
00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:35,760
overall they're good build quality on

58
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:53,760
the on the garment now the series for

59
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,060
Apple watch this thing is truly stunning

60
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,370
like to hold in your hands does feel

61
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:01,139
like you're holding a piece of jewelry

62
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:05,519
look at that action smooth you could

63
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,829
tell Johnny Ives just like polish this

64
00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:09,720
thing clean very impressed with the

65
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,609
build quality of the Apple watch my

66
00:04:11,609 --> 00:04:12,989
previous Apple watch this is the

67
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:16,049
generation 3 Apple watch it exploded I

68
00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:19,079
mean it literally exploded what I think

69
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,729
happened to some salt water got under

70
00:04:20,729 --> 00:04:23,220
the screen battery expanded screen

71
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,530
popped off but it's shattered these

72
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:28,020
things are not built as tough as say a

73
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,570
watch that looks like this the Apple

74
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:39,060
watch is next up is the galaxy watch I

75
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,500
will say the new galaxy watch has a

76
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,660
certain heft to it it's stainless steel

77
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,700
it feels dense compared to the old

78
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,849
Galaxy gear watches it has a great

79
00:04:47,849 --> 00:04:50,010
weight to it it feels really solid the

80
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:52,860
plat the bottom on this is plastic it

81
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,260
does feel a little bit I don't know it

82
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,560
feels less jewelry like and more

83
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,030
electronics like when you when you feel

84
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:01,979
that but it still has a substantial feel

85
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:05,760
to it and the mechanics on it feel feel

86
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:09,120
great here that the galaxy watch does

87
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,650
have the weight of the stainless steel

88
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:11,640
which is beautiful

89
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,140
overall I've got to give it to the

90
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,750
Phoenix 5 with the best build you can

91
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,280
hit this thing with a hammer and not

92
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,150
Fraser's just kidding next up is the

93
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:23,190
ecosystem starting with our control

94
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,849
watch this is just a watch it doesn't

95
00:05:25,849 --> 00:05:28,080
doesn't have an eco system there's no

96
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,050
eco system none next up is the Phoenix 5

97
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:33,870
now you can download new watch faces on

98
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:37,050
the app and I think you maybe download

99
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:38,729
some apps for it and stuff but they're

100
00:05:38,729 --> 00:05:41,340
not super robust and a lot of the watch

101
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,050
faces you can download are a little bit

102
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,760
janky installing them is a little bit

103
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,310
complicated so there is some ecosystem

104
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:49,500
not a great ecosystem one thing it does

105
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,090
well though for athletes is that the

106
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:54,000
data that this collects does communicate

107
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,340
with your other exercise apps like like

108
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,110
straw or whatever it does that very well

109
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:00,300
so that's kind of the only plus I would

110
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,950
give this when it comes to ecosystem

111
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:04,349
this is an area where the Apple watch

112
00:06:04,349 --> 00:06:07,830
really thrives and that ecosystem well

113
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,510
it wasn't but after four years the

114
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,520
ecosystem is now what you would expect

115
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,650
from Apple and when you look to the new

116
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:15,390
like heart rate features that this has

117
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:18,090
the EKG features that this has I imagine

118
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:20,219
that the ecosystem around this will only

119
00:06:20,219 --> 00:06:23,340
get more and more robust and the galaxy

120
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,710
watch does have an impressive ecosystem

121
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:28,260
this is a watch that's designed mainly

122
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:31,110
for use with Android devices like your

123
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:34,260
like your Galaxy Notes or whatever it is

124
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,260
that you use but this doesn't use

125
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:38,940
androids watch OS or whatever the hell

126
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,409
it's called this uses a proprietary

127
00:06:40,409 --> 00:06:42,810
operating system that is owned by

128
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:45,810
Samsung called Tizen Wow I think the

129
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:47,760
operating system is really amazing on

130
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:51,090
this it is limited in its its ecosystem

131
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:53,459
because the only watches that carry it

132
00:06:53,459 --> 00:06:57,560
are these Samsung watches

133
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,150
one caveat that I would say there about

134
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:02,490
the Galaxy Watts it's kind of

135
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:04,200
frustrating about the Apple watch is

136
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,370
that the Apple watch doesn't allow

137
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:07,200
third-party developers to design watch

138
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,210
faces for it so it's pretty limited the

139
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:11,010
galaxy watch does allow third-party

140
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:12,330
developers to make faces for it so

141
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:13,800
there's a broader selection here I don't

142
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:19,100
know why Apple's so that's so limiting

143
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,560
[Music]

144
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,250
capability this is where I want to spend

145
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,720
most of the times I think this is what

146
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,650
differentiates these four devices see

147
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:29,760
spoiler alert I don't know that I can

148
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,470
say one is better than the other so

149
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:33,320
really depends on what your needs are

150
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,840
with that if you don't need a computer

151
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,270
strapped to your wrist then you just get

152
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:41,550
a damn watch you never have to think

153
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:43,680
about it Ozzie tells you the time now if

154
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,320
you want some smart capabilities well

155
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,790
this is why I like the Garmin watch

156
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:51,300
because for me it gives you the bare

157
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,190
minimum of what you would kind of want

158
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,810
so when you get a phone call it shows up

159
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,490
on here you can't answer it on here you

160
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:58,320
can't talk on here same with text

161
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,880
messages it shows you the full text

162
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,920
message on here beyond that when it

163
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,570
comes to athletics I want my heart rate

164
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:05,820
I want my my distance measured I want

165
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,860
maps and and this does all of that and

166
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,480
does that incredibly well

167
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,200
so the capabilities on on this watch are

168
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,210
vastly superior to just a regular old

169
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:16,740
dumb watch but they aren't quite as

170
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,450
robust is like a full-fledged

171
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:21,000
smart watch this watch is basically a

172
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,520
miniaturized iPhone strapped to your

173
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,890
wrist and that could be a good thing or

174
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:27,330
that could be a bad thing I will say

175
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:30,570
historically I've gotten almost every

176
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:32,640
I've gotten to I Apple watches before

177
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,770
but I've stopped wearing both of them

178
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:37,320
because it just ended up being too much

179
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,060
on my wrist more than I wanted to deal

180
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:42,210
with III didn't need all of that there

181
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:44,490
when it was all in my pocket like I

182
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,770
don't I don't know why this exists but I

183
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:49,890
love this I can watch my own YouTube

184
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:53,820
videos on this watch now that's a that's

185
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,350
a third-party app that probably

186
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:59,610
shouldn't exist but it does exist and I

187
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:01,800
don't know I think that that's cool also

188
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,290
for my capabilities perspective the

189
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:06,540
operating system on the Galaxy watch I

190
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,180
think is is certainly the best operating

191
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:09,480
system

192
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,790
any SmartWatch see because this is a

193
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:13,860
round watch face when you bring up your

194
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:17,040
apps like that you use this dial to

195
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,959
navigate your apps and when you want to

196
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,490
get into an app you just kind of tap it

197
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:22,320
in the middle now comparing that the

198
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,930
Apple watch where you do have a dial but

199
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:28,139
it's this sort of is useful but touching

200
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:30,300
and rotating this tiny little crown

201
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,920
isn't quite as intuitive as having one

202
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,230
here so judging the capabilities of

203
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,910
these devices is very hard because

204
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,860
quantity the amount of things it can do

205
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,470
is less important to the user and how

206
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:42,029
well it can do the few things that are

207
00:09:42,029 --> 00:09:44,519
important to you but the Garmin watch

208
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:46,880
only does a few things but it does them

209
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,290
incredibly well the Apple watch does a

210
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:50,760
lot of things but much for how many of

211
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,980
those things are going to actually use

212
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:54,540
same with the galaxy watch does a lot of

213
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,550
things but how many of those things am I

214
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,949
gonna actually use and this really

215
00:09:58,949 --> 00:10:00,540
underscores what is kind of my

216
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,949
conclusion on this whole thing when it

217
00:10:01,949 --> 00:10:04,050
comes to judging which box is best for

218
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:06,209
you the first question is what do you

219
00:10:06,209 --> 00:10:06,959
need it for

220
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,230
and then last up the easiest is battery

221
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:13,139
life so a regular watch watch a quartz

222
00:10:13,139 --> 00:10:16,199
timed battery operated watch batteries

223
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:17,850
last several years we'll just call that

224
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,459
ever the single most impressive part

225
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:22,470
about the Garmin is that this thing even

226
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:24,870
though it has a full-color screen that's

227
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:26,459
pretty low resolution and not that

228
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,680
bright but a full color screen this

229
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,110
battery depending on how much you use

230
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:33,240
the GPS this battery will ask you two

231
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,670
weeks if you use the GPS a lot it'll

232
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,949
last you like five days the battery in

233
00:10:37,949 --> 00:10:40,769
this is incredibly impressive so much so

234
00:10:40,769 --> 00:10:42,449
that when I travel I typically don't

235
00:10:42,449 --> 00:10:44,250
bring the charger with me the Apple

236
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,709
watch they say gets a full day I don't

237
00:10:46,709 --> 00:10:48,209
know why they're so modest about this

238
00:10:48,209 --> 00:10:49,829
I've only used it for a couple of days

239
00:10:49,829 --> 00:10:52,589
but so far I get way more than a full

240
00:10:52,589 --> 00:10:55,769
day it's not quite as good as the galaxy

241
00:10:55,769 --> 00:10:57,449
watch which gives you four days but I

242
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:58,680
would say it's somewhere between the

243
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,240
full day - advertised in the four days

244
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,900
that this gives you

245
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,850
[Music]

246
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:09,460
so the conclusion here is that it's very

247
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:13,210
very hard to objectively judge something

248
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:15,880
like a SmartWatch because it has a lot

249
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,950
less to do with the technical

250
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:20,500
capabilities and far more to do with

251
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,140
what exactly are you looking for in

252
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,510
something that lives on your wrist I

253
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:28,060
hate having to charge my cell phones

254
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:30,400
every single day and one of the reasons

255
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,020
why I've never stuck with the SmartWatch

256
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,120
is because I hate having to also charge

257
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,580
my watch every single day I also have a

258
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:39,370
tendency to break everything everything

259
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:41,589
I touch so the robustness of a watch is

260
00:11:41,589 --> 00:11:43,570
a big priority for me there's been a lot

261
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,040
of chatter about the Apple watch I think

262
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,870
it's deserving of most of that chatter

263
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:49,210
because it is a very impressive device I

264
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:51,580
do think this is the very best watch you

265
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,680
could have on Android even though it

266
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,070
doesn't run Android operating system so

267
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:59,770
in conclusion which is best I don't know

268
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:01,540
it really depends on what you want but

269
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,940
what is exciting is that they're they're

270
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:06,820
all pretty damn good I wouldn't

271
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:10,450
underestimate these more simple athletic

272
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:13,300
watches if you don't like the square on

273
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,070
your wrist I wouldn't underestimate what

274
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:17,380
the galaxy watch can do if you don't

275
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,089
like carrying around a cell phone I

276
00:12:19,089 --> 00:12:21,190
wouldn't underestimate what a Smart

277
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:24,850
Watch with an LTE chip in it could do

278
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:26,440
I think we've arrived at a very

279
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,500
interesting place with wearables and I'm

280
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,480
excited about where they go next that is

281
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,339
it for this week's tech Tuesday we'll

282
00:12:33,339 --> 00:12:35,230
see you back here next Tuesday with a

283
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:38,280
great new intro from Dan mates

284
00:12:38,280 --> 00:13:00,000
