ah you're about to meet a man who barely

22
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:47,110
survived a shark attack and is now an

23
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:49,390
inspiration to all of us three years ago

24
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:51,369
Paul de Gelder was with the Australian

25
00:01:51,369 --> 00:01:53,229
Navy part of an elite dive team on a

26
00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:55,300
dive to test new counterterrorism

27
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,130
hardware and then he was suddenly

28
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:59,860
attacked by a bull shark I'm Australian

29
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,950
I opened up for Snoop Dogg in 1998 which

30
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,420
was pretty cool wait and what capacity

31
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,250
did you open up for Snoop Dogg I was a

32
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,200
rapper if I YouTube searched I find a

33
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,579
video of you rapping you can't find a

34
00:02:09,579 --> 00:02:10,929

[Music]

39
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:33,300
it was the epitome of a shocky day it

40
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,040
was early in the morning Sydney Harbour

41
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,160
so murky water it was overcast I was on

42
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,230
my back in a black wetsuit and black

43
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:43,290
fins kicking my leg a bull shark came up

44
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:44,820
from underneath me and grabbed me by the

45
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,880
leg and the hand in the same bite

46
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,200
decided it wanted them more than I did

47
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,180
and started tearing me apart and took me

48
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,550
underwater in total agony drowning me

49
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:56,190
losing blood nearly dead ripped out my

50
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:59,610
hamstring and took off my hand and so I

51
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:02,130
had to swim back to my safety boat

52
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:04,980
missing a hand and part of my leg

53
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,470
through a pool of my own blood where my

54
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,360
buddies were waiting to give me first

55
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,880
day

56
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:28,459
[Music]

57
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:31,250
and they did that they kept me alive one

58
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,379
of the guys had to stick his hand inside

59
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,359
my leg and pinch closed one of the

60
00:03:35,359 --> 00:03:38,060
arteries and a week later I decided to

61
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,310
have the leg removed because I couldn't

62
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,870
feel it I couldn't move it it was gonna

63
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,670
be useless for the rest of my life so I

64
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:45,829
just thought stuff that I'll just get

65
00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:47,599
them to turn me into a terminator how

66
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,549
did you swim with no arm and no leg

67
00:03:51,549 --> 00:03:56,480
slowly but I know we get trained to deal

68
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,700
with very stressful situations how do

69
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,840
they train you to deal with a situation

70
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,500
that that was that was you know up a few

71
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,450
tears from what I was used to but the

72
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:07,069
medical training kicked in and I thought

73
00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:09,799
okay my hands missing I'm bleeding I've

74
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:11,780
got to keep that wound above my heart so

75
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,419
I'm swimming like that with one arm out

76
00:04:14,419 --> 00:04:15,109
of the water

77
00:04:15,109 --> 00:04:16,729
kicking one leg because I couldn't even

78
00:04:16,729 --> 00:04:20,239
feel the other leg and just going really

79
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:21,949
slow at the same time the guys in the

80
00:04:21,949 --> 00:04:23,870
play are coming over towards me I didn't

81
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:24,800
even think I was gonna make it

82
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,630
I thought the shark was gonna come back

83
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,520
it was gonna grab you by the ankle take

84
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,110
me down and kill me so it didn't matter

85
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:32,150
all I had to do was just keep trying

86
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:35,000
until that happened show us your how

87
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,430
does this work so this is called the

88
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,650
Michelangelo it's a made in Germany

89
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:42,320
it's about $19,000 for this thing I

90
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,120
think it's the best robotic hand in the

91
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:48,050
world but mostly just because I can

92
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:50,199
change it from this grip to

93
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:54,110
beer-drinking grip if you're gonna have

94
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:56,599
a $90,000 robot arm it might as well

95
00:04:56,599 --> 00:04:58,550
have a beer-drinking group so the first

96
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:02,000
time I met Paul was this past summer and

97
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,490
you had on pants so I didn't see your

98
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:08,060
leg yeah and he's just like a like Jack

99
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,759
tattoo dude and I went and shook his

100
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:13,310
hand ready okay but when you grab on

101
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,349
there's like a proper squeeze there well

102
00:05:15,349 --> 00:05:17,000
that's still the go grip though what's

103
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,789
fun but it's not painful but if I don't

104
00:05:19,789 --> 00:05:21,500
know you or you've been a bit of a dick

105
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,090
I may just squeeze down a little bit

106
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:25,130
extra and wait for the flicker in your

107
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:28,820
eyes I think you just right like you

108
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,669
have me you could do it everyone the

109
00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:34,340
last time the the version before this I

110
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,110
had

111
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:37,410
chillie snapped in half armwrestling

112
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:39,280
unfortunately you were armwrestling with

113
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,560
a prosthetic hand like that with a girl

114
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,080
there may have been some product oral

115
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,640
damage there was some cracks in it

116
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,900
because I'm pretty hard on this I'm

117
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,640
about as hard on my prosthetics as you

118
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,920
are on everything so I lost the hand and

119
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,320
the leg if I was gonna lose just one it

120
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,590
would not be a hand take the leg take

121
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,840
the leg you can replace a leg so I've

122
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,730
got a running blade I've got a swimming

123
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,440
leg I've got a diving leg I've got this

124
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:06,820
amazing $200,000 leg but you cannot

125
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:10,240
replace a hand not yet there's no Luke

126
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,790
Skywalker hand out yet and what allows

127
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,740
you to get back in the water three

128
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,450
months later what is it from inside of

129
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:18,700
you that lets you do that it's a deep

130
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:21,040
love for being in the water for me I

131
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,960
don't think you can get any closer to

132
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,120
being an actual part of nature than

133
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,890
being completely submerged in the ocean

134
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:30,310
it's relaxing it alleviates stresses and

135
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:32,770
fears and you feel relaxed and it can

136
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:34,930
wash away a lot of the stresses that are

137
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:36,490
impacted on you throughout your life

138
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:38,470
have you met Arnold Schwarzenegger yeah

139
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:41,740
yeah I know him huge knowledge to you

140
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,330
that you're closer to the Terminator

141
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:45,910
than he ever is not quite

life sharks and public speaking now I

149
