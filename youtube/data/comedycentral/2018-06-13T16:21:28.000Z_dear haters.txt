before I see it that I thought your

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,850
intro to yesterday's tech Tuesday was

30
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:09,470
filmmaking perfection linked below if

31
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:13,549
you haven't seen it so I was reading

32
00:02:13,549 --> 00:02:17,090
some YouTube comments and I read poeple

33
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:19,430
that really hurt my feelings and I

34
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,829
wanted to address them the gist of these

35
00:02:21,829 --> 00:02:24,320
negative comments were like what

36
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,570
happened to three six eight I knew it

37
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:28,850
was bullsh this is just a regular vlog

38
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:30,920
why don't you talk about three six eight

39
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,810
anymore three six eight is a fraud you

40
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:34,549
don't know anything about business

41
00:02:34,549 --> 00:02:37,070
look it hurts my feelings because it's

42
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:39,470
wrong and I took all this time in a

43
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,390
previous episode to explain as clearly

44
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:45,650
as I could to these haters that less

45
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:48,560
sharing intention more sharing action I

46
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,660
said this yet these people these haters

47
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:54,140
these mega Megatron's are bringing me

48
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,569
down and it made me think of one of my

49
00:02:56,569 --> 00:02:58,609
favorite fake Chinese proverbs which is

50
00:02:58,609 --> 00:03:01,220
people who say it can't be done should

51
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,739
not interrupt those who are doing it I'm

52
00:03:03,739 --> 00:03:07,160
doing it stop interrupting me with your

53
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,690
negative YouTube comments that are

54
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:09,829
hurting my feelings

55
00:03:09,829 --> 00:03:11,750
so this update is for those haters

56
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,000
those doubters let me show you a little

57
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,150
bit of what 3 6 8 has been up

58
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:18,900
[Music]

59
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,329
you see once the Death Star is fully up

60
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:23,370
once three six eight is fully

61
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,650
operational then almost every episode

62
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:27,870
the narrative of every episode will be

63
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,230
about three six eight

64
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:32,519
doesn't mean what I'm making progress a

65
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:36,060
lot of progress remember how it used to

66
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,790
be one gigantic huge open space well now

67
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:40,879
we put it in a wall to see this wall

68
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,549
this makes this fun fun space break its

69
00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:46,409
own little space and what we're gonna do

70
00:03:46,409 --> 00:03:49,799
with this like separate room we're gonna

71
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:51,900
make this room a retail space like a

72
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,670
space that's open to the public it's not

73
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:55,470
open to the public yet but it will be

74
00:03:55,470 --> 00:04:03,989
open to the public construction team

75
00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:05,970
this space will be open to the public

76
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:07,439
this would be a retail store this will

77
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,599
be an art installation space for the

78
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,810
first first exhibition we're gonna do

79
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:14,340
we're putting a tattoo artist in here

80
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,620
and in the window you can come and watch

81
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:29,190
him do tattoos closes it opens up the

82
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:31,020
front space to the back space it's not

83
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,580
something that we need or are interested

84
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,760
also maybe hard to tell on camera but

85
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,349
it's all a beautiful shade of white back

86
00:04:37,349 --> 00:04:39,510
here because we painted the entire space

87
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:41,220
you might notice it's a little bit

88
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,050
darker in here than it used to be that's

89
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:45,030
because we tore out all of the track

90
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:46,830
lighting so you could be tracked lights

91
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,659
that run the entire length of this space

92
00:04:48,659 --> 00:04:50,699
we tore them all out we're gonna redo

93
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:52,710
all the lighting that's happening that's

94
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:55,199
happening now that's what this is all

95
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,150
about and you see the investments in new

96
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,909
hardware here we've got 265 inch cubes

97
00:04:59,909 --> 00:05:01,409
and then right here we have the

98
00:05:01,409 --> 00:05:03,060
granddaddy the biggest Hewett on the

99
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,949
market eighty eight incher we're not a

100
00:05:04,949 --> 00:05:06,330
hundred percent sure where these

101
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:07,800
monitors are gonna be used but I think

102
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,570
the eighty eight incher is gonna be for

103
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:13,449
our new gaming setup this is

104
00:05:13,449 --> 00:05:16,120
this is excited the three six eight

105
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,819
kitchen the kitchen this is where we can

106
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,520
have our dinners this is where we cannot

107
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,689
creators who do like cooking channels

108
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:24,069
and stuff like that coming prepare a

109
00:05:24,069 --> 00:05:25,960
meal for people it's being built out

110
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,969
right now this is the countertop bar

111
00:05:27,969 --> 00:05:29,860
area they'll be a sink here there's

112
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,839
gonna be a stove here a refrigerator

113
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:33,610
here and then look look at this right

114
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:37,870
here we already put in water we had to

115
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,300
put water in here we had a pipe plumbing

116
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:44,080
pipe with the this is water we had to

117
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,249
put this in you know complicated that is

118
00:05:47,249 --> 00:05:51,219
and probably most importantly the three

119
00:05:51,219 --> 00:05:53,680
six eight team is being built out can't

120
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,330
introduce them yet because there's an HR

121
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:57,310
process that we have to work through but

122
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:00,759
you'll know I'm soon enough sorry guys

123
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:09,089
it's okay

124
00:06:09,089 --> 00:06:11,680
you see three six eight the idea the

125
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,360
business it's all predicated on first

126
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,309
having the perfect space and lower

127
00:06:15,309 --> 00:06:18,069
Manhattan for creators until we have

128
00:06:18,069 --> 00:06:20,080
that we can't really kick things off and

129
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,729
that's what we've been focused on it's

130
00:06:21,729 --> 00:06:23,229
been just under two months we've made

131
00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:26,379
significant progress and well we're

132
00:06:26,379 --> 00:06:31,200
almost there

133
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,640
that over there that's Queens that over

134
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:39,360
there that's that's Manhattan I'm headed

135
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,200
to Queens

136
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,730
it's a lovely place I don't know if I've

137
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:43,140
actually ever been there in the blog

138
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:55,920
before lovely place and now I'm in

139
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,800
Queens not entirely sure where to where

140
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:05,120
to go

141
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,310
right on Jackson Avenue left on 21st

142
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:10,530
Street see as much as I love this city I

143
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:13,170
seldom leave like a 10 to 15 block

144
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:19,980
radius around worthy offices so this is

145
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,680
a part of the world called Long Island

146
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,370
City

147
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:25,200
it's called Long Island City but it's

148
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,060
it's actually Queens it's still very

149
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,220
much so New York City but short of

150
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,810
running the New York City Marathon which

151
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:32,340
comes through here I don't think I've

152
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,200
ever been to Long Island City before

153
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:47,160
it's awesome out here alright I'm back

154
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,130
in Manhattan let me explain what

155
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:52,560
happened I was all the way out in Long

156
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,710
Island City because my dear friend Gary

157
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,510
Vaynerchuk who's also one my favorite

158
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,310
people on planet Earth asked me to do

159
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:01,260
something with his his company out there

160
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,390
and of course like any excuse to work

161
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:06,390
with Gary his team was amazing and they

162
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:09,480
gave me directions but then I was like I

163
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,220
was like Dorothy seeing the Emerald City

164
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,140
for the first time Long Island City was

165
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:15,180
awesome and I was like checking the

166
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,770
