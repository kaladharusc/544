whether tell me if I pitch this right

125
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,410

a total jerk to be like a good boss more

127
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,120
specifically to be a good movie director

128
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,220
do you need to be a dick to being

129
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:28,040
successful right it's like Steve Jobs is

130

a notorious dick he's such a good

business leader do they do they go hand

132
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,150
in hand is there a correlation between

133
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,920
being a dick and a good business leader

134
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,560
to find out watch back to the movie link

these guys do not like it when I film

141
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,639
here a long time viewer of the vlog you

142
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:09,050
might remember I used to live near here

143
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:11,389
and I film these guys because they smell

144
00:08:11,389 --> 00:08:13,610
counterfeit handbags and they threatened

145
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:19,340
to I just want you the audience to know

146
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,200
that I did offer Max here a boosted

147
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,360
board and he declined the offer he said

148
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,710
he doesn't feel comfortable on a boosted

149
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:27,050
board so the city bike thing was his

150
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:30,169
idea how do you feel doing grain what a

151

[Music]

156
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,360
the reason why Max is in town right now

157
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,540
is you know let's go dot New York City

father-son thing it's amazing

165
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:27,430
