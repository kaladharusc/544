5
00:00:27,489 --> 00:00:30,880
taught in the city by Billy Idol was

6
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,050
written when he lived in a one-bedroom

7
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:34,360
studio there was like a hundred degrees

8
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,360
out in that air-conditioned mat that was

9
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:44,010
his inspiration for that song great song

10
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:50,280
[Applause]

11
00:00:50,280 --> 00:01:00,340
don't be afraid it's not like you're in

12
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,080
Arizona or someone like that it's not

13
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,850
crazy hot but look 93 that's pretty hot

14
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:11,650
for New York City ah something I really

15
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:13,870
like to do here on YouTube is find

16
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:17,979
smaller or newer or less well-known

17
00:01:17,979 --> 00:01:21,130
youtubers and then share those youtubers

18
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:23,290
that I really like with you my audience

19
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:24,970
I like to do that because it kind of

20
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:26,440
gives them a little bit more exposure

21
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,810
and I like to think that if you watch

22
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:30,640
this channel that you're also interested

23
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,369
in what I'm interested in any event I

24
00:01:33,369 --> 00:01:35,500
have a youtuber that's coming by right

25
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,930

26
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:42,250
meet but first

27
00:01:42,250 --> 00:02:05,509

this is Molly Molly G youtuber we met at

32
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,880
VidCon yes okay and this is how it went

33
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,920
I walk into some lounge or something

34
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,690
like that they're all over Pacifica I

35
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,640
heard somebody whisper I think that's

36
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,519
Casey nice dad and I think I like tiny

37
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:36,720
hear that a lot so I didn't think much

38
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,730
of it I turned around and went to see

39
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:41,250
you said that so I could say hi and then

40
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:45,150
I saw this rule right here say well is

41
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,849
it him or is it not him and whoever you

42
00:02:47,849 --> 00:02:49,380
see news like I can't tell him you like

43
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:52,230
well I can't tell I'm blind I can't see

44
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:55,140
him is it Casey or not that time at

45
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,209
Molly and that's how I found out that

46
00:02:57,209 --> 00:02:59,010
you can't see yes

47
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:03,299
so how is someone both blind and a

48
00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:07,350
youtuber Molly well there was a bit more

49
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:09,239
that went into the decision to make

50
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:11,100
youtube videos and maybe for most people

51
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,560
because obviously like I can't set up my

52
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,389
camera on my lighting I can't make sure

53
00:03:15,389 --> 00:03:16,049
I'm in focus

54
00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:19,109
I can't edit my videos and so there was

55
00:03:19,109 --> 00:03:20,970
there was more that had to go into

56
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,739
figuring all that out and my mom comes

57
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:24,510
down and she films with me so she'll

58
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,579
make sure I'm in focus she takes the

59
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:28,950
thumbnail so in short I always have a

60
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:30,959
mom that you trust to tell you you look

61
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,760
good on camera I would say I'm like

62
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,010
Cinderella I have my own talking mirror

63
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:37,350
everywhere I go and mine ears name is

64
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,250
mom have you always been blind

65
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:43,829
I've always been visually impaired I

66
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:46,650
haven't always been blind until I was 14

67
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:49,019
and in grade 8 the disease was kind of

68
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:51,359
triggered and I lost pretty much the

69
00:03:51,359 --> 00:03:53,069
majority of my vision to what I have now

70
00:03:53,069 --> 00:03:55,290
what can you see now like what do you

71
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:57,389
see now like there's a bright light

72
00:03:57,389 --> 00:03:59,790
there's bright light and then there's me

73
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,650
and there's I can't like what what do

74
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:04,260
you see so I see the world in light and

75
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,060
shadow I can see light so I can see that

76
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,790
there's a big square of light and like I

77
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,769
can see that there's a little bulb above

78
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:12,360
us and that there's different light and

79
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,860
that there's strips of lighting on the

80
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:14,430
ceiling

81
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,410
I have is like globe light pane over

82
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:19,410
there but I can't see or no depth

83
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:21,630
perception rather so I don't know if

84
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,520
that light is in touching distance or if

85
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,889
it's far away can you see me at all see

86
00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:28,050
when you like look towards the light and

87
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,669
stop I can see that there's their

88
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:31,380
shining on your glasses so if I sit

89
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,320
right there I can see that your glasses

90
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,530
all right they're two little spots

91
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:38,400
that's all I see

92
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,139
so then everything around those two

93
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:41,699
little spots reflecting off your glasses

94
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:44,160
is totally black so you don't know what

95
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:44,669
I look like

96
00:04:44,669 --> 00:04:47,330
not at all before you lost your vision

97
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:50,190
did you ever see a movie with Brad Pitt

98
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:53,639
in it what got you to a place of wanting

99
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:56,220
to share so much of who you are in your

100
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,050
life to the world

101
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:00,030
Florine been a big problem it was a big

102
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:02,160
part of my life when I lost my vision I

103
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,039
also lost all of my friends and and so I

104
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,360
could take this negative thing that

105
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,530
happened to me and make it something

106
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,240
positive for other people we're going to

107
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,660
go outside now and Molly's unit share

108
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,789

00:05:14,789 --> 00:05:17,130

corner then I'll ask him to find the

166
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,980
door yes

167
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:09,420
do you smell like everything see you

168
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:12,510
learn like he looks like old eerie music

169
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:27,969
from that store

170
00:08:27,969 --> 00:08:32,330
into the south

171
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:36,760
so it's positive

172
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:41,649
oh I'm talking out goes okay you so much

173
00:08:41,649 --> 00:08:45,629
yes

174
00:08:45,629 --> 00:08:47,980
how do you know whether it's your turn

175
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:51,129
order is it my turn order yes that's how

176
00:08:51,129 --> 00:08:54,339
I know so how do you notice someone's

177
00:08:54,339 --> 00:08:56,499
dropping you often we go

178
00:08:56,499 --> 00:08:59,859
really but how do I touch their country

179
00:08:59,859 --> 00:09:02,649
you have to ask them to help you you

180
00:09:02,649 --> 00:09:08,139
know how do you know like what sugar to

181
00:09:08,139 --> 00:09:11,649
put into your coffee I asked okay so I'm

182
00:09:11,649 --> 00:09:15,720
going to take off my blindfold

183
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:22,120
Wow that was an absolutely like jarring

184
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,630
experience for me

185
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,810
it was really like everything I knew

186
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:30,600
about life here hearing it in a

187
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,490
different once we recessed did you're

188
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:34,649
experiencing it with your ears with your

189
00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:37,290
nose with your hands like I always say

190
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:38,970
my hands are my eyes because I'm always

191
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:41,220
a touching thing my more than that like

192
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:44,459
you know you know in a weird way and I

193
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:46,259
said it very gently

194
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:50,190
it was much scarier the phrase I didn't

195
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:53,490
touch somebody but I was afraid that she

196
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,319
was unitard me too much my coffee they

197
00:09:55,319 --> 00:09:57,300
never would hear resident and gentleman

198
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,220
from their perfect unfree ruining it by

199
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,620
car as a pre we're going to offend the

200
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:04,079
people around us how the princess

201
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,889
doesn't even get the right coffee like I

202
00:10:06,889 --> 00:10:10,230
think how you think you know what this

203
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:13,440
is I always helpful for you I just bring

204
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,420
you into this experience and you've

205
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,860
never done it before

206
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,300
of course it's going to feel really

207
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,130
scary and it's probably going to feel

208
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:22,620
overwhelming and it's probably going to

209
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:25,199
feel like you can't do it but the

210
00:10:25,199 --> 00:10:28,889
reality is this is lying on this is my

211
00:10:28,889 --> 00:10:30,930
everyday and for people who are in

212
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,759
wheelchairs for people who are blind for

213
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:34,949
people who are deaf or missing a limb

214
00:10:34,949 --> 00:10:36,899
this is our normal you know I've been

215
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:38,100
blind for nine years

216
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,310
I don't know life's excitement so for me

217
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:42,990
asking for people to help me all the

218
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:45,540
time or for me listening to the traffic

219
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,509
surges or for me listening and smelling

220
00:10:48,509 --> 00:10:50,220
different places know where I am is

221
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,230
north and so to me it's not difficult

222
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:54,750
and it's not scary and it's not jarring

223
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:59,009
it's not and it's just like I wake up I

224
