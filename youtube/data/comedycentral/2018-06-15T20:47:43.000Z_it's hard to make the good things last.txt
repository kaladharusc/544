1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:05,879
so being a youtuber it's the greatest

2
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:08,370
job ever and because of this job and

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,440
what I do I've gotten to do some of the

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,840
most incredible things that I could have

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,660
ever imagined when I was a kid and I

6
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,090
think the greatest thing about being a

7
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:19,830
youtuber about being creator having a

8
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,470
big audience has been the people that

9
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,439
I've gotten to meet and when I think of

10
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:26,820
all the people that I get to meet like

11
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,179
what is the most what's the most special

12
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:32,969
in there at the very apex of that

13
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:35,760
pyramid at the very very top has been

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,530
the individuals I've gotten to meet

15
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,149
through the make-a-wish Foundation and

16
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:41,040
make-a-wish is an organization that

17
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,500
takes very sick young people and kids

18
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,600
and grants them a wish maybe they want

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,399
to get a Disneyworld or surf in Hawaii

20
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:49,920
or go to a movie set and there's been a

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,579
couple of kids whose dream it's been is

22
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:57,360
was to meet me and one of those young

23
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,859
people was a young man by the name of

24
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:02,460
Errol and maybe you saw the episode I'll

25
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,500

know each other and he's like a

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,799
fantastic musician and we went to the

29
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,320
park and he played the piano and we had

30
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,909
lunch with Candice and we drove around

31
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:17,430
on a limousine and like greatest day

32
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,450
ever and at the end of like this awesome

33
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,689
day I said there was like arrow like why

34
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:27,000
me like why do want to pick me I know

35
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,619
you don't want to be a youtuber why me

36
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:31,259
and he was like Casey I've seen how you

37
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:33,299
can bring attention to causes you

38
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:35,490
believe in and I wanted to talk to you

39
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:36,869
about bringing attention to a cause that

40
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:39,630
I believed in and at the end of that it

41
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,250
was like the reason why this kid used

42
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,850
his one wish to spend time with me is

43
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:47,909
because he thought working with me would

44
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:49,970
be an amazing Avenue to bring attention

45
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:53,640
to others who are in need like a total

46
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,579
act of selflessness but all he wanted to

47
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:58,810
do was to help others

48
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:01,090
I got just like blew my mind you know

49
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:02,409
when I was his age I was like smoking

50
00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:04,540
pot and chasing girls and here's this

51
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:07,479
young man who's sick trying to trying to

52
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:14,080
spend his life to help others so so that

53
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,819
was a that was that was many months ago

54
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:19,450
that he and I connected and loosely kept

55
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:21,849
in touch and kept track of Eros since we

56
00:02:21,849 --> 00:02:24,489
spent that wonderful day together and a

57
00:02:24,489 --> 00:02:26,140
family friend of his reached out to me

58
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,690
on about a week ago letting me know

59
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,690
Eero wasn't doing well and then they got

60
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:33,100
in touch with me yesterday let me know

61
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:37,959
that Errol had passed away if you watch

62
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:39,700
the video below he doesn't seem sick

63
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,380
which is it's even harder for me to

64
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:44,769
really understand because um in any

65
00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:50,019
event he's no longer with us and you

66
00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:53,830
know anytime I experience a loss of life

67
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:56,620
or someone I cared about our new goes

68
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:01,120
away it just makes me really stop and

69
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,160
think of what matters the most like what

70
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,970
is most important and I love things like

71
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:08,890
I get excited about all my stupid

72
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:10,480
boosted boards and I get excited about

73
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,150
like camera gear and I get excited about

74
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:18,160
flying cars and and I get excited about

75
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,329
work and I mean I'm a very I I can get

76
00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:25,600
obsessive about almost anything but but

77
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,030
really what matters and the only thing

78
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:31,450
that matters is my relationship are your

79
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:34,209
relationships with other people

80
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:36,459
something that I've I say a lot

81
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:37,900
something I really believe in is that a

82
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,290
life not shared is a life not lived if

83
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:43,690
you don't share your life and share your

84
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,639
happiness with other people and let

85
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:47,859
other people into your life then are you

86
00:03:47,859 --> 00:03:52,850
really living then what's the point

87
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:56,730
so I'm just taking pause today to stop

88
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,500
and think about all the people in my

89
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,360
life that I love and I appreciate and

90
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,060
maybe you want to stop and just take a

91
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,620
moment to think about the people in your

92
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,120
lives that you appreciate because it's

93
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,920
easy to get caught up in the and the

94
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,450
 and forget about what really

95
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:13,680
matters I also just wanted to say I

96
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,680
Romero's family friend they said that it

97
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,470
was like his right up until the end he

98
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:21,660
was mostly concerned with how he could

99
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,690
help others so all linked cancer gogo

100
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:26,580
which is arils nonprofit which his

101
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,950
parents are maintaining to help kids and

102
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,330
help people who were affected like he

103
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:31,350

105
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,290

106

really sing it's I can't sing but I want

110
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:48,000
to share with you the lyrics of one of

111
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,100
my favorite songs which for me puts

112
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:54,750
things in perspective okay this song is

113
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,340
called do you realize by the Flaming

114
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,960
Lips and it's it's an incredible song

115
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,470
but it goes this is part of it but it

116
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,690
goes do you realize that everyone you

117
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:06,120
know will someday die and instead of

118
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,400
saying all of your good-byes let them

119
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,890
know you realize that life goes fast

120
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:12,840
it's hard to make the good things last

121
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,540
you realize that the Sun doesn't go down

122
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,450
it's just an illusion caused by the

123
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:23,590
world spinning round okay
