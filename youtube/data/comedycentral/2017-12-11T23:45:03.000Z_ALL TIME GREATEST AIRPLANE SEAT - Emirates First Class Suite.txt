00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,940
very excited about this

3
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:49,530

00:00:49,530 --> 00:01:18,140
[Laughter]

5
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:21,000
this is the new first class suite on

6
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,570
Emirates this is the comprehensive

7
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:27,320
review of that suite

8
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,650
[Music]

9
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:35,780
I mean it's about proper a heavy big

10
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:39,920
wooden door now more like a small but

11
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,920
extremely elegant hotel room than it

12
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,260
does an airplane seat you got your seat

13
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:49,210
which is also a bed you've got closets

14
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:53,000
two TVs and a door here that opens and

15
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:02,150
closes it goes all the way yes thank you

16
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,890
are they taking off now

17
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:13,010
[Music]

18
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:21,800
taking off

19
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,390
let me begin with a proper tour of the

20
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,310
entire suite bedroom is always a big

21
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,620
deal when flying and the legroom and

22
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,110
this the legroom borders on ridiculous

23
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,690
ready you can fit a small family down

24
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:35,730
here this is just the leg reading

25
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:38,880
situation if you were 7 or 8 feet tall

26
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,910
you couldn't use up all this legroom if

27
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,069
you were a circus clown wearing stilts

28
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:46,830
you couldn't use up all this legroom so

29
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,720
there are these little lights these

30
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,510
little lights in the carpet look I found

31
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:53,400
a TV situation here is amazing

32
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,320
you get one gigantic screen right there

33
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,870
that's like I don't know 35 inches 40

34
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,790
inches something like that that's one TV

35
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,410
and then you've got another thing over

36
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:03,360
here but these two aren't connected so

37
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,890
on your big TV you watching Pulp Fiction

38
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:10,410
and then on the iPad here you can do

39
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:19,090
other stuff

40
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:25,360
here we can see what happens with this

41
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,920
I don't need anything I just wanted to

42
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,610
see if this worked nice to see you this

43
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:36,020
is so unnecessary thank you see you no I

44
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,060
don't I don't need anything I'm gonna go

45
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:58,440
see her all right thank you

46
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:04,190
vanity mirror

47
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:07,290
and then so far I found two closets one

48
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:10,410
here this one appears to be for like

49
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:12,540
suits or jackets or anything like that I

50
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,430
didn't bring any suits so I so I just

51
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:17,519
put my skateboard in here then kind of

52
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,890
under the TV there's this big Locker and

53
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:21,480
this one's pretty massive I've got my

54
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,130
backpack in here but you can probably

55
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:26,490
put a rolling suitcase or it's big you

56
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:29,620
know like put my head in here

57
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:59,710
[Music]

58
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:08,669
[Music]

59
00:05:08,669 --> 00:05:14,400
I think I think I'm done with this

60
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,650
portion of the meal it was very good I

61
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:21,719
couldn't finish it I was too much stuff

62
00:05:21,719 --> 00:05:25,439
staking a few bit of the sunset but not

63
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:28,220
a lot of it if you want to

64
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:32,390
be fantastic so what are these these are

65
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:35,480
just like TV screens so these are just

66
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,060
like LCD screens of what's going on out

67
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:38,510
there

68
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:48,319
those are cameras where look like

69
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:53,060
Oh

70
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:56,430
now this isn't the long-haul flight of

71
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:59,250
the a380 which has the showers and the

72
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:02,880
gigantic spa on it but this is a nice

73
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,880
bathroom is it very comfortable I don't

74
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,150
work this is turkey or air fresh never

75
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:12,060
both Gary 11 bars of soap I don't know

76
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,680
what you would need eleven bars of soap

77
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,910
or but they have eleven bars and so

78
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:20,550
cloth towels that's it I'm gonna go back

79
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:24,360
to my back to my room

80
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,400
now this seat itself is supposed to be

81
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,849
pretty magical this is the standard

82
00:06:29,849 --> 00:06:35,000
takeoff and landing position

83
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,860
a dining position

84
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,750
this is something called zero gravity

85
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,819
where it's supposed to make it feel like

86
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:47,169
this is very nice

87
00:06:47,169 --> 00:06:48,879
she told me that when I was ready to go

88
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:50,499
to bed that I had to get her and she

89
00:06:50,499 --> 00:06:51,790
would make the bed

90
00:06:51,790 --> 00:07:08,690

I will now attempt to fly my drone

94
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:40,340
inside this airplane

95
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:59,270

really was all it was cracked up to be

100
00:08:31,629 --> 00:08:33,799
it was everything I ever wanted

101
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:43,190
