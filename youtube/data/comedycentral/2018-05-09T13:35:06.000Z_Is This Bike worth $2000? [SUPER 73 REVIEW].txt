like a nerd I think you look like a

00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,520
a lot of people have been asking about

00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:29,780
my bike so let's talk about my bike

today's tick review cheese never advised

10
00:00:46,420 --> 00:01:16,600
me to travel back in time I've always

11
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,369
sought means of transportation that are

12
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:19,750
different from likes public

13
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,819
transportations subways too noisy and

14
00:01:21,819 --> 00:01:24,030
crowded

15
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:27,940
buses are too slow calves are too

16
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:33,400
expensive drying is impractical walking

17
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,820
this doesn't cover enough distance now

18
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,170
if you've watched this vlog you know

19
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:39,850
that my favorite means of transport are

20
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:44,140
my boosted boards so I have so many of

21
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:46,270
them a couple weeks ago I got one of

22
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:46,900
these bikes

23
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:51,040
it's called the super 73 and it's really

24
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,820
really interesting a little history on

25
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,790
the super 73 the parent companies called

26
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:00,070
lithium cycles and they launched as a

27
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:03,040
Kickstarter in 2016 they started

28
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,390
shipping these bikes I want to say in

29
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:07,869
early 2017 or late 2016 it's a very cool

30
00:02:07,869 --> 00:02:09,130
company they work with a lot of

31
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:11,980
youtubers and they sent me two bikes one

32
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:14,260
for Candice and one for me kind of

33
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,459
thought I'd be like a joke that would

34
00:02:15,459 --> 00:02:17,440
sit in the corner of my office this

35
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,090
thing's kind of taken over and it's the

36
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:21,400
first means of transport in New York

37
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,340
City in whatever 2 or 3 years that has

38
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,340
started to make inroads competing with

39
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,769
my boosted board for my favorite way to

40
00:02:29,769 --> 00:02:32,320
get around and now a closer look at the

41
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,500
bike

42
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:50,070
[Music]

43
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,150
right before Dan and I can actually

44
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:54,910
shoot the out in the street version of

45
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,890
this I have to have Sam teach me how to

46
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:59,050
use the stabilizer and this all that

47
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,360
totally said one secret stabilizer

48
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,370
package for mr. nice dad yeah it holds

49
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:05,590
the ATD with like the super small lenses

50
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,510
it's really useful you think you can

51
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:11,260
handle it I don't know I'm scared of

52
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:16,480
like riding and shooting but it holds

53
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,730
the camera really well yeah sort of like

54
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:21,430
a double tap are you Tuesday you mount

55
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,560
it on the bottom here and then there's a

56
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,840
bunch of different axes to balance

57
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,540
locked and twisted ready to go so it's

58
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,400
neat is if you want to get the super low

59
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,590
drop down shot you turn it over like

60
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,690
this and then you can like really get

61
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:36,820
super low to the ground and this is like

62
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:41,840
ultra ultra stable shots yeah

63
00:03:41,840 --> 00:04:01,260
[Music]

64
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:05,110
riding a regular boat gotta watch out

65
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:07,080
for potholes yeah be careful of cars

66
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,810
gotta be up guys gotta be mindful of the

67
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:16,470
handlebars sitting in between other car

68
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:18,549
most importantly you have to obey

69
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:19,970
traffic laws

70
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:25,460
[Music]

71
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:28,880
so this thing at three

72
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,440
what is this we're just pedaling like a

73
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,350
madman it's not bad but it's kind of a

74
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:37,680
heavy bike to just pedal number two

75
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,050
number two something called pedal assist

76
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:42,570
and basically what that means is after

77
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:45,510
you pedal the motor are you doing as you

78
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:47,190
pedal the motor picks up and takes off

79
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:49,740
for you it's like you have super muscled

80
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,750
superhuman superhero power and your legs

81
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,040
like watch I'm totally white already

82
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,130
watch me take off later

83
00:04:55,130 --> 00:05:00,440
[Music]

84
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:05,330
and in the lifeboat

85
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:10,040

86
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,370

[Music]

89
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,610
one advantage this thing has over other

90
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:51,680
electric bikes and bikes in general is

91
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,690
it can handle off-roading like grass

92
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:56,030
dirt gravel really well

93
00:05:56,030 --> 00:06:02,570
ready

94
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:17,159
[Music]

95
00:06:17,159 --> 00:06:20,259
so there's a lot to like about this and

96
00:06:20,259 --> 00:06:22,690
and the reason why I think that this

97
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:24,909
thing is kind of brought bikes back into

98
00:06:24,909 --> 00:06:27,009
my life in New York City is just cuz of

99
00:06:27,009 --> 00:06:29,500
how dynamic it is I put that milk crate

100
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,060
on the back so now I can haul a bunch of

101
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:33,580
things the range on its further than my

102
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,740
skateboard it's faster than a regular

103
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:38,530
bicycle I don't get all sweaty I do feel

104
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:40,300
a little bit safer on a bike that I do

105
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,610
on a skateboard but there are concerns

106
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,020
with riding an electric bike in a city

107
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,789
like New York for example up until a

108
00:06:45,789 --> 00:06:47,860
month ago electric bikes were completely

109
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,930
outlawed did you know that it wasn't

110
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:51,729
like as in January they completely out

111
00:06:51,729 --> 00:06:53,949
as of October of last year mayor de

112
00:06:53,949 --> 00:06:55,300
Blasio mayor of New York City

113
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,490
said no more power-assist no more

114
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:59,650
electric bikes so if cops saw you on a

115
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:01,690
bike like that they immediately take the

116
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:03,819
bike away and they give you an up to a

117
00:07:03,819 --> 00:07:08,409
$500 fine now as of April 8th of this

118
00:07:08,409 --> 00:07:10,719
year like five weeks yes about a month

119
00:07:10,719 --> 00:07:13,270
ago exactly actually to the day a month

120
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:15,490
ago exactly today the mayor announced

121
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:17,620
that that he's pulling that back and now

122
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,719
bikes are okay if they're power-assist

123
00:07:19,719 --> 00:07:21,909
as in they pedal as well which this does

124
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:24,130
so once again this bike is legal but

125
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:26,139
these are kind of the concerns when

126
00:07:26,139 --> 00:07:27,550
you're on something that looks like that

127
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:29,800
instead of a traditional bicycle but

128
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,469
there is one factor that the super 73

129
00:07:32,469 --> 00:07:35,169
has and maybe just as new but the fun

130
00:07:35,169 --> 00:07:37,539
factor I think is higher on this bike

131
00:07:37,539 --> 00:07:39,699
than maybe any other vehicle ever ridden

132
00:07:39,699 --> 00:07:41,650
in the city would would you agree it's

133
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:43,570
so much fun it's so much fun

134
00:07:43,570 --> 00:08:13,389
[Music]

135
00:08:13,389 --> 00:08:14,949
one thing you consider though if you

136
00:08:14,949 --> 00:08:17,110
live in a city and you have a bike like

137
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:19,539
this is if you leave it outside it's

138
00:08:19,539 --> 00:08:20,740
going to get stolen so you gotta take it

139
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:24,060
in

140
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:36,880
[Music]

141
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,159
and that's what's required to get this

142
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:42,130
thing into my office uh it's the last

143
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:46,089
question ever so I guess the last it my

144
00:08:46,089 --> 00:08:49,889
overexposed it's just so harsh Oh

145
00:08:49,889 --> 00:08:53,380
perfect perfect perfect dude the big

146
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,759
question Arizona asked is how much of

147
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:56,649
these things and they are right around

148
00:08:56,649 --> 00:08:58,480
two grand they have a couple of

149
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,040
different versions to get but they start

150
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,540
below two grand they go over two grand

151
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,490
that's that's expensive it's a lot of

152
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:04,899
money for an electric bike but if you

153
00:09:04,899 --> 00:09:06,430
start to compare them to other high

154
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:09,459
quality electric bikes it's kind of in

155
00:09:09,459 --> 00:09:10,870
the sweet spot there are certainly bikes

156
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,040
that are more expensive and they're

157
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,680
definitely having low quality bikes that

158
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,899
are less expensive and that's kind of it

159
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:19,149
on the super 73 one thing that I will

160
00:09:19,149 --> 00:09:20,620
say is this company seems you're doing a

161
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:23,500
lot of work with YouTube creators I love

162
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,740
that Sam here has done a video Sam here

163
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:29,230
send it wide Sam here has done a video

164
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:31,269
it's super 73 she was subscribed to Sam

165
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:32,519
by the way you helped me make this video

166
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:34,810
Jesse who else is done Jesse's worked

167
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:37,089
