1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:20,699
a 939 I'm flying to Germany now I did

2
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:22,830
upgrade wasn't that big of a deal I was

3
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,050
able to use miles I was able to upgrade

4
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:33,180
to first class the lounge appears to be

5
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:34,800
broken into three different parts

6
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,469
downstairs is like the regular part of

7
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:39,210
the lounge it looked nice downstairs

8
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,489
this floor here this is like the fancy

9
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:43,230
lounge and they have delicious food but

10
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:46,140
then up here is like the first-class

11
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,510
lounge and it's so fancy up there that I

12
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:50,100
wasn't actually comfortable being up

13
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,690
there it's like super intimate there's a

14
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:53,520
waiter and then I came down here because

15
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,660
this is more my speed

16
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:59,520
this is a food situation here

17
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,320
I had like some chicken and some sort of

18
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,210
steak that it was totally fine totally

19
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,840
good kind of like buffet food and then I

20
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,720
had a decaf cappuccino cappuccino those

21
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,460

25
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:24,090
bar but now I am traveling alone which

26
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:25,890

27
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,780
