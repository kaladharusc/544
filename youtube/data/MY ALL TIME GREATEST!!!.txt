1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
yeah

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,920
yeah

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,670
what

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,269
weird what

5
00:00:13,269 --> 00:00:16,269
maybe didn't like your Invisalign

6
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:22,470
so you think that was just a bad egg I think it was not to be current wave to

7
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:23,420
me

8
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,560
because it's

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,980
like as low crime in it away but then they have to go

10
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,189
you know you just said as a flow prize tonight

11
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:35,280
yeah it's as a crow flies

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:53,150
so flows don't cry candice i'm going to copy at home

13
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:56,470
yeah

14
00:00:56,470 --> 00:01:01,060
- blog as a mission to rescue and recovery mission

15
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:09,020
I'm not someone who likes to set myself up for failure but i do think i need to

16
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,310
be honest here

17
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:14,330
I'm not expecting this to be a successful rescue mission

18
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:17,330
but that's not enough for a reason for me not to try

19
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,900
so I'm gonna give it my best shot

20
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,990
yesterday I left the drone on a rooftop today

21
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:37,470
gonna try and go to reclaim it

22
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:44,010
there are a lot of ways this can play out to gain access to the roof

23
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:48,240
I can try to get to the interior of the buildings climb up one of the Interior

24
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,270
fire escapes gain access that way or

25
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,390
I can try to go into one of these buildings and then just go up inside the

26
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:56,290
building

27
00:01:56,290 --> 00:02:01,450
both have inherent risks both probably count is trespassing right now I'm

28
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:03,370
surveying the block

29
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:11,650
I don't see any clearer means to access the roof

30
00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:27,940
there is a construction site here

31
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:32,960
how you doing

32
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,960
for not judging by the look of that security net

33
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:46,310
I just felt there was a delivery man coming out of this building

34
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:50,210
he's trying to be locked in

35
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:54,330
that's right

36
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,540
I think it's on the roof of this building

37
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,280
I couldn't get any higher than the second floor

38
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,230
no that's the wrong building

39
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:21,230
for this building

40
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,880
that's the rooftop it's right there

41
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:38,810
there's a hardware store over here maybe I can sneak out through the back of the

42
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:44,630
hardware store they do they don't have roof access from here

43
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:47,630
swimming in the right building

44
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:52,580
there she is

45
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:55,580
the drone is still there

46
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:07,010
the drone is still on the rooftop I can see it just behind me

47
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:11,849
I can also see there's no way I'm getting on that route

48
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:14,909
it's all residential buildings they're all highly secure

49
00:04:14,909 --> 00:04:18,299
I can't go to an adjacent building climb over there is no access

50
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,079
I need an entirely new approach

51
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:35,389
ok

52
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,540
the wildly different approach this is a high-risk recovery attempt

53
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,100
but I don't know what other options are left

54
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,100
I've got 900 feet of industrial twine

55
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:41,360
at the end of that 90 feet of twine I got this grappling hook shaped out of

56
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,400
baling wire now I can see the corner few things that could go wrong in this

57
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,360
scenario but the one that I'm most worried about is after i hook it and I'm

58
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:55,099
pulling it up to 300 feet if and when it falls

59
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,340
that's good night that is lights out that's doom

60
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,780
right see how this goes

61
00:06:11,289 --> 00:06:21,520
lowering the grappling hook

62
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:45,200
okay we've got contact

63
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,660
it is much further down that expected

64
00:06:56,190 --> 00:07:09,270
close close

65
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,930
we're gonna swing it out swing it out come on

66
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,630
very close

67
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:34,490
i touch the blade

68
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:40,220
and trap

69
00:07:50,090 --> 00:08:00,949
i think i got it i think i've got it

70
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:13,120
yeah

71
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:23,660
don't touch the building don't have the building

72
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:30,620
got another hundred hundred twenty feet to go

73
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:34,100
come on you're almost home

74
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:39,290
nice easy i can see the drone I could see the drone

75
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:46,870
so close

76
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:53,200
it's right there

77
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:09,579
I got it I got it

78
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,970
that is mission accomplished
