3
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:08,139
the back right now and that's because I

decided to make a business purchase

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,240
because you really can't have idubbbz TV

without our brand spanking new Samsung

7
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,820
Smart TV it's really gonna increase the

8
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,220
production value of the show here's one

9
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:22,900
example of how it could increase the

10
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,699
production value Oh what do you know one

11
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:26,350

opportunities to watch great videos like

17
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:46,809

00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:55,780
excited about this cuz we got a shit ton

23
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:57,730
a fan mail it's been saved up for like

24
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:59,890
two weeks our first package comes from

25
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:03,100
China from a fella named Mike hey Mike

26
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,170
from China I'm gonna start to be very

27
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:07,119
careful with these packages because I do

28
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,090
not fucking want like me doing a money

29
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:12,729
shot and then spring-loaded shit comes

30
00:01:12,729 --> 00:01:14,920
out I don't want like someone to like

31
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,290
create a booby trap in such a way that

32
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:19,720
my rooms covered in hepatitis C I would

33
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,090
prefer if that didn't happen this so far

34
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:27,790
isn't bad oh my god if you guys are new

35
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:30,189
to my channel there's a Kickstarter

36
00:01:30,189 --> 00:01:31,750
project that I looked at in the past

37
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:34,119
where this guy just wanted to kickstart

38
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:36,700
an emoji imma be all the planes and

39
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:37,420
turds

40
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:39,189
he wanted to kickstart emoji and the

41
00:01:39,189 --> 00:01:41,380
emoji was this one that's that's right

42
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,380
on the thing and it's called I'm a bee

43
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,600
so like it would be shorthand for imma

44
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,030
be at your place tomorrow at 5 imma be

45
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:51,270
Netflix and chilling for a little while

46
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,829
after I go to the ballgame this next

47
00:01:53,829 --> 00:01:55,210
package continues the trend of

48
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:57,700
addressing it to een dupes the rest of

49
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,829
these are dressed up even more fucking

50
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:04,210

57
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:14,830
concerned

58
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,840
about wasting taxpayer money if you were

bunch of condoms delivered in my house

63
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,040
waste of taxpayer money because I didn't

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,690

00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,900
one I'm not so sure about some of this

105
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,459
stuff because a lot of it looks like it

106
00:03:57,459 --> 00:04:02,410
could be I don't know self promoting

107

fight crime abort black babies I am

110
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:14,500
certainly not the PC police here on

111
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,090
YouTube I'll say my fair share of

112
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:18,220
questionable shit it doesn't really give

113
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,410
me much to work with I'm not going to

114
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:23,590
hold up the nigger owner's manual and

117
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,560
nigger word let's laugh out loud in the

118
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,050
comments you guys it's what I would deem

119
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:35,690
a try-hard effort this is the second to

120
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:37,310
last package and it's addressed to Ian

121
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,530
Dingle dick and it's from Nathan alright

122
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:43,100
for starters we got the Quran a nice

123
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,780
little dichotomy here on the show

124
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,790
don't send tissue paper or paper towels

125
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:49,700
as packing supply because it honestly

126
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,380
just makes me really fucking nervous

127
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,000
that it's toilet paper covered in shit

128
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,490
Corpus Christi a feast for crows

129
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,630
normally I would be very scared to put

130
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,950
on someone else's beanie for fear of

131
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:01,880
lice however I got no hair this is uh

132
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,010
what I like to call an epic win it

133
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:06,380
covers around your eyes so my no

134
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:09,320

137
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,560
pretty fucking cool wow this guy's

138
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,180
setting me up to be a fucking terrorist

139
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,010
or something all right what else we got

140
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:24,290
clothes pin the Quran shut these

141
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,570
respective dupes last but not least we

142
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:36,590
have a Shrek 2 donkey and Shrek this one

143
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:38,660
is from Lois and it's addressed to Ian

144
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:41,270
Ian spelled I I am I'm smelling cologne

145
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,340
or perfume all over this thing and I'm

146
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,590
pretty fucking sure it's like a ploy

147
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:46,850
because it's filled with something

148
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:49,430
cancerous all right I think we found the

149
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:56,200
culprit why does it have so much perfume

150
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,190
well at least I now have an explanation

151
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,740

00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:30,470
a bang I would just slit open this bag

166
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:32,210
of ladybugs and have them escape

167
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:34,220
throughout my room but I'm now thinking

168
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,720
that that would probably be very

169
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,370
anticlimactic because I don't think

170
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,380
they're going to just start flying

171
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,070
everywhere

172
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,660
it won't come across very

173
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,630
on the camera so instead of doing that

174
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,650
we're gonna do a little bit of a bonfire

175
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:55,640
ah hell yeah

176
00:06:55,640 --> 00:07:04,020

183
