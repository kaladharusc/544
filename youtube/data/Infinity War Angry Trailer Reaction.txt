cap

11
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,429
let's talk about this plan ears I think

12
00:01:09,429 --> 00:01:22,640
it's good except it sucks your plans are

13
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:28,710
Hulkbuster

14
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,900
for lightning

15
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:44,060
there you go

16
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:48,740
what no no humanity will exist he wants

17
00:01:48,740 --> 00:02:02,909
to destroy everything

18
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:09,000
oh man it's a free-for-all do you gotta

19
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,420
do what you gotta do to win I am very

20
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:28,590
excited oh shit copyright

21
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:32,020
cuz I agate tickets now five hours ago

22
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,910
they're already fucking sold out and we

23
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,440
got shit

24
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,450
yeah we've managed to get ours it had

25
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:40,300
like fucking midnight and something that

26
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,890
was a trailer very gratifying satisfying

27
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:46,840
looks to be freaking awesome no problems

28
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,280
there you know I guess I mean I don't

29
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,450
know Marvel doesn't make some of the

30
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:55,780
same mistakes that DC does so it looks

31
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,310
like they're gonna bring it this is the

32
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:02,290
culmination of Fela eighteen films or

33
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:04,660
something like that in 20 years I guess

34
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,310
I don't know how many years but it's

35
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:10,450
been a long time and I don't know if it

36
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:13,959
can live up to that level of hype but

37
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:17,230
you know we're hoping that it can its

38
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:21,519
kind of beyond it's a lot of people that

39
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:22,330
they're only one movie

40
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:24,400
yeah it's beyond the realm of

41
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,170
possibility so already you're gonna have

42
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,880
me but all those guys not in it enough

43
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,830
and they didn't develop the characters

44
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:31,810
and yeah I get already everybody's

45
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,790
already well developed they did a good

46
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:36,400
part on that it's gonna be a different

47
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,980
kind of film than we've ever seen before

48
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:41,200
or maybe it's gonna be formulaic this is

49
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,489
gonna be a storyline that we're gonna

50
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:45,340
have to see but because there's so many

51
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,530
characters are they gonna focus on a

52
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:50,230
small few and then it's a cameos or are

53
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,180
they gonna try to split the screen time

54
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:55,090
between everybody who can kind of hold

55
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:57,370
camp I kind of hope they do a little bit

56
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:02,799
more with Chris Pratt and Robert they're

57
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,959
both very charismatic and charming I

58
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,359
wanted to see them did their little

59
00:04:07,359 --> 00:04:10,269
banter they'll be pretty fun so Tom

60
00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:11,890
Holland is if you look at his face in

61
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,840
the trailer it looks weird like it looks

62
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,109
like he's CG the entire time like at the

63
00:04:17,109 --> 00:04:18,310
very end was one where he's talking

64
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:20,289
about Doctor Strange this suit and then

65
00:04:20,289 --> 00:04:22,180
there was another one like midway

66
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,700
through mm-hmm when I watch this the

67
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,660
first time I was like what's wrong with

68
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:28,060
his face like did they not you know is

69
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,680
that not really him or what do they do

70
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,630
yeah no I'm sure that they're well no I

71
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:35,919
was gonna say they're still working on

72
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,599
CGI but no they pushed this movie up

73
00:04:37,599 --> 00:04:39,909
which means that they are so confident

74
00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:40,540
in

75
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,480
and being done and ready that they want

76
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,600
people to see it even earlier so Doctor

77
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,150
Strange it plays a huge factor in the

78
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,370
comic book storyline we've done previous

79
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:53,110
videos on it so you can go back and

80
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,520
watch our previous mom I don't know

81
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,020
which one forget it just don't do it

82
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:59,290
but it plays a huge factor so hopefully

83
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:01,120
he's gonna be doing that here but I

84
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,420
think that I think at this point I can

85
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,740
safely say it's gonna be completely

86
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,050
different from the comics and that sucks

87
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,970
because the comics I think is what they

88
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:12,070
needed to adapt they needed to go that

89
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:16,300
big that destructive that holy fucking

90
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,610
shit and I don't think they're gonna do

91
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,800
that because it's Disney you know

92
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,960
basically okay I'll spoil it for you is

93
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,320
everybody dies okay Beto's wins I don't

94
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,730
think they're gonna do that here now

95
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:30,460
originally this was a two-parter now

96
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,780
they've sort of split it and said

97
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,490
infinity war and then they'll call the

98
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:36,400
next one something else right so they

99
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,260
still have the possibility of doing that

100
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,060
and I don't know how many plot details

101
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,400
have leaked it's to see if people even

102
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,260
know if that's gonna be the case but I'm

103
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,400
sure doesn't he doesn't want kids

104
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,260
running out of the theater crying and

105
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,750
shit like that but I want them I want

106
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,000
this couple just kill off a couple get a

107
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,530
couple you want you want a couple dead

108
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:56,680
yeah what's the kill count that you will

109
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:01,530
feel that Thanos was a baddie before

110
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:03,940
main care you know whatever lay man came

111
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,520
yeah man yeah you want four yes four of

112
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:10,660
the roster of what now 14 10 named

113
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:13,620
characters 10 you want 10 maybe god

114
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,580
there's a lot of there's a lot of like

115
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,110
like secondary characters we know the

116
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,060
names of right that are you know we

117
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,290
don't really care all that much pepper

118
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:25,330
we have no I don't know like a baby hmm

119
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:27,280
they're all named yeah no like if he

120
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,140
kills 10 named people I think that'll be

121
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,480
enough okay well that's a lot higher

122
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,640
than job or I think it's gonna be closer

123
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:37,390
to like 2 or 3 when I want it me I want

124
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:42,150
everyone day okay no and I guarantee

125
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:44,740
well what about what I want is them all

126
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,420
to die in the film and then maybe at the

127
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,130
end doctor straight lay people wake up

128
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:50,230
and Doctor Strange has them in a pocket

129
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:52,960
dimension or something I don't fucking

130
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,889
know Oh

131
00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:55,900
I don't know that's like that but then

132
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,080
you know they're like we have even

133
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,780
better is they're all dead and then they

134
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,789
all show up at the same time and then

135
00:07:03,789 --> 00:07:06,460
this hooded figure turns around and she

136
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,289
pulls her hood down and it's fucking

137
00:07:08,289 --> 00:07:10,360
death and she's like welcome and then

138
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,939
the the film ends so it's almost like a

139
00:07:12,939 --> 00:07:14,860
new journey you know it's like welcome

140
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,449
to death I don't think they're gonna do

141
00:07:16,449 --> 00:07:17,889
the course that's pretty far-fetched

142
00:07:17,889 --> 00:07:20,319
cool but you know that was cool right

143
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,629
what I just said I make the best movies

144
00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:25,060
you ain't never seen but it ain't about

145
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,580
what movie I I can make it's about what

146
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,069
movie that is made here I will it

147
00:07:30,069 --> 00:07:32,590
satisfy will it gratify with no debts I

148
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:33,759
think it's gonna be a huge

149
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,310
disappointment if no characters die that

150
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:39,340
that's just that's just my thing and and

151
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:42,009
and with an incredible opportunity like

152
00:07:42,009 --> 00:07:47,080
this over 20 years and 17 films 18 let

153
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,469
go hard you gotta go hard so don't mess

154
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:52,180

155
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,370

156

159
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,370
hope these warrior when war look great

160
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:08,729
that reminds me of that one girl

161
00:08:08,729 --> 00:08:11,860
golly what was that she was with Arnold

162
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,800
Schwarzenegger out like was that Conan

163
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,490
Red Sonja no nevermind but this this is

164
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:20,860
looking great of course I can't wait to

165
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:23,139
see the Guardians at the galaxy they're

166
00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:26,379
my favorite crew I love this is gonna be

167
00:08:26,379 --> 00:08:29,169
pretty cool that's gonna be fun the

168
00:08:29,169 --> 00:08:33,039
sarcastic answer and his face looks

169
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,349
weird no it doesn't his face actually

170
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:36,789
looks fine I don't know what you're

171
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:38,199
talking about I thought maybe you were

172
00:08:38,199 --> 00:08:39,610
talking about his face where it's like

173
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:41,050
the outline you could tell that there oh

174
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:43,690
no I know that hard this face looks

175
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,390
great what it is I think is that

176
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:49,149
everybody has orange themselves you know

177
00:08:49,149 --> 00:08:51,070
in the makeup department and when you

178
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:52,660
see it on a little kid like this you're

179
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,399
like wait a minute looks like it's been

180
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,829
touched up with CG it no it just looks

181
00:08:56,829 --> 00:08:59,589
like he's he's too old tan there's no CG

182
00:08:59,589 --> 00:09:03,790
there yeah so that's looking great so

183
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:07,000
what do we have here we've got

184
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,210
though the warriors the Avenger warriors

185
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:12,310
flying out towards we got what is that

186
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:15,730
I'm war machine Falcon who you think is

187
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:19,780
gonna die and I guess they're heading

188
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,640
towards the threat which is attacking

189
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,010
Wakanda there seems to be like land

190
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:26,800
sharks moving towards them maybe I don't

191
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,930
street sharks that'd be freaking sweet

192
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:34,570
okay we've got Black Widow hopefully she

193
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:36,640
gets her own film I'll watch it even if

194
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,880
it goes direct to video I think Bucky is

195
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,400
yeah behind her the hope buster he's

196
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,440
gonna take out quite a few before he

197
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,120
goes down so it looks like it's gonna be

198
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,270
a holding action on Wakanda while

199
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:52,540
several main characters go for a main

200
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,940
objective is what I'm seeing here and

201
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,860
then Thor showing off his new

202
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:59,470
electricity powers these I think are the

203
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:01,660
ships that we saw approaching Wakanda

204
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:05,350
this looks very odd I have no idea where

205
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:08,080
this is this doesn't look like Earth or

206
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,210
maybe it does what the is this

207
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,920
it could be sand or it could be it could

208
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,540
be what part of Wakanda we didn't see I

209
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:16,810
mean we only saw one so by FISH but

210
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:19,180
that's taro from DC you know what I'm

211
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,890
saying it kind of looks like a starfish

212
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:23,020
but that would be a different franchise

213
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:25,990
which I hope we do see star oh oh no no

214
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,790
that doesn't maybe that's not that's a

215
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:30,400
portal it's only that's right that's

216
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,920
what Thor breaks door breaks the portal

217
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,480
I think and then they're like oh we're

218
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,830
safe and then they're like no you're not

219
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:36,450
I'm here anyway

220
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:37,840
[Laughter]

221
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,940
so he looks pretty tight I'm glad that

222
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,410
they I see the helmet look I thought

223
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:43,780
they were gonna try to you know go with

224
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:46,000
all-out all that stuff so my main

225
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,430
complaint taken care of what is going

226
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:50,260
what's good more action yeah I was gonna

227
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,430
say is like that's a little flashback

228
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:55,300
okay nice y'all you called it cuz I was

229
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,460
like wait she betrays us and why is she

230
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,980
a midget all of it said he's huge why

231
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:02,110
did she get short all of a sudden but no

232
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:08,890
it's he is he fucks up for okay there's

233
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:10,420
no doubt about that

234
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:15,040
but he Thor Eggen dicey hey who is this

235
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,760
over here

236
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,670
these are the villains yeah so this is

237
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:19,690
the part where

238
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:22,270
we speculated that these are all

239
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:24,130
Asgardians they look fucking here brings

240
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:26,710
from the key and when when Thanos

241
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:29,920
captures the ship and he brings them a

242
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,250
cube for freedom so here I was wondering

243
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,380
about the side characters we've got a

244
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:38,490
lady some health dude this guy with

245
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:41,020
maybe that it looks like he's fighting

246
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:43,330
and Doctor Strange later so he's

247
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:45,630
probably the sorcerer guy sorcery dude

248
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:47,260
big bruiser

249
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:50,050
and that's when he gives him yep so

250
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:51,490
they're telling you right in the trailer

251
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:53,050
what's happening so it must be pretty

252
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:56,140
inconsequential well it's one of the

253
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,580
gems so it's not that inconsequential

254
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:00,490
yeah okay so you got all of Wakanda

255
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:02,530
rally together all of the tribes oh he's

256
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:11,260
got a new arm yeah oh yeah yeah this is

257
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,580
what I wanted to see I was like how are

258
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,580
they gonna do this big Braveheart battle

259
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:17,650
but they found a way man they said just

260
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:20,050
Wakanda you know fuck the US military

261
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:22,300
but fuck all the other militaries you

262
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,220
gotta explain that you know is it just

263
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,140
what conda's military well he's probably

264
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,580
checking the strongest place on earth

265
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,530
which is probably what car died due to

266
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:32,080
their technology your eye so then I I

267
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:37,110
guess these are aliens that come with

268
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:41,410
Thor or not door but Thanos this is

269
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:51,480
jacked up is whew hey that's a good way

270
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:55,900
yeah oh man this is gonna be great boy

271
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,290
we got lots of battles and and then

272
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:01,180
there's gonna be three hours I'm hoping

273
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:06,190
I wanna but by this finger man do

274
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:08,770

276
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:19,930
36 man one more add 15 minutes more 30

277
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:21,180
minutes okay

00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:24,670
three hours six hours all right so

279
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,560
that's our opinion on the infinity war

280
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,990
trailer great let's know how excited you

283
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:40,930
Spidey thing through all the destruction

284
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:45,760
oh alright check it out and drop a

285
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,370
comment in the section below see you

286
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,779
guys on the next in gradua

287
00:13:49,779 --> 00:13:54,040
bye guys alright alright what do you

288
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,690
think uh what do you think it's gonna be

289
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:58,959
what I mean like badass or stupid

290
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,709
oh it's gonna be fucking badass good I

291
00:14:01,709 --> 00:14:04,269
think they've learned they hopefully

292
00:14:04,269 --> 00:14:06,100
learned from Justice League's mistakes

293
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,810
and they make a better ensemble movie

294
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:09,940
well they have already been doing that

295
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:12,370
but I think I think it's gonna be badass

296
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:14,410
however I do think that it will be

297
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:16,690
disappointing for comic book fans and

298
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,310
well I mean that's like Civil War was

299
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:19,959
one of the biggest letdowns ever it's

300
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:22,390
like why even call it civil war it's

301
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:24,519
still fine film but it wasn't the comics

302
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:27,550
but yeah but it was a fantastic film and

303
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,630
I think it's something similar this will

304
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:30,250
be a fantastic film but it won't be the

305
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,620
same thing with Thor Thor it'll be a

306
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:35,709
Hollywood version which it is alright

307
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:37,600
