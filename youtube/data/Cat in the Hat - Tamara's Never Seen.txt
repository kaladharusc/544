00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,340
hi everyone my name is Tamara chambers

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:04,890
and this is Tamara's never seen and

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:07,980
today I am watching Cat in the Hat this

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,950
is the first week of November where I

5
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:14,040
watched terrible terrible films and I'm

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,830
starting it off with just a my classic

7
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,800
what a what a classic I don't want to

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,140
watch last week was technically in

9
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,630
November although I was still calling it

10
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,279
Tam Tober fest but it was the human

11
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:29,130
centipede so it could also fit right in

12
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,019
there I've heard from the nostalgia

13
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:32,730
critic guys that this is just terrible

14
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:36,329
Wilson Wilson let's see if it's that bad

15
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:39,420
I think it will be I like Mike Myers

16
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,370
though so I don't know there should be

17
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:46,910
some comedy there I like Dakota Fanning

18
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:52,079
third example Oh God okay let's just do

19
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,560
it you know I mean all right

20
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:09,100
[Music]

21
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,380
well that was a pit of sadness that I

22
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,870
will never recover from

23
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:17,170
there was no laughter there was just cat

24
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:21,160
there were no smiles to be had there was

25
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:26,369
just hat there was no joy there was only

26
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:32,229
Mike Myers being terrible well how are

27
00:01:32,229 --> 00:01:34,930
you so bad in a film and then so good

28
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:47,770
and so many other things what what I was

29
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:50,950
texting Doug and Rob Walker about my

30
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,869
movie-watching experience with this and

31
00:01:52,869 --> 00:01:55,420
I said I didn't even smile let alone

32
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,520
laugh there was no joy to be found in

33
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:04,180
this movie end quote by Tamra chambers I

34
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,950
think this is one of the worst films

35
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:06,880
I've ever seen

36
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,880
the lack of comedy was insane the lack

37
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,540
of fun was insane literally not once did

38
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,940
I smile from something just like vaguely

39
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:20,260
making me happy it was so so so so so so

40
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:23,799
bad oh how did they make it that bad

41
00:02:23,799 --> 00:02:25,810
when the source material is so good and

42
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:31,989
Edwin oh stop laughing at yourself I do

43
00:02:31,989 --> 00:02:34,209
this all the time in my cameras they

44
00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:35,950
receive episodes all like say something

45
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,660
and then I'll laugh and one of editing

46
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,040
back I'm like wow you really laugh at

47
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,120

48
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,269
Meyers as cats stop laughing at yourself

49
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:50,769
here's a dumb joke that I just thought

50
00:02:50,769 --> 00:02:52,630
of this morning that pooped on it and

51
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,860
then put it in a script

52
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:56,739
oh we're gonna carve out a section of

53
00:02:56,739 --> 00:02:59,290
this deposit you know what I mean the

54
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:03,040
sets were cool and the stylization of

55
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,049
the film was really cool the costumes

56
00:03:05,049 --> 00:03:08,680
and it all looked very cool very Grinchy

57
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,590
I guess very you know how cat mat should

58
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:14,079
look it looks super cool I loved it I

59
00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:15,070
loved it

60
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,780
it started off before cat showed up

61
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:21,060
everything was fine in my note so I was

62
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,880
like oh it's just jack and then I wrote

63
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,110
Oh No

64
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:28,410
Oh Jack no hard to make him not funny I

65
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:31,380

00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:34,010

69
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:48,240

72
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:57,780
Alec Baldwin weasel his way into what is

73
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,270
happening so the story is about this

74
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:02,400
single mother who's dating Alec Baldwin

75
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,320
and she has two children the children

76
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,610

77
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:08,850
she's going to get fired if the party

78
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:11,040
she's throwing tonight for her job is it

79
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,720

83
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,660
house and it's like about getting the

84
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,480

85
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,770
capturing their dog that ran away it's a

86
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:28,740
mess of a story it's terrible but Alec

87
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,140
Baldwin's character wants the son of the

88
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,630
mother to go to military school because

89
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,550
he's a little brat and he makes a mess

90
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,350
of everything and he's very immature he

91
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,820
does the opposite of what everyone tells

92
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,860
him to do great cool cool cool

93
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,570
we're supposed to be like pitted against

94
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:45,060
Alec Baldwin's character and this which

95
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,490
let's be honest isn't hard to do but

96
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,740
it's so funny because he's like I you

97
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:50,820
should go to military school and

98
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:54,120
everyone's like wow that's crazy and I'm

99
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,430
like yeah that's one rat regardless if

100
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,710
it's the mom instead of having a fight

101
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:01,110
at one point and the son goes sometimes

102
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,910
I wish I had a different mom and the mom

103
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:05,370
fires back yeah well sometimes I wish

104
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:10,620
the same thing whoa brutal son fire

105
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:17,310
shots just flying everywhere damn shit I

106
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:19,410
wrote this is really cute so far I think

107
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:21,479
it might be Mike Meyers that makes this

108
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:24,020
movie bad so far it's good

109
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:28,659
[Laughter]

110
00:05:28,659 --> 00:05:33,439
then he comes in dad what the nothing

111
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:34,490
about him is funny

112
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:37,430
his physical humor not funny his jokes

113
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:39,590
not funny the way he's delivering the

114
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:42,319
lines not funny the makeup atrocious

115
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:46,849

117
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:50,719
doing

118
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:54,289
oh he coughed up a hairball that's

119
00:05:54,289 --> 00:05:56,360
hilarious actually right before I

120
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,659
started filming this mic at Wendy's in

121
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:01,460
fact did cough up a hairball and it

122
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,020
wasn't funny and it was just it was

123
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,759
funnier than the movie should have cast

124
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:07,279
Wendy she's internet famous for eating

125
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:07,909
pancakes

126
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:12,680
so she there's a big musical number when

127
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,330
he enters and it's all about having fun

128
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:17,360
the song is about having fun and I

129
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,479
browned through the whole thing I was it

130
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,999
actively angered me to watch this

131
00:06:22,999 --> 00:06:27,409
musical number of a giant talking cat

132
00:06:27,409 --> 00:06:30,439
about having fun the I it's very own

133
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:32,210
brand for me to like something like that

134
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:34,879
and I surround through the entire thing

135
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:39,199
you guys so many fart and poop and burp

136
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,300
jokes throughout all of this you know I

137
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,379
would actually like to formally

138
00:06:42,379 --> 00:06:45,110

00:06:51,289 --> 00:06:54,319
happen again for the bottom of my heart

142
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,939
I'm sorry just wrote I wish this were

143
00:06:55,939 --> 00:06:58,279

145
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:03,810
they're not funny in big letters ever

146
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:07,020
nothing is funny anymore help and the

147
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:15,900
fish is the best actor the CGI fish the

148
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,060
best actor then he's a pinata for some

149
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,650
reason they're like hide and then he

150
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:21,630
sees that there's a giant cat pinata

151
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:27,900
eggs like you know what it's weirdly

152
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,060
sexual too like yeah they're doing a

153
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:33,030
bunch of like adult jokes adult humor in

154
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,590
this that's not what I mean I mean like

155
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:39,120
having this bigger adult size man cat

156
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,520
walking around with these kids and like

157
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,900
having kids hit him in the crotch

158
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,540
that's a pinata like stuff like it's

159
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:49,320
just it's it's very weirdly on the verge

160
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,660
of being sexual I'm probably just

161
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,729
looking too deep into it because I was

162
00:07:53,729 --> 00:07:54,870
sitting there just trying to find

163
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:56,610
anything to talk about

164
00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:00,510
during this stupid movie every joke is

165
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:04,560
misery that's a fun one that I wrote fun

166
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,630
line you know how to tell when a movie

167
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:10,020
is bad it's when Paris Hilton shows up

168
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,720
and you're like oh okay

169
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,919
there's something of note I just

170
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,570
suddenly in the middle of watching this

171
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:17,460
film had a brilliant idea that I had to

172
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,979
write down and it's just four words I

173
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:23,039
can dip hats Wow you know what it'll

174
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,889
bring joy to some viewers after a

175
00:08:24,889 --> 00:08:28,830
10-minute misery review is um I can

176
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:34,140
different different pasts

177
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:37,150
what was that Universal Studios call

178
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,740
what was that

179
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,270
they're on a roller coaster and the Sun

180
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,740
is like this is like a roller coaster

181
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:44,470
and he's like just like the ones that

182
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:46,330
Universal Studios and he pulls out two

183
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:49,320
tickets to Universal Studios what

184
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,660
surprised myself a little with how angry

185
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,730
I wrote it's almost impossible how

186
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:57,880
shitty it is it's almost impossible but

187
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:02,740
they did it okay so Rob Walker says

188
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:05,110
Myers wanted out and the studio held him

189
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:07,390
to the contract game rumor is he made it

190
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,800
extra awful just to bring the project

191
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,260
down he trolled it and won it was

192
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,660
miserable I hope that's the case

193
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:16,330
that makes it better in my mind's

194
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:18,340
because I really like Mike Myers and I

195
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,950
did not really like this I I hated this

196
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:24,000
