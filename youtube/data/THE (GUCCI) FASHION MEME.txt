1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:07,660
Fashion! It's something that genuinely interests me, and.. confuses me at the same time.

2
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:12,140
Maybe you feel the same way. Maybe you don't care. OK, great.

3
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:16,040
OK, so you're telling me, this is not confusing to you?

4
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,540
*Laughs*

5
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:22,100
You're telling me this? This GUCCI face mask isn't confusing to you?

6
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,160
Can you imagine wearing this while robbing the bank?

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,220
&quot;Hand over all  your money??&quot;,  &quot;But you already have so much money!&quot; &quot;You goddamn right I do!

8
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:29,240
*laughs*

9
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,240
Something i have noticed lately and maybe you have is well

10
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,390
It's been going for a while

11
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:38,790
fashion and memes are becoming more and
more intertwined. Gucci is the prime

12
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:44,190
example of memes and fashion coming
together. A few years ago they even did a

13
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:49,140
campaign purely based around memes to
sell their watch, and you know what it

14
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:54,460
was actually pretty good. &quot;when he buys
you flowers instead of a GUCCI watch

15
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:55,420
Relatable!

16
00:00:55,420 --> 00:01:03,120
&quot;buy milk, call mom, wash car, new
watch, that's the thing it actually worked

17
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,480
worked they actually pulled it off
pretty well I have to say. I think that's

18
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,710
really interesting because a lot of
brands try to use memes in their

19
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:16,650
marketing as a way to appeal to a
broader audience but it rarely works.

20
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:22,200
We have so many cringe-worthy examples of
this is failing completely like Xfinity

21
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:29,520
have their... the Memestiens! &quot;XFinity
presents the Memestiens&quot; &quot;I don't like

22
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:36,310
where this is going&quot; Xfinity is crazy fast!&quot;
&quot;almost as me NOOB!&quot;

23
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:40,880
&quot;you don't know what you're doing here&quot;
and of course the classic eating spicy

24
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:49,010
goodness LIKE A BOSS &quot;eats spicy goodness LIKE A BOSS!&quot; Yikes!

25
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:52,460
but probably one of the reasons why
Gucci was able to pull it off is because

26
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:57,740
memes and fashion make sense in a way
although I'll be lying if I said it didn't confuse me.

27
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:02,119
this is the first piece of clothing that shows up if you go to

28
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:08,270
GUCCI's website, GUCCI has really been
the forefront of the meve...meme movement

29
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:14,390
maybe that's not true actually but
they're one of the bigger ones. Like what is this? they're just clearly just taking the piss!

30
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:19,520
they have to be. The fall and winter
hey you want a dress like this one only

31
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,970
a couple grand and you can look like
this. It almost feels like a social

32
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:27,170
experiment of getting all these models
in and being like &quot;can we trick these

33
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:32,060
models into thinking they're actually
showing off our clothes&quot; anyhow if you

34
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:38,450
look at GUCCI maybe ten years ago you
get very different type of looks it's

35
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:43,850
very plain it's very simple it's very
clean very cut and dry their brand

36
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:50,690
represents very much how memes work it's
loud it's colorful it's obnoxious

37
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:56,090
it doesn't take itself seriously you
know what used to be a parody is now

38
00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:00,510
wri... becoming reality in a way
and other brands have embraced this

39
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:06,150
fashion meme pretty literally you have
Vetements another great brand that I like

40
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:11,340
they had this famous raincoat where they
wrote literally the definition of a meme

41
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:16,409
at the back of it and their clothing
really represent the whole idea of loud

42
00:03:16,409 --> 00:03:22,280
not too serious this guy literally
even looks like me what is this. *Laughs*

43
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:27,900
I thought it was so cool and so different
for having the goofy glasses when I

44
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:34,220
displayed my merch well turns out it
alter reality PewDiePie already exists

45
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:38,040
excuse me lady I think those pants are a
little too big

46
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:43,820
another another brand that embraces the
meme is Balenclaga you probably seen

47
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:52,860
these look at this dude! okay I ironicly like this one how much is it 1,500 (agh!)

48
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:58,170
Balenclaga (Igah?) which has the famous sneakers
the triple-s which are this these

49
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:03,389
gigantic colorful sneakers I remember
when I was in Japan all the.. all the

50
00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:08,370
Japanese kids had these shoes, these $800
sneakers and I was so confused by it I'm

51
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:15,000
like &quot;how did all these kids afford these
items? there's no way!&quot; &quot;I think whoever

52
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,440
designed these was just like how much
can we (blah) with sneaker heads and make

53
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:25,620
the worst shoe ever made that they still
will probably buy&quot; cmon! I think I think

54
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:30,780
the black ones are..are pretty cool...no? alright. You probably don't care that this

55
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:34,500
is so random for me to talk about but I
do think it's very interesting how these

56
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:40,199
these brands have embraced this
different look on fashion completely and

57
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:46,169
you have these classic brands like GUCCI
and Louis Vuitton that used to be very clean

58
00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:52,530
very simple only high-class people
really buy these items because they're

59
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:56,639
the only ones that can afford it and
have any reasons to buy it but now since

60
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,620
people want to buy into that feeling
of feel.. of being very luxurious

61
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:04,530
they don't just want to buy that but
they also want to display that you know

62
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:09,030
people people are just gonna buy an
expensive item they clearly want other

63
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:13,650
people to know that it's an expensive item
you wouldn't know that this is all

64
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:22,030
Louis Vuitton while it's pretty clear on this
outfit *Laughs* clothing really is such a huge

65
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:26,620
part of our language uhh.. the expression
is &quot;you are what you eat&quot; but it really

66
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:30,580
should be &quot;you are what you consume&quot; you
know obviously people want to associate

67
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:35,139
with these luxury brands and it's become
so popular especially with Soundcloud

68
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:39,370
rappers which are practically memes
themselves you know colorful, loud,

69
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:45,909
obnoxious, this exact same thing, uh Lil
Pump embracing GUCCI GUCCI gang even

70
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:50,320
tattooing it on himself  that's how hard
they want to be part of this brand

71
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:57,190
Savage 21 with Saint Laurent, Takeshi 6ix9ine
it's all the same thing. When me and

72
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,700
Marzia were in Japan we stayed there for
a month and we lived in the fashion

73
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:06,130
district so we were constantly
surrounded by people very often wearing

74
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:10,569
the exact same type of clothes or the
same brands at least I felt like I had

75
00:06:10,569 --> 00:06:15,280
to buy the same type of brands because I
wanted to belong you get that feeling of

76
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,080
you want to be part of the group and I
think that's largely why so many kids

77
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:25,210
now are just buying into this hype beats
meme because people want to feel like

78
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:28,870
they belong they're part of it. Which
there's nothing wrong with of course I'm

79
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:33,250
not judging that I just find the
interesting of men's fashion especially

80
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:38,380
had just takes such a massive shift
because of it because usually high-class

81
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:44,430
clothing used to be so preppy but now
luxury items is available for anyone to

82
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:50,139
wear even if you're not into that type
of style they with the hypebeast it's

83
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:55,870
really more about a sporty type of look
so you can wear expensive items while

84
00:06:55,870 --> 00:07:00,460
still not feeling like you're too far
off from yourself this is just me

85
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:05,080
speculating there's no hard facts here
but I think that's why hype beast has

86
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:09,909
become so popular all the kids want to
show that yes I have money when in

87
00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:12,969
reality they're probably just spending
whatever money they have on these

88
00:07:12,969 --> 00:07:17,520
expensive items or
asking their parents to buy it just so they can

89
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,270
feel like they're part of the group. I'm
not an exempt from it I feel the same

90
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:24,990
way, like I said when I was in Japan I
really was like &quot;oh I want to buy this

91
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:30,179
because everyone else has it&quot; you know
uh it's hard to ignore it even if you are

92
00:07:30,179 --> 00:07:34,409
aware of it
supreme is such a brand example because

93
00:07:34,409 --> 00:07:38,099
usually they're famous for just
literally slapping the logo on it's like

94
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:43,320
yes hello I am wearing supreme as well
how do you do and that's the thing about

95
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:48,960
memes as well that really relates to
fashion because memes is being part of a

96
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:54,240
group as well it's part of being a joke
group &quot;hah, look we understand the same

97
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,499
joke&quot; that's why memes are so obscure so
that you feel like &quot;oh I get it

98
00:07:58,499 --> 00:08:05,700
other people probably don't get it but I
get it so I I belong in this joke group&quot;

99
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:09,569
I wonder if I could get away with
charging hundred sixty pounds for a

100
00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:14,400
sweater. People were so mad at me and
Marzia for is a completely signed up our

101
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,389
hoodie for a hundred dollars which is
ethically produce as well which means it

102
00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:22,979
cost more and and the margin that we put
on it is super fair but people got so

103
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:28,289
angry meanwhile let me just buy the
supreme like how these turtleneck with

104
00:08:28,289 --> 00:08:35,550
the logo on this side are becoming more
popular now as well hmm...*Laughs* what confuses me

105
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:42,779
the absolute most about this fashion meme
movement is: who buys the stuff? Who is

106
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:46,949
buying these things like the shoes okay
alright they're crazy but they're kind

107
00:08:46,949 --> 00:08:51,389
of cool I get it
but that face mask who buys that face

108
00:08:51,389 --> 00:08:56,550
mask who's buying it?! okay, and that's the
thing you go here on GUCCI's website

109
00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:01,500
like &quot;okay, not my style I would not wear
any of these but then you have this and

110
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,399
it's like &quot;huh that's actually pretty
cool I quite like that&quot; how do you go

111
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:12,420
from this clean-cut and nice
all right to this is?! is that there just to

112
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:17,790
promote this is there anyone buying these?
I'm so confused

113
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:25,620
who's buying the face mask?
I don't understand! 200,000 likes I'll

114
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:29,560
buy it for a meme. I just don't get it. &quot;But Felix it really

115
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,600
just all just boils down to taste&quot;

116
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:37,649
really? really? Is that... you would... have
you seen anyone wear this?! Have you seen

117
00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:42,180
anyone wearing this? It just hit me that
someone should just make a completely

118
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:50,880
meme brand and just create these obscure
clothing items but super high prices on

119
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,440
them and people will just buy it because
it's expensive and it's loud and it's

120
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,660
out there and it just hit me that's what
people are doing that's what's happening

121
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:04,770
god dammit *laughs*
alright that's all I had to say do you

122
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:09,180
agree with me? Do you disagree? don't get
me wrong though I do really like a lot

123
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:14,580
of these brands and I find it very
interesting to see this change ah

124
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:19,290
development it fascinates me because
what we decide to wear really tells a

125
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:25,050
lot about who we are for real though
 I will get that facemask 200,000

126
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:45,000
likes let's get it. Alright bye!
