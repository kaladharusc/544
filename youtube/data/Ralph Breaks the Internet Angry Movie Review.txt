[Music]

2
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,520
hey guys Thanksgiving weekend is coming

3
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,220
up I've got a double feature here for

4
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:19,040
you we're doing two movies are you ready

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,439

6
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,290
back from Ralph breaks the internet and

7
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:26,599
we'll also be seeing Creed too because

8
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:29,270
we are fans of both of these original

9
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:32,989
films I gotta say that wreck-it Ralph is

10
00:00:32,989 --> 00:00:35,540
one of my favorite animations from

11
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,730
Disney I think it's one of the best

12
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:41,120
video gamer movies of all time you know

13
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,370
link to video games oh yeah it's right

14
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:45,550
up there for me with Street Fighter

15
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:48,649
Mortal Kombat 1 and Street Fighter

16
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:52,699
Mortal Kombat 2 wait woah no comment to

17
00:00:52,699 --> 00:00:55,730
is not even on the freakin choice better

18
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:57,859
than blood rain anyway record rob was

19
00:00:57,859 --> 00:00:59,749
one of the best films I've ever seen so

20
00:00:59,749 --> 00:01:02,329
and I think and I had really high

21
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:04,400
expectations for this a I think it's

22
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,430
wonderful I wanted to see them again but

23
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:09,260
you gotta say that the first story it's

24
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:10,970
pretty self contained story really

25
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,280
doesn't need a sequel but I love these

26
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,390
characters so much that I was like

27
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:20,810
alright and unfortunately I have to say

28
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:23,149
I probably made it worse by watching the

29
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:25,850
original right before and boy that

30
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:28,700
raised my expectations for this film

31
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,619
perhaps a little further than it could

32
00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:37,159
meet and it's just not good it's bad bad

33
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:41,450
Claude was so weak yeah it finished like

34
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:44,090
halfway through even here and the

35
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:46,009
critics are loving it I bet you this is

36
00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:49,369
gonna be one of our reviews that is so

37
00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:51,890
much different from everybody else's and

38
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:54,979
it maybe is because we're so close to

39
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:57,799
the Internet I live that life okay the

40
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:02,600
internet the social stuff and I don't

41
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,880
know it just when a film starts with the

42
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,429
director and the producers saying how

43
00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:11,330
much work it took to make the film and

44
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:13,520
bringing it to you and to enjoy the film

45
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,500
that almost always means for me it's

46
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,140
about to be a bad film yeah they were

47
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,790
looking for pity points and I know I

48
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,380
don't know if that's gonna play in

49
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,040
everything

50
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,709
it just played in in one of the smaller

51
00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:26,750
theaters actually movie house and eatery

52
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,719
so I don't think that that that's an

53
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:31,400
exclusive thing you'll probably see that

54
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,769
too and they were looking for like pity

55
00:02:33,769 --> 00:02:36,500
points but these type of movies yes they

56
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,359
do you take a long as time but you still

57
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:40,189
got to come up with a great story and

58
00:02:40,189 --> 00:02:44,239
this did not know if it did take a long

59
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:45,349
time I think it's one of the problems

60
00:02:45,349 --> 00:02:47,359
with this film is because it just came

61
00:02:47,359 --> 00:02:49,459
out and it already feels like an old

62
00:02:49,459 --> 00:02:51,530
movie like there was there like oh look

63
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,180
we're we're up-to-date with all the cool

64
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,760
memes today right kids right kids yeah I

65
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,500
just felt the entire time it was like

66
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,329
you know this new Shammi mean it's like

67
00:02:59,329 --> 00:03:01,310
hello fellow kids have I got a wreck it

68
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,629
Ralph movie for you it's like Oh

69
00:03:02,629 --> 00:03:05,480
wonderful yeah and and what cinch

70
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,780
what's crazy to me is if this was a film

71
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,639
that you know you were just kind of

72
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:12,650
doing jokes on the internet parroting

73
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,019
the Internet then then maybe it'd be

74
00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:20,030
okay but none of the jokes are funny man

75
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:22,879
I maybe laughed once in the deal with

76
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,459
one good one one good one and I can

77
00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:27,260
think of three and you can say okay well

78
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,150
you could tell us those in spoilers but

79
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:31,549
a lot of the jokes do you agree a lot of

80
00:03:31,549 --> 00:03:33,500
the jokes were cringy they didn't hate

81
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,569
to see a theater was silent even amongst

82
00:03:35,569 --> 00:03:38,030
kids in the theater the theater with

83
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,590
that yeah there were a lot of kids in

84
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,030
our theater every time they said but

85
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,919
though they were laughing it's love the

86
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:46,639
voice box but but other than that it was

87
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:49,930
it was pretty silent and I just the

88
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,370
central story here and we're not

89
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:53,870
spoiling anything we'll save them for

90
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:57,889
the spoilers is that Ralph it wants to

91
00:03:57,889 --> 00:04:00,769
remain friends with glitch and he's

92
00:04:00,769 --> 00:04:06,709
clinging about it that's that's that's

93
00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:08,989
the story Joan I was just making a point

94
00:04:08,989 --> 00:04:11,510
there's no other story than that and

95
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:13,579
then a bunch of internet jokes that

96
00:04:13,579 --> 00:04:17,239
aren't funny and what blows me away is

97
00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:19,940
you're using it feels like advertisement

98
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,580
the movie right you know it rings hollow

99
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:25,550
with a lot like Angry Birds and an emoji

100
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:29,330
movie and all these ones today's brand

101
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,310
so you've got Twitter you've got eBay

102
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:34,610
got Pinterest the answer is

103
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:37,009
Amazon a lot of these different things

104
00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:39,830
and if they can't even get the internet

105
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:42,409
right they go there's a plot point where

106
00:04:42,409 --> 00:04:44,210
they go to eBay and they start bidding

107
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:47,090
on an item you know as you do on eBay

108
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:49,879
but they don't know how it works so they

109
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:51,139
make this joke where they just bid

110
00:04:51,139 --> 00:04:53,569
higher and higher and higher and even

111
00:04:53,569 --> 00:04:55,669
though the the item was at 200 they end

112
00:04:55,669 --> 00:04:57,650
up spending something like twenty seven

113
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:59,990
thousand dollars on it and I'm like

114
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:02,629
that's not how he be even works you know

115
00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:04,490
and I know they did it for the sake of a

116
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:06,710
joke but it just wasn't all that funny

117
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:08,360
because a lot of these things have

118
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,960
already been done yeah yeah I think a

119
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,789
lot of other movies have done that kind

120
00:05:13,789 --> 00:05:17,620
of stick way better and it felt like

121
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,800
okay

122
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,779
very it's it's not memorable like I

123
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:22,490
don't remember a whole lot about we just

124
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,650
got back and there's a lot of this film

125
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:27,620
that like I had a hard time if you say

126
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,150
three funny parts like I can remember

127
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:30,409
one and that's after you and I were

128
00:05:30,409 --> 00:05:32,060
talking like right after I was like what

129
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:35,060
was that funny part in the movie I mean

130
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:38,000
I almost completely forgot I was I was

131
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,870
completely forgot with advice

132
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:45,440
it sucks man now there are you know so

133
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,900
so obviously in the trailers I think

134
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,669
what's getting a lot of people in man I

135
00:05:49,669 --> 00:05:55,669
was so it's the first film let's give

136
00:05:55,669 --> 00:05:57,710
our rating for the first film right now

137
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:00,289
okay so wreck-it Ralph to me has a

138
00:06:00,289 --> 00:06:02,240
potential of a 10 out of 10 the fact

139
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,949
that it was one of the best gaming

140
00:06:03,949 --> 00:06:06,349
movies ever it's probably a nine but I

141
00:06:06,349 --> 00:06:09,650
think I loved it so much and i rewatch

142
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:11,509
it and it's rewatchable the only thing

143
00:06:11,509 --> 00:06:14,120
about it is it's sad and and there's a

144
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,560
lot of emotion in there you kind of

145
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,719
don't want to watch it it's so good it's

146
00:06:17,719 --> 00:06:20,839
so grabs you yeah so I would give it a

147
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,909
10 I'm gonna go with 10 out of 10 on the

148
00:06:22,909 --> 00:06:24,620
original film what about you I would

149
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,089
probably give it after watching this

150
00:06:26,089 --> 00:06:30,830
this thing a 9 out of 10 you guys really

151
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:33,379
like I really liked the first one it

152
00:06:33,379 --> 00:06:35,270
wasn't it wasn't a bad I mean like I was

153
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,520
like 7 out of 10 like it's a good it's

154
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,349
good but I don't think it's it's nor

155
00:06:39,349 --> 00:06:42,620
know the highest for me I just loved all

156
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,330
the cameos from the video game

157
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:45,800
characters they seem to get it right

158
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,840
they seem to under

159
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,639
and it was interesting the whole

160
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,310
universe and world was fascinating and

161
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,350
and in a weird way I thought the world

162
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:55,990
works and the world kind of made sense

163
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:58,780
in its own way and they got that wrong

164
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,610
here you you don't get any more

165
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:02,800
videogame characters of pure Internet

166
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,600
characters the internet characters are

167
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,300
lifeless there are avatars of the human

168
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,000
beings and we see a lot more of you know

169
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,919
humans in the film I'm like I don't want

170
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,110
to see this I want to see all the the

171
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:17,050
characters within the machines in the

172
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:19,330
internet or the video games and that's

173
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:21,910
what we get the least of here the

174
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,919
supporting cast is what I'm trying to

175
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,040
say that it's nowhere near as good or as

176
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,620
charming or as cute as the supporting

177
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:32,350
cast of the original the best parts of

178
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:34,780
this film is pretty much when you know

179
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,820
they have some of the others so the

180
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,639
returning characters yeah to hold it up

181
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:42,580
they do go into a new video game an

182
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:46,060
internet online sort of racer MMO called

183
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:49,090
slaughter race and just every single

184
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:51,580
character in here just felt like the

185
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:55,900
most generic crappy 3 out of 10 game

186
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,820
that they could possibly come up with

187
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:00,700
gal gadot voice is a character in here

188
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:04,620
called slash or something shank shank

189
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:08,260
shake me come on well she was a pale

190
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:12,520
comparison to uho and fallout what did

191
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,070
y'all think about the this these you

192
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:18,849
know supporting cast I mean they tried I

193
00:08:18,849 --> 00:08:20,979
mean I like Galaga doubt I think they

194
00:08:20,979 --> 00:08:23,320
did a good job with her character here

195
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,840
but it just I didn't care like we were

196
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,940
resolved the important plot point

197
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:32,380
earlier and the the conflict in this

198
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,599
movie changed a couple times you're like

199
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:36,219
okay this is this is the quest we're

200
00:08:36,219 --> 00:08:37,779
going on oh no we're redefining the

201
00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:39,130
quest we're redefining the quest we're

202
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:41,620
redefining yes it felt all right it felt

203
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,719
good like okay we need this this thing

204
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:45,459
here to keep us going if I like the

205
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:47,620
original in that way and and then we're

206
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,120
gonna get to do some unique stuff with

207
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,640
the interim but variety it kept changing

208
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,339
and that's why I think that it felt

209
00:08:54,339 --> 00:08:56,380
meandering yeah it felt like it didn't

210
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,839
know what to do it felt like the sequel

211
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:00,460
was completely unnecessary

212
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:01,990
they wanted to make some money cuz they

213
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:03,430
knew it wouldn't make a lot of money and

214
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:05,410
the new fans like me would go and see it

215
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:07,750
yeah and there's I mean what else one of

216
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,160
their family movies are right now like

217
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,050
you're gonna see that this this weekend

218
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,700
exactly it's especially during

219
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,020
Thanksgiving like it's gonna be great

220
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,480
but for us and it sucks because I know a

221
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,430
lot of critics I think it's got a 90

222
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:21,820
percent that's well if you read the

223
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,590
reviews cuz it's like this movie was

224
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:25,090
kind of generic and unnecessary

225
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:28,060
certified fresh it's like really that

226
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,740
one that person wants to get invited to

227
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:32,050
the early premieres or any of those

228
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:34,000
other things yes there's a lot of honest

229
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,290
people on there there's a couple people

230
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:36,970
that like this was unnecessary it was a

231
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:39,400
cash grab it was busy I mean that's all

232
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,680
true it's forced and and for our

233
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,500
characters I don't really go through any

234
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,960
significant arc like they do in the

235
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,000
original yeah there's a little bit a

236
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,820
lesson about friendship but it's such a

237
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,940
small lesson that doesn't really I mean

238
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:57,550
the first one kind of almost got

239
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:00,340
something better to teach exactly the

240
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:03,160
first one but it just sucks because the

241
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,740
whole thing feels forced and worse I

242
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:08,140
think for children if you're introducing

243
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,210
them to the Internet it makes it seem

244
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,370
like this really happy and positive

245
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:14,980
place in fact I think it's probably

246
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:17,410
really bad because they do the pop-up

247
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:19,540
ads joke right they always got to do the

248
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:22,030
pop-up ads joke but here they make the

249
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:26,280
the the pop-up ad pushers friendly

250
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:30,250
helpful when if you're teaching children

251
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,230
this they pop-up ads are a good thing

252
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:34,000
you know I like that character that does

253
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,620
the pop-up happens maybe when I see a

254
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,780
pop-up ad I'll click on it know these

255
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,690
places go to websites this will fucking

256
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:43,180
fuck your computer of it they had an

257
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,610
artichoke too didn't they with the pop

258
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:47,500
of ladies it's a good come check out

259
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,360
these pop-up ladies it was real clean

260
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,070
there's like you know single mothers in

261
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:52,750
your area one right there was no

262
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,690
pornography or anything like that or

263
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:57,490
alluding to that but I guess that would

264
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,590
be the closest thing than Joe but yeah

265
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:01,000
but just they were talking about shady

266
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,100
websites and it blew me away cuz I was

267
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:07,260
like oh my god and it takes it to a

268
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,790
microtransaction fucking it reminds me

269
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:12,280
of the csgo casino thing or people are

270
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,279
selling you know items with

271
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:16,319
a game there's this you know they want

272
00:11:16,319 --> 00:11:19,110
that particular item and so this is how

273
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:20,790
you get money for their you get rich

274
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:23,370
quick schemes and fucking glitch and

275
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:23,879
Ralph's

276
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:26,879
are going on a glitch it rich quick

277
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:29,220
scheme but yet the characters behind the

278
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,199
get-rich-quick scheme are like you know

279
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:33,779
cute and lovable and happy and helpful

280
00:11:33,779 --> 00:11:35,879
and you're like oh this is great and I'm

281
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:37,769
like this is not the right message for

282
00:11:37,769 --> 00:11:40,139
all these kids in the theater but that's

283
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:42,720
just grumpy Joe talking right

284
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,290
but beyond grumpy Joe at the magic

285
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:49,459
there's no the magic wasn't here at all

286
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:53,339
no like I said the first one covered all

287
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:55,949
the bases on this this one just felt

288
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:59,100
very unnecessary I did not like to sit

289
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,160
oh man that's crazy Joe especially when

290
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,040
I see it to do it so well I'm just I'm

291
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,629
shocked because if you you're a 10

292
00:12:06,629 --> 00:12:09,379
you're a 10 out of 10 yeah first one is

293
00:12:09,379 --> 00:12:12,300
disappoint and well I mean I watched it

294
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,279
right before so that makes it even worse

295
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:18,569
of a slap in the face like it was just

296
00:12:18,569 --> 00:12:20,730
the characters going through the motions

297
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:23,639
and there was just nothing there no

298
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:26,939
we're gonna say I for me going from like

299
00:12:26,939 --> 00:12:28,139
the first one was just a pretty good

300
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:31,019
animated film like this one is not close

301
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:32,939
like not even close to the first I don't

302
00:12:32,939 --> 00:12:34,290
we've gotten the final verdict yet but

303
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:36,000
like my my expectations weren't really

304
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,490
high like yours ones and it's still way

305
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:40,889
under average I will give them some

306
00:12:40,889 --> 00:12:42,449
credit here's the parts that I like

307
00:12:42,449 --> 00:12:44,370
sitting on it a little bit now let's

308
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:46,199
talk about some positive parts of it I

309
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:48,089
liked how they talked about comments on

310
00:12:48,089 --> 00:12:50,399
the internet never read the comments so

311
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,709
that was great that one hit what I would

312
00:12:52,709 --> 00:12:54,779
hit home because we will say bad things

313
00:12:54,779 --> 00:13:01,050
about us on you know cuz it's our life

314
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:03,120
for the past 10 years I realize a lot of

315
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,439
these people don't think that you read

316
00:13:04,439 --> 00:13:06,899
it it's a it's a venting system for them

317
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:09,720
it's an entertainment system for others

318
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,249
trolls I didn't think they did include

319
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:13,050
trolls at all but they did a little bit

320
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:15,660
within those comments and it really hit

321
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,610
Ralph hard and you can tell on his

322
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:19,139
facial expression it's like man I've

323
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:20,130
been there

324
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:23,500
and those were nice as comments and rosy

325
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,860
ass movie yeah yeah so there get even

326
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,720
worse than that but they even go and do

327
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,970
a little shady stuff they do mansion the

328
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:33,910
dark web other dark net I think they

329
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,770
call it and I was like well I'm

330
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:38,830
surprised about this kind of stuff cuz

331
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:40,510
there's some pretty bad stuff there but

332
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:42,280
all right so and that's what I was

333
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,350
thinking that okay maybe this is gonna

334
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:46,300
get interesting but it really just kind

335
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,420
of spins right into yet another cliche

336
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,860
and you know how the thing is gonna work

337
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:53,020
out we know that they're wanna be

338
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,820
friends we know that they're gonna want

339
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,460
to you know how the movie is gonna end

340
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:01,600
okay and honestly I just got no more to

341
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,930
add other than you know the whole

342
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:07,780
BuzzFeed character with what's-her-name

343
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,640
yes I think it's called

344
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,980
and she's sort of the curator of liked

345
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:15,490
content she wants to get Ralph to go

346
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:17,530
viral on the internet so that he can

347
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:21,310
accomplish his quest and I just didn't

348
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:23,260
like her character he didn't really like

349
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:26,080
any of the characters except for a shank

350
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,570
but she did the best she could with what

351
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,760
she had and it's still forgettable yes

352
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,040
shank felt like a genuine a caring

353
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,200
person but still within this generic

354
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,410
area and she's felt forced as sort of a

355
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:42,610
rival in ways at least in in Ralph's

356
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:44,350
mine too none of those characters

357
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,910
mattered because none of the conflict

358
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,920
mattered anything there was a problem

359
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,360
and it got in your like okay this is the

360
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,650
main problem of the movie like nope

361
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:52,450
solvent down the dog now there's a new

362
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:53,680
conflict and we're gonna solve that in

363
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,540
10 minutes conveniently and they just

364
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,610
kept moving on to that so you don't care

365
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:59,080
about any of the characters as it goes

366
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,310
on because none of them are important

367
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:02,380
they're like pop up guys important for

368
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,420
30 seconds and then shanks important for

369
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,430
a little bit longer yes is kind of

370
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:09,790
important you don't have the the charm

371
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:12,160
in this one as much because the the

372
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,100
video game characters of the last one I

373
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,360
don't know it's just so much more

374
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,910
interesting to me a lot more action

375
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:24,910
scenes this one redoes a race and god

376
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:27,310
yeah the disney princess parts were kind

377
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:29,050
of funny so that's that we were to talk

378
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:30,730
about that so like that I was gonna say

379
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,700
that earlier what reeled me in is the

380
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,920
any princess parts you know technically

381
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,200
if you watch the end of the you know

382
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,280
wreck-it Ralph film she's a princess and

383
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:43,440
so she's one of the Disney Princesses

384
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,250
now and that juxtaposition between her

385
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,680
style and the other princesses style is

386
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,560
pretty funny and they do have a little

387
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,630
bit of a subplot with the princesses

388
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,130
that factor in towards the end of the

389
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:59,900
film but man they are really forcing

390
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:03,330
some of their dialogue like look a big

391
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:06,360
strong man let's let's save him or

392
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,460
something like that you know they're

393
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,380
trying really hard Disney's trying so

394
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,090
hard to be like you know what the Disney

395
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:14,760
Princesses never needed men at all to

396
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,760
save them ever they were always capable

397
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,190
of saving themselves trying to like wipe

398
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:23,580
history away but it's fine I mean some

399
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,260
of the Disney Princesses that's legit

400
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,600
for but some were you know sort of that

401
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,700
tropi character it's just funny to see

402
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,250
kind of Disney try to you know kick that

403
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,990
to the side and be like no these are

404
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:35,880
these these girls have always been role

405
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,310
models but anyway and then they are role

406
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:41,100
models and and I like the fact that

407
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,560
everybody gets their own little thing I

408
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,770
think there's 15 Disney Princesses now

409
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:48,600
including because I tried to counting

410
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,550
them but it was real hard because they

411
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:53,670
each a tiny little thing are we counting

412
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:55,380
any of like the Star Wars characters as

413
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:59,760
princesses now in probably not Laye I

414
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,690
don't think any because she wasn't there

415
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:05,400
you know and so that's another thing you

416
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,640
know the Star Wars cameo I thought was

417
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,040
cool as part one of the parts that

418
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,280
actually gave a little bit of tension to

419
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,810
the film though we've seen people run

420
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:17,670
away from stormtroopers a thousand times

421
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:20,400
it was fun to see our characters run

422
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,170
away from them but then it goes right

423
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:24,240
back into the boring internet characters

424
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,380
anyways so final verdict final verdict I

425
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,450
was kind of on the fence between a four

426
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:32,010
and a five but after thinking about it I

427
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,420
think it might have to go with the four

428
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,890
because it was like trying to get a

429
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:37,530
foothold of what the main plot was I was

430
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:39,690
like no I didn't care about any of the

431
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:42,180
subplots or any of the main main plots

432
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:44,400
that they had and I was kind of upset

433
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,590
they left my boy Felix out

434
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:48,960
yeah how are you gonna have Felix just

435
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,149
on the sideline user he's one of the

436
00:17:51,149 --> 00:17:53,340
better characters and the other ones and

437
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,700
the whole vanellope and for Alf

438
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,320
relationship they did a way men in the

439
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,309
first and they were just trying to

440
00:17:59,309 --> 00:18:01,919
hammer it on this movie but you just

441
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:03,240
didn't feel it there like you didn't

442
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,149
feel it at all yeah it felt yeah go

443
00:18:06,149 --> 00:18:06,389
ahead

444
00:18:06,389 --> 00:18:08,789
I agree with you a hundred percent I

445
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:11,970
think this is a below-average movie the

446
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:14,639
story didn't do it for me because it me

447
00:18:14,639 --> 00:18:16,470
and 'red it was very busy the parts that

448
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,470
I didn't enjoy were the the cultural

449
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:21,210
references like yeah I get you're making

450
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:22,710
fun of the Disney Princesses oh there's

451
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:24,869
like an Avengers reference or they had

452
00:18:24,869 --> 00:18:27,809
an Internet guy yelling asking Groot

453
00:18:27,809 --> 00:18:29,879
questions and trying to contradict like

454
00:18:29,879 --> 00:18:31,740
the lore of some of those things like I

455
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,769
like that those parts but they were so

456
00:18:33,769 --> 00:18:36,809
like rarely dropped in there and most of

457
00:18:36,809 --> 00:18:38,309
it was like oh hey I recognize the the

458
00:18:38,309 --> 00:18:41,220
Pinterest logo it's that supposed to be

459
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,289
something that like I like the Pinterest

460
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:44,999
logo is actually one of the most

461
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:48,330
significant parts of the film and from

462
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:52,710
the internet sort of cameos right when

463
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:57,809
it's money a lot of those companies and

464
00:18:57,809 --> 00:18:59,190
I saw half half a second I saw

465
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:00,720
Kickstarter I was like oh that's cool

466
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,549
Rotten Tomatoes was on there there's a

467
00:19:02,549 --> 00:19:04,860
bunch of other little ones it's like

468
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,749
that there's those scenes where you see

469
00:19:06,749 --> 00:19:08,639
all of that that's it you just see them

470
00:19:08,639 --> 00:19:12,299
and then there's just nothing as opposed

471
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:14,909
to in the video game characters you go

472
00:19:14,909 --> 00:19:17,340
into the world they have a set rules

473
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,860
that and it's interesting seeing Ralph's

474
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:22,740
break all these set rules and you know I

475
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,509
guess the whole Ralph breaks the

476
00:19:24,509 --> 00:19:27,389
internet part it just isn't all as cool

477
00:19:27,389 --> 00:19:29,309
as you thought it would be it pretty

478
00:19:29,309 --> 00:19:31,679
much goes like almost every other film

479
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,490
like cliche ending with the villain at

480
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:40,169
the end but anyway so yeah well I give

481
00:19:40,169 --> 00:19:43,619
it a 4 for 4 for slightly below average

482
00:19:43,619 --> 00:19:48,690
for both of y'all man I expected so much

483
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:52,499
more I'm gonna give it a gosh and and

484
00:19:52,499 --> 00:19:54,389
I'm so close to the Internet I was

485
00:19:54,389 --> 00:19:57,629
really just dissatisfied with it I want

486
00:19:57,629 --> 00:20:00,029
to give it a 5 but I think

487
00:20:00,029 --> 00:20:02,190
the five I'm giving it is just because I

488
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:05,909
really like the characters that I you

489
00:20:05,909 --> 00:20:10,349
know like Ralph and and Penelope and

490
00:20:10,349 --> 00:20:13,499
yeah throw another five you think this

491
00:20:13,499 --> 00:20:15,690
is an M no I've know what I'm saying is

492
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:17,969
I feel like I want to do that but the

493
00:20:17,969 --> 00:20:20,519
honest truth in the critic side of me

494
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:22,409
remember we're movie critics we're not

495
00:20:22,409 --> 00:20:25,169
just movie goers just get it sitting

496
00:20:25,169 --> 00:20:27,509
there to entertain do I think this is an

497
00:20:27,509 --> 00:20:29,429
entertaining movie for the mass audience

498
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:31,710
I think just barely I think even the

499
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:34,109
kids were mostly bored laughing a few

500
00:20:34,109 --> 00:20:35,940
times at some but jokes but that's about

501
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:36,450
it

502
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:39,330
so I'm gonna go with a four out of ten

503
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:43,559
this did not need a sequel or I needed a

504
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:46,109
sequel with a much better storyline and

505
00:20:46,109 --> 00:20:48,149
I would have kept it within the video

506
00:20:48,149 --> 00:20:49,799
game realm I know the Internet is

507
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:52,019
interesting but it just steers into that

508
00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:54,149
dangerous direction of like shit like

509
00:20:54,149 --> 00:20:56,460
the emote movie and and this is too

510
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,649
contemporary it already feels dated like

511
00:20:58,649 --> 00:21:01,469
Alex said and dated in the worst ways

512
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:04,619
and all of those jokes resulted in not a

513
00:21:04,619 --> 00:21:07,200
single funny thing really only one or

514
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,989
two okay let's get into the spoilers

515
00:21:09,989 --> 00:21:11,759
section so that we can actually tell you

516
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:14,190
those what those were otherwise thank

517
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:17,099
you so much for watching and sad no

518
00:21:17,099 --> 00:21:18,929
because I really liked it first when I

519
00:21:18,929 --> 00:21:20,669
wanted this one to be good and I'm

520
00:21:20,669 --> 00:21:23,159
probably probably gonna get beaten up in

521
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:25,320
the comments I don't remember seeing a

522
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,710
film this highly rated that I really

523
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:31,919
disliked at this level or just didn't

524
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,979
like enough last one was like BFG like a

525
00:21:34,979 --> 00:21:37,169
year ago we never we never put that

526
00:21:37,169 --> 00:21:40,019
review up but I think by now people

527
00:21:40,019 --> 00:21:42,679
realize yet BFG wasn't very good I

528
00:21:42,679 --> 00:21:45,179
wonder if they'll think that yeah this

529
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:48,570
is a much inferior sequel by the end of

530
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:50,820
it so thank you so much for watching

531
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,710
stick around for spoilers if not see you

532
00:21:52,710 --> 00:22:07,980
on the next one bye guys

533
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:11,170
welcome to the spoiler section I'm

534
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:13,510
trying to remember the the funny parts

535
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:15,190
and now I've forgotten them the only

536
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:17,500
time during the actual movie that was

537
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,140
funny yeah that you could we couldn't

538
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,820
remember what it was man there was one

539
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,770
part that I thought was funny that I

540
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:25,090
knew you thought was funny I was trying

541
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:26,710
to remember because the movies so damn

542
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:27,190
busy

543
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:30,340
it's when the the princess from brave is

544
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:33,400
talk ah ha ha ha and she has a very

545
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,500
thick Scottish accent and she's saying

546
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,050
stuff and then the Penelope can't

547
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:39,430
understand her and she was like what did

548
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:40,720
she say and all the other princess we

549
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,280
have no idea she's from like that other

550
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:48,850
studio that was the only part for all ok

551
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:50,890
what was your other part here on Mar 3

552
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:52,330
that's one of them but they said but

553
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:55,240
once right no her accent was so fake

554
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,160
though she's like oh I still have no

555
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,720
idea what the fuck she said you know

556
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,430
what if you listen real closely you

557
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:03,040
could figure it out so it's that one and

558
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,140
it's actually post-credit that mean oh

559
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,490
yeah but that doesn't count no that

560
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:10,060
doesn't count that doesn't got me the

561
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:17,710
stupid pun okay so they're going to the

562
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:20,740
viral part and and and Ralph basically

563
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:24,790
the plot line is because of Ralph they

564
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:26,890
bit not only Ralph would actually

565
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:29,380
Penelope to write that they they raise

566
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:32,650
the price of this steering wheel that

567
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:34,870
they need because Ralph once again it's

568
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:35,950
actually Ralph's fault

569
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:38,020
breaks her game yeah creating a new

570
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,760
track cuz she's getting bored with the

571
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,390
same old tracks breaks her game arcade

572
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:44,800
player breaks it and they need to get it

573
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,260
they get off eBay it was only $200 and

574
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,670
it went up to 250 and then they just

575
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:49,870
kept going up and up and up

576
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:53,140
let's now I'll obey works okay even if

577
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,630
you put in a thousand dollars and the

578
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:58,480
previous person put in 250 then it'll go

579
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,270
up automatically to 260 or something

580
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:06,420
like that so so now they owe ma to

581
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:08,860
$27,000 so like we got to make money how

582
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,240
do you make money oh you can make money

583
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,250
off of viral videos on the internet so

584
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:15,790
they go visit yes this lady who is the

585
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:18,520
curator of all the viral stuff and

586
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:21,169
barely-there kind of character it's

587
00:24:21,169 --> 00:24:23,419
moving things along no charm to or just

588
00:24:23,419 --> 00:24:26,539
no point and so Ralph does all these

589
00:24:26,539 --> 00:24:29,390
little viral videos and none of them are

590
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:32,570
like at the level that they should be

591
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:35,450
except for that B B's joke they talk

592
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:36,679
about here's all the trends on the

593
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:39,919
internet right I've seen cats babies and

594
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:43,400
then they go to the lowest of lows B

595
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,340
ponds now that was terrible but later on

596
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:48,230
Ralph makes his own where he's doing an

597
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:51,140
unboxing video and he opens it up and

598
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:53,120
bees come out Open Sesame

599
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:59,960
it was like open yeah yeah but those two

600
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,659
jokes right and then at the end of the

601
00:25:02,659 --> 00:25:05,090
film and I was like where is all the

602
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:07,909
energy you know in the internet parts

603
00:25:07,909 --> 00:25:09,650
and the good jokes and the good writing

604
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:12,039
well at the end of the film they have a

605
00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:14,840
mid-credits scene and then I stage for

606
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,419
host credit scene yeah and you see it in

607
00:25:17,419 --> 00:25:20,240
the trailer at the at the end she's like

608
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,400
I was there it's a mother and her

609
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,770
daughter in the backseat playing on her

610
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:26,990
iPad Oh what would you think of the

611
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:29,450
movie dear I liked it I was disappointed

612
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:32,150
did they show some in the trailer one in

613
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:34,549
the film and then it goes to them what

614
00:25:34,549 --> 00:25:35,960
it was in the trailer where they're

615
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,980
bringing out a bunny pancakes and

616
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:42,440
milkshake of calc shape for the cat but

617
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,240
they keep feeding the bunny pancakes

618
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,429
over because we're outcomes and he wants

619
00:25:46,429 --> 00:25:49,640
to play and then they bring massive

620
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,799
amounts of pancakes and the bunny's

621
00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:54,830
expression is so funny that's what I was

622
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:58,159
thinking the movie was different kinds

623
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,610
of like games on line it up like that

624
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:04,909
and then shit was 41 aging it was a play

625
00:26:04,909 --> 00:26:07,130
on the way those games are so repetitive

626
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:08,960
I thought they were maybe gonna get into

627
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,480
the mobile games and talk shit about

628
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,490
that but they didn't do any of that and

629
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:16,460
that one little scene in the

630
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:19,789
post-credits was better than almost the

631
00:26:19,789 --> 00:26:22,370
entire film and I was so told us it was

632
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:24,350
better than the entire fit okay but see

633
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:26,780
I try to be easy on things because I

634
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:28,429
know you know I want everybody to get

635
00:26:28,429 --> 00:26:28,900
mad

636
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,640
me and everybody says I don't know what

637
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,830
I'm talking about what movies but I'm

638
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:34,780
sorry good because but that's because a

639
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:36,190
lot of the people that watch this show

640
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:38,350
they're movie goers and we're movie

641
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:41,080
critics and when you when you watch a

642
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:44,470
hundred films in a year you start to see

643
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:47,020
this thing has been done before has this

644
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:49,030
been done effectively and is it

645
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:52,060
effective so you know when and and this

646
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:54,100
is just not effective and you can see

647
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:57,280
the inspired bit there at the end and

648
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:00,190
it's unlike almost the whole film and

649
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:01,870
it's like damn man I wish we could have

650
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,880
got that and then when you're left I

651
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,770
stayed after the credits and it's

652
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:08,680
another really funny internet joke where

653
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,360
they're like stick around for the

654
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:13,330
trailer of frozen - and it says click

655
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:15,220
here and then the little icon goes click

656
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:17,110
here and it clicks and then it turns

657
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:20,140
into a rick roll only it's ralph singing

658
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,750
along with ashley is never gonna give

659
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:25,180
you up and it was worth it I really

660
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,950
enjoyed it because I loved that song I

661
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:29,470
mean me and Joe we go to karaoke will

662
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:31,330
sing that because we break out our

663
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:34,570
internet cred but you know what it just

664
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:38,560
man it sucks because you see those two

665
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,080
flashes those two moments and you wish

666
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,480
the film was composed of those where

667
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,460
they're going into those various worlds

668
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:48,550
rather than the the hollow little people

669
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:51,340
walking around as their internet avatars

670
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:54,000
going and buying stuff and it's just

671
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,370
lifeless and the little character is

672
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:59,830
here and there aren't interesting enough

673
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:02,260
as compared to the previous record

674
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:04,570
Ralph's film to you know hold the film

675
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:06,850
and support the film and with a weak

676
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:09,880
central plot fell apart do you saw the

677
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,920
first one in theaters right yeah and do

678
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,570
you remember what the audience was like

679
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:16,540
yeah they enjoyed it yeah when we left

680
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:18,760
like the theater was silent yeah no one

681
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,560
in there was was thoroughly happy they

682
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,390
laugh it was a few laughs more than we

683
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:24,910
were laughing but it wasn't it wasn't

684
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:26,710
like the original record Ralph and at

685
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:28,540
the end just so you know it's because

686
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,240
Ralph is getting jealous that Penelope

687
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:34,840
glitch is going into the this new racing

688
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:37,750
game and it's all badass and fucking

689
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:40,780
dark and dirty and thieves thieves and

690
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:44,740
and guns and sharks eating dogs and just

691
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:47,410
crazy shit and she wants to live there

692
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:49,870
she wants to be there like she never

693
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:53,470
really was felt a part of the gumball

694
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:58,570
candy rush right and this new shank

695
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:02,170
character she's enamored with and Ralph

696
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:04,570
gets jealous and so he puts a virus in

697
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:06,970
that game to shut that game down or slow

698
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:08,710
it down so she's not interested in

699
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:09,400
anymore

700
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:12,010
ends up fucking that whole game over and

701
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:14,740
and in his his fuck-ups fresh is the

702
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,570
whole internet so that's him breaking

703
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:18,610
the internet which creates lots of

704
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:21,850
little zombie fucking Ralph's and they

705
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:23,860
combine into one massive Ralph's how

706
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,660
many times have you seen that when

707
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:27,700
something combine for that horrible

708
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:37,390
Batman movie yeah yeah but that one was

709
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:41,530
particularly I still like though you

710
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,660
know what I like that Batman movie

711
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,670
better than this movie we just thought

712
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:47,380
that doesn't mean anything cuz I do too

713
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:49,570
I mean just because this that movie was

714
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:54,010
horrible doesn't know anyways so yeah he

715
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:56,560
becomes a bunch of Ralph's and it's a

716
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:59,200
big monster Ralph and they stop Rob by

717
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,970
talking to him and making him realize

718
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:02,710
something they could have done right at

719
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:08,080
the beginning insecure yeah the bad guy

720
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,060
the film was rouse insecurities yeah

721
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:14,710
that's it the fuck you brought these

722
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:16,660
characters bag you put all this time and

723
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:18,850
effort it's almost insulting like that

724
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:20,410
far problem a lot of people worked

725
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:22,240
really hard on this we hope you enjoy it

726
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,340
well give them a better fucking story

727
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,500
give them a better fucking script give

728
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,300
them jokes and it's funny they make us

729
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:31,510
laugh and and now we have one of those

730
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:34,720
inferior sequels that that I'll always

731
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,640
remember is you won't want to wreck

732
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,140
around yeah you want to watch the sequel

733
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:40,810
after and this is exactly like Pixar has

734
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:42,520
a policy that they don't do sequels

735
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,260
outside all fairies they left that a

736
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:46,630
long time ago because they're doing C

737
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:49,240
Quietus now they are totally in sequel

738
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:52,330
itis Toy Story for their choice or was

739
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:54,110
Mars 3 those are the

740
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:57,140
incredibles - there's there's more

741
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:59,660
there's even more than that I'm sure I'm

742
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:01,790
missing one but yeah but you're right

743
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:04,130
they they used to have a pause oh it's

744
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:05,809
our policy probably before they got

745
00:31:05,809 --> 00:31:07,610
turned a little more corporate by Disney

746
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:09,140
as look we got it we're telling you

747
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:11,570
self-contained stories and unless

748
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:13,670
there's a really good story we're gonna

749
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:15,380
stay away from sequels and they should

750
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,760
have stayed away from the sequel here

751
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,350
but this thing's gonna make a ton of

752
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:19,940
money the critics are gonna love it

753
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:22,370
anyways and people are gonna give it a

754
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:24,320
pass because the first one was so good

755
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,210
but here the angry Joe show will tell

756
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:28,040
you like it is and I think you should

757
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,200
save your money on this one and watch

758
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,270
something instead so we have to hurry up

759
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:34,460
and go to Creed 2 and hopefully that

760
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,919
will be a better film that won't we just

761
00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:40,340
watched hope so yeah alright guys thank

762
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,929
you so much for watching anything else

763
00:31:41,929 --> 00:31:45,710
to end Joe everything was all

764
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:47,660
forgettable yeah I know this so there

765
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:49,130
was a Twitter joke and I was waiting cuz

766
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:50,690
I'm on Twitter all the time you know we

767
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:53,630
got YouTube and Twitter YouTube was only

768
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:55,700
factored in very slightly for the viral

769
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,530
videos and even then they kind of pushed

770
00:31:57,530 --> 00:31:59,540
it more towards like a BuzzFeed kind of

771
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:01,820
thing but the Twitter thing I was

772
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,710
waiting to see if I can find like the

773
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:05,720
trolls on Twitter but now it's all

774
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,570
positivity and one bird tweet you know

775

the tweets a cat video and all the other

776
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,679

778
