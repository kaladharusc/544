developer and publishers now apparently

00:18:40,149 --> 00:18:43,840
that that you know I'm a real

225
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,460
down-to-earth and good people you know I

226
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,230
prepared is interactive CD Projekt RED

227
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:50,140
Digital Extremes way up they're very

228
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:52,240
easy to talk to walk up to and just ask

229
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,760
questions they you know they like they

230
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,140
treat people like family and that's

231
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:58,360
that's really really cool and a game

232
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,630
that's five years old and you're still

233
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:03,039
evolving you're still throwing punches

234
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,080
you're still throwing punches with the

235
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,419
big boys better than the big boys look

236
00:19:07,419 --> 00:19:10,390
did you space battles you know this is

237
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:12,070
this speaks to my heart

238
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:13,450
yeah don't know what it is and it's

239
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:16,480
 Steve it's you know Steve even

240
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,940
he thinks like me Steve is literally me

241
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:21,700
in ten years I think he's taking taking

242
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:26,529
older than you know but you know and you

243
00:19:26,529 --> 00:19:28,480
know he had more you know Star Trek

244
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,370
you're praying almost where you have

245
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,210
ended

246
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:35,550
it's like Joe you could be on wetlands I

247
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,770
could be piloting it and and Dell could

248
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:39,720
you know be putting a higher you can

249
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,620
transfer like a shield so that is

250
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,110
everything I was like it's nice time and

251
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:55,530
then a new gun drops out and then it's

252
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:59,400
like skate for actually so it's it's

253
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,440
funny because yeah I'd have been happy

254
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,490
with just before Fortuna yep you know

255
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:07,080
and that would have been a solid but

256
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,150
then they were like oh so that's it and

257
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:12,450
then you know what's going on and then

258
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:14,070
she gets up of course it was all planned

259
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:16,350
yeah but it was it was a lot a lot of

260
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:16,679
fun

261
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:19,170
I did not bank space battles raiding

262
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:21,570
parties now I don't care if it's one

263
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:23,580
mission and you know I've talked with

264
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,170
them before and they've they want to you

265
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:27,740
know explore this and you have you know

266
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,820
procedurally generated levels you have

267
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:32,130
you know these open-world areas or at

268
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:33,809
the normal warframe and now you've got

269
00:20:33,809 --> 00:20:35,130
these these space battle kind of

270
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:37,500
sections and when they fully implement

271
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,120
it they'll continue to evolve it like

272
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,059
they're continuing to evolve warframe so

273
00:20:41,059 --> 00:20:44,190
the potential is amazing from there

274
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:47,490
before destiny that's the me to Star

275
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:49,230
Wars Battlefront Star Wars Battlefront

276
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:52,170
to see this or was about frontier space

277
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:54,210
battles it's so original but not raining

278
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:56,570
party that's what I'm talking about and

279
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:59,250
they caught me on camera you know they

280
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,809
were like trying to get impressions and

281
00:21:00,809 --> 00:21:02,460
stuff food I was just gushing you were

282
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,140
guys that was like literally just

283
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,870
walking out so really cool really cool

284
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:09,660
game and no reason not to play cuz men

285
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:12,690
just playing free it's a three as me now

286
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:14,880
yeah there's a grind like a

287
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,990
oh yeah of course

288
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:19,080
like in my opinion like when a game is

289
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,840
free-to-play and it is this top quality

290
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,550
drip and it's throwing punches like this

291
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:25,980
I give it I give money yeah oh yeah oh I

292
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,510
think it's worth 20 I think he's worth

293
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:30,360
30 you know and then to customize I

294
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,490
problem with that so yeah guys guys

295
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:35,370
warframe amazing that it's not a dying

296
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:36,960
game or a dead game and you got a game

297
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,670
to come out and then die no it is

298
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:40,770
getting sort of popular that's actually

299
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:42,150
getting more and more popular like this

300
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:46,170
stream I think it was like 388 358

301
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:47,640
something like that thousand viewers

302
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,790
last year you thinking got up to like

303
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:52,560
67,000 so it's just getting bigger it's

304
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,260
exploding exponentially even talking

305
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,880
about is the sweet let's put

306
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,820
that on the switch yeah yeah now I'm

307
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:02,730
actually convinced there's more game

308
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:04,320
because Joe is like I like it in a

309
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,450
switching to cuz I want to play pokemon

310
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,310
with Joe and trade and fighting battle

311
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:16,860
