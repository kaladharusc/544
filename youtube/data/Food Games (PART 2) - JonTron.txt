I don't remember any of that happening

13
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,590
that is not what happened in the last

14
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,780
episode what I do remember is that we

15
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,580
played a ton of games based on fast food

16
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,409
marketing campaigns but if you thought

17
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:16,320
we were done oh how wrong you were next

18
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,720
on the list the noid this was one of the

19
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,700
strangest marketing campaigns of all

20
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,250
time for Domino's Pizza what exactly did

21
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,890
they think this would do for their brand

22
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:30,630
feature that just wasn't right what time

23
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:32,789
I got annoyed the pepperonis didn't come

24
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:35,280
on my delivery pizza that I forgot to

25
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,999
put them on is do a pizza well then he

26
00:01:38,999 --> 00:01:41,249
just sounds like a bad guy to hang

27
00:01:41,249 --> 00:01:43,140
around then doesn't he the Domino's

28
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:43,890
Pizza

29
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:48,030
the noise is this really a testament to

30
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:50,580
the pizza the box it's packaged in it I

31
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,470
don't know what the appeal was here but

32
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,300
apparently he was popular enough to get

33
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:57,150
his own game hmm not gonna tip on this

34
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,340
delivery the game starts off with a yo

35
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,479
noid update wild creatures led by mr.

36
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:06,510
green are a sailing New York City well

37
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,520
that don't sound too good the mayor

38
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,590
knows that only the noid has the power

39
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:14,220
to stop them the mayor spelled MA y ER

40
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,500
huh I'll assume he's referring to John

41
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,870
Mayer yes very popular in the yo noid

42
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,760
universe for uh because of how much he

43
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,160
looks like a big pepperoni using his

44
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,980
super yo-yo and other inventions he will

45
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,170
try that's it

46
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:30,270
he will try well that's all you could

47
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:34,709
ask us somebody isn't it ah yes the very

48
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:36,870
accurate map of New York City we've got

49
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,610
here of course pictured after a

50
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:40,440
devastating nuclear holocaust has

51
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,000
ravaged the world and grass and weeds

52
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,220
have consumed the lands but at least

53
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,380
Trump towers still survived I started

54
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,030
off in Brooklyn my father gave me a

55
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,769
small loan of a million dollars I came

56
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:51,720
into Manhattan Oh God this is the

57
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,340
alternate universe where Trump wins

58
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,989
isn't it this first level here is

59
00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:00,269
already excruciating the perspective on

60
00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:01,950
the water is all out of whack it's

61
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:04,140
completely disorienting sometimes you

62
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,370
think you land on the wood but you'll

63
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:07,080
just touch the water and die or some

64
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,430
fish will come up from beneath you and

65
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,299
fuck your shit up

66
00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:10,950
there's no checkpoint so you have to do

67
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:13,019
each level in one beautiful run it's

68
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:15,530
hard

69
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:18,690
welcome to the pizza eating contest

70
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:27,720
oh boy I think I can win this one way

71
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:34,470
too much to the pizza the area champion

72
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:37,260
goes first huh the fuck does that mean

73
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,299
after the end of each level you get to

74
00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:41,310
this strange card game thing apparently

75
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:44,820
the pink guy's the area champion I don't

76
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,250
really understand the rules at all

77
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,530
how many pizzas do I want but what kind

78
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:50,340
of question is that

79
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,020
give me them all from what I can gather

80
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,820
you just pick a bigger number than he

81
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,440
picks and whoever picks the bigger

82
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,600
number wins the battle the first the

83
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,460
fill is pizza meter down here wins

84
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:02,100
overall pizza meter I said pizza meter

85
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,230
don't forget that ever tell that you

86
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:04,830
kids

87
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,780
tell us your grandchildren so it's just

88
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,610
luck I guess why would you ever pick

89
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:12,420
this smaller number hehehe I cream yeah

90
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,950
okay just as long as it's not on my

91
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:16,920
delivery guy isn't that overdoing it and

92
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,970
you're the one that's the supposed

93
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,859
champion of this shit you're the one

94
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:20,820
making me do it

95
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,950
oh I get it now I need to eat a pizza

96
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,630
because I'm having a fucking panic

97
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,980
attack over here I need it I've got a

98
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,410
stress eat chester Cheetah also at his

99
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:30,540
own game way back when chester Cheetah

100
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:36,450
too cool to fool God I move so slow is

101
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:38,490
that some sort of joke he's a cheetah I

102
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:39,960
think this is the slowest video game

103
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,550
character of all time I mean that that

104
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:44,940
turtle is faster love to be fair he is

105
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,410
on roller skate so it's not really a

106
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:48,690
fair fight maybe this is the actual

107
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:50,190
speed of a cheetah who's been fed an

108
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,320
exclusive diet of cheetos his entire

109
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,380
life the music to it just gets in your

110
00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:01,089
head man

111
00:05:01,089 --> 00:05:03,799
if you want to run which is still not

112
00:05:03,799 --> 00:05:05,299
fast by the way if you could believe it

113
00:05:05,299 --> 00:05:06,919
it might be slower you got to hold down

114
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:08,989
a button and then he's like that yeah

115
00:05:08,989 --> 00:05:10,849
I'm gonna do it he doesn't even do it

116
00:05:10,849 --> 00:05:12,709
right away it's the most unsatisfying

117
00:05:12,709 --> 00:05:15,139
anti-climactic thing ever but at least I

118
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:16,849
can hump the ground in the pipe in a

119
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:19,639
cave pipe can't get to the exit but I

120
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:21,679
can do this yeah uh-huh

121
00:05:21,679 --> 00:05:23,449

126
00:05:30,589 --> 00:05:37,389

kool-aid man three Atari

138
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,380
I'm gonna remember this moment for the

139
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,890
rest of my life in this you play as a

140
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:27,470
jug of kool-aid I guess if you touch any

141
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,390
of these cherry bomb' guys your pitcher

142
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,830
goes all around the goddamn place

143
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,690
bouncing from wall to wall but

144
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:34,400
occasionally the cherry bombs stopped to

145
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,070
take a diabetic sugar lined piss and

146
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,900
then for some reason at that point you

147
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:42,200
can collect them huh what I can't move

148
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,040
anymore

149
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,980
the talkest mic has only just begun I

150
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:49,370
have no idea what just happened the game

151
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:51,620
just stopped I mean I'm in a real loss

152
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,080
it just went black and stopped I'm not

153
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,460
even trying to make a joke here can

154
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,500
anyone make sense of this I know it's an

155
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,390
old game but it's not even trying to be

156
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:01,550
coherent so I'll fill you in

157
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,320
apparently what's happening here is that

158
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,540
below all of this is a body of water

159
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:08,060
very obvious I know that these guys

160
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,370
known as Thirsty's are sucking up

161
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,800
through straws yeah those are straws I

162
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,570
guess not sure what the multicolored

163
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:16,580
thing is about but hey like I said this

164
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:19,250
was 1983 anything was possible they

165
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,540
elected Ronald Reagan and he was

166
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,640
pictured at least several times with the

167
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,590
chimpanzee here and the United States

168
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:26,510
though is also in the feature film

169
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,730
bedtime for Bonzo you know you can only

170
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:30,020
collect these guys if they're drinking

171
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,880
the water if the water goes down all the

172
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,810
way you lose

173
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:34,760
truth be told I don't know why didn't

174
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,770
buy this game twice up next the

175
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:39,200
California Raisins also known as one of

176
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,510
the most terrifying commercial campaigns

177
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:44,000
to ever grace the United States they

178
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,790
made Michael Jackson a drag the King of

179
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,500
Pop they've made him a son reached great

180
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,270
now you may not even have known this

181
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,310
game existed but that's because it

182
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:54,470
technically doesn't this game was fully

183
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:56,810
finished and then never released the few

184
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,550
real copies of it that do exist are held

185
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:00,320
in very high value so I happen to have a

186
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,780
reproduction card here it starts up with

187
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:06,020
this nice splash screen okay there's

188
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,720
some judge raisins on a stand Cal Rab

189
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,730
what does that mean is that short for

190
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:13,220
California Raisins ban if so why is it

191
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,960
on the judge stand do they own the state

192
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,790
the story here is that the California

193
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,770
Raisins have been kidnapped along with

194
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,420
all their music but you know did you

195
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,490
save an mp3 somewhere you could just you

196
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:24,440
know burn a couple on a disc then it's

197
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,090
not lost anymore in this game you

198
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:28,190
apparently attack by scooping a piece of

199
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,600
your stomach out and throwing it at the

200
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,280
enemy by the end of this level there

201
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,170
won't be much of them left it plays

202
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:33,860
pretty close

203
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,479
what you'd expect from a platformer from

204
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:37,880
this era I mean it's not great but I

205
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,039
don't see why it was cancelable I mean

206
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,180
they already spent all the money on

207
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,680
making it there's dead ends on

208
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,420
practically every level which is really

209
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:44,959
annoying

210
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,060
but the bosses are pretty cool I guess I

211
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,700
mean I think but the cool subjective

212
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:57,709
really God has forsaken us okay that was

213
00:08:57,709 --> 00:08:59,120
the last boss I put him out of his

214
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,970
misery I don't know if all this was

215
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:04,079
worth it guys

216
00:09:04,079 --> 00:09:07,959
Congrats your 800k when you beat the

217
00:09:07,959 --> 00:09:10,659
game that says congrats you raisins and

218
00:09:10,659 --> 00:09:12,819
it was worth it

219
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:14,409
alright here's a more straightforward

220
00:09:14,409 --> 00:09:16,179
one pepsi invaders

221
00:09:16,179 --> 00:09:18,699
it's just space invaders but for pepsi

222
00:09:18,699 --> 00:09:21,939
but wait a second up there it says coke

223
00:09:21,939 --> 00:09:23,769
so who's this game supposed to advertise

224
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:26,889
for Coke or Pepsi well wait a sec coke

225
00:09:26,889 --> 00:09:29,139
wins but this is before the game even

226
00:09:29,139 --> 00:09:31,629
starts I didn't do anything this is

227
00:09:31,629 --> 00:09:33,549
irrelevant to the matter at hand this is

228
00:09:33,549 --> 00:09:37,089
just a statement oh I see so you're

229
00:09:37,089 --> 00:09:40,749
shooting Pepsi as Coke you're destroying

230
00:09:40,749 --> 00:09:43,359
them very subtle guys after some

231
00:09:43,359 --> 00:09:45,099
research I found out that unsurprisingly

232
00:09:45,099 --> 00:09:46,449
this is an altered version of space

233
00:09:46,449 --> 00:09:48,129
invaders but it was commissioned by

234
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:50,229
coca-cola themselves for their 1983

235
00:09:50,229 --> 00:09:52,479
sales convention in some circles the

236
00:09:52,479 --> 00:09:54,549
game is just referred to as coke winds

237
00:09:54,549 --> 00:09:57,249
probably a reference to that nice one

238
00:09:57,249 --> 00:09:57,549
guys

239
00:09:57,549 --> 00:09:59,439
classy I'm sure everyone was very

240
00:09:59,439 --> 00:10:01,779
impressed can you imagine them putting

241
00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:03,909
this up on a big screen at a convention

242
00:10:03,909 --> 00:10:06,129
I mean how insecure you gotta be there

243
00:10:06,129 --> 00:10:08,769
were only about 125 copies made total

244
00:10:08,769 --> 00:10:11,379
nowadays they can go up for $1,300 or

245
00:10:11,379 --> 00:10:20,639
more

246
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:23,199
what if you wait for the pee to come

247
00:10:23,199 --> 00:10:24,579
down and kill you it just never does

248
00:10:24,579 --> 00:10:26,589
what can I say guys you have such a

249
00:10:26,589 --> 00:10:28,629
superior product that Pepsi can't even

250
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:35,529
win when it wins ok coke we get it you

251
00:10:35,529 --> 00:10:37,600
had your chance let's see how a tasteful

252
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,459
company like Pepsi would market their

253
00:10:39,459 --> 00:10:47,170
product now we're getting into some deep

254
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:48,670
shit I don't know if I'm ready for that

255
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:53,620
also what what what what believe it or

256
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,360
not what you just witnessed was not the

257
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,459
confiscated home videotape of a serial

258
00:10:57,459 --> 00:10:59,829
killers mad ramblings it was an official

259
00:10:59,829 --> 00:11:02,470
cutscene from Pepsi Zone official

260
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:06,939
PlayStation 1 classic Pepsi man look at

261
00:11:06,939 --> 00:11:08,889
this is how it really starts from moment

262
00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:10,569
one it looks like a snuff film or

263
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:12,879
something as puzzling as it is Pepsi

264
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:14,410
made the choice to include all this

265
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:16,600
live-action footage as part of the game

266
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,730
the game was Japan exclusive but all the

267
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:20,680
cutscenes take place in Los Angeles

268
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,860
California with this guy oh jeez

269
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:26,290
shoenice over here he speaks English -

270
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:28,809
he subtitled in Japanese look I even

271
00:11:28,809 --> 00:11:30,610
found the exact corner is on here in the

272
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:32,889
city of Inglewood represent let's get

273
00:11:32,889 --> 00:11:34,389
together and make this a hallowed sight

274
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:36,730
huh put up a monument or two it looks

275
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:39,009
like this guy left such a legacy you ran

276
00:11:39,009 --> 00:11:40,540
the whole block out of business

277
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,069
except for that I'll play a local of

278
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:44,259
course cuz let's face it our body needs

279
00:11:44,259 --> 00:11:46,809
the Crazy Chicken hey what do you see in

280
00:11:46,809 --> 00:11:48,910
there actually don't tell me I want to

281
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:55,480
keep that part of myself intact you're

282
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,250
doing pretty good that doesn't mean much

283
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:00,399
coming from you in this world everyone

284
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,139
relies on Pepsi man to solve their

285
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:05,339
problems by restocking Pepsi machines

286
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:08,259
yeah ok checks out I got a call that a

287
00:12:08,259 --> 00:12:09,970
vending machine ahead we ran out of

288
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:10,740
Pepsi

289
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:13,500
and I was just on my way there oh my god

290
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,360
that's like real desperation in that

291
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,550
man's voice he sounds like his family's

292
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:21,480
been taken hostage whoa okay this is

293
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,430
crazy I can't believe I've never heard

294
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:25,170
of this you run through the streets and

295
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:26,730
even people's homes while collecting

296
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:29,160
Pepsi cans and dodging Pepsi trucks and

297
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,230
other obstacles the comedic timing here

298
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:35,190
is greats very Japanese I don't know

299
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:36,540
though there's just something unsettling

300
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,970
about this it's got a Truman Show thing

301
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:39,600
going on

302
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,790
there's no music and everything in this

303
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:45,270
world is Pepsi they live they die for

304
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:48,630
Pepsi Pepsi is the currency but Pepsi is

305
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:51,210
also the enemy Pepsi stops us but it

306
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:53,880
keeps us going to Pepsi is the hero and

307
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,310
the villain the good and the bad again

308
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:58,620
in the a one thing cannot be wholly good

309
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:01,080
or wholly evil that would be naive and

310
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,750
unrealistic to assume yes even our

311
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,790
corporate Titans have a crack in their

312
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:07,950
facade well their logo it makes so much

313
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:10,590
sense now the blue represents the Pepsi

314
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:13,080
and the red represents the Pepsi and the

315
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,600
white represents an intricate inside job

316
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,300
carried out by reptilians Pepsi hung on

317
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,610
a cross he died for your sins

318
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:22,380
he was then jabbed in the side with a

319
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:25,020
spear by the Romans and America what

320
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,750
came out was Pepsi and the Roman soldier

321
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,610
he drank from the Pepsi and he said well

322
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:32,070
objectively I just prefer Coke and then

323
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:34,440
three days later the Pepsi was flat

324
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,720
everything's going dark well grimbo

325
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,130
bring me a cold one Oh

326
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:44,720
Rambo drink too much whoa whoa no

327
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,660
Grimble Grimble come back to me come

328
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:55,599

329
00:13:55,599 --> 00:13:57,109
