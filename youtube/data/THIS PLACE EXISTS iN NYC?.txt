1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,410
yeah

2
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:21,040
yeah

3
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:25,090
yeah

4
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:35,360
that's being mildly exciting to share with you in boosting board news

5
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,640
the original boosted board that it boosted one has been returned to me from

6
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,949
Busan board headquarters where they were fixing it

7
00:00:42,949 --> 00:00:45,980
new belts new actually only the fixating is nothing was broken

8
00:00:46,489 --> 00:00:49,820
belts are where item they just go they replace them

9
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:57,500
listen to that power see these bizarre scratches their scars of usage

10
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:03,949
yesterday's vlog I had some very serious technical issues with this very

11
00:01:03,949 --> 00:01:05,330
microphone here

12
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:09,470
my audio is completely beat and a lot of people in the comments suggested all

13
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,270
these technical fixes

14
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:15,530
I appreciate your suggestions but I find them frustrating because at that you're

15
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:20,690
not telling you don't know the truth is like yes I could attach like another

16
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:24,530
reporter or a really high quality recorder or i can even attach like a

17
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:27,890
small reporter and then I'd be recording audio independently and there's no

18
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:31,580
chance to be screwed up where I could put like a better microphone on there or

19
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:34,670
I could use like whatever this new microphone is or I could just go

20
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:36,500
wireless and record it that way

21
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:40,130
I mean there are million options and I could absolutely do

22
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:43,759
but I wanted to explain today a little bit about like to share a little bit of

23
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,050
the understanding of why don't give a shit

24
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:49,800
about these technical innovations I just want what's easiest

25
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:56,130
I'm gonna do some drawings here these about principles principalities

26
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:00,810
principle tells principles internet filmmaking principles

27
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:05,250
it goes like this here's me with my ideas on the other side of the spectrum

28
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:09,119
is you the viewers who want to receive my ideas

29
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,660
I think otherwise why are you watching this stuff i need to get my ideas from

30
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:17,910
like conception to you the viewer and what stands between me and the viewers

31
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:22,590
are these factors like the cameras in the entity in the posting and all this

32
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,150
other tech stuff

33
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:28,680
my job especially when it comes of logging is to marginalize all of this

34
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,760
stuff the more i can remove them the more simple i can make the process the

35
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,170
better on the y-axis here it goes from easy to use to tremendous pain in the

36
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:40,410
ass on the x-axis here is the quality

37
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:44,970
it looks like a potato vs like the highest quality there is so the more of

38
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:46,350
a pain in the ass it is

39
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:50,400
the higher the quality and with these blogs I want to hit a sweet spot that's

40
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,200
like right here

41
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,950
so the quality is good and it's not too hard to use

42
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:00,120
so I want a microphone that I never have to think about I want a camera that

43
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,280
focus is not any input from me

44
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,190
I just want to hit a button and have it worked and I want to look as good as

45
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:05,970
possible

46
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:08,730
that's why i don't use any more difficult to use hardware than what I

47
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:09,750
already use

48
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:13,350
that's why I really don't get excited about new camera tech gear

49
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:16,350
I just do whatever is easiest

50
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:27,460
I have this leather jacket not this like an actual leather jacket

51
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:32,530
it's my favorite jacket I've ever had but it's not super high quality got some

52
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:35,680
store on broadway and it's starting to fall apart

53
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,490
I've been looking

54
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:43,610
how I've been looking but unable to find like a suitable replacement so I asked

55
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:49,610
my friend who custom makes letter codes here in New York City and he could

56
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:55,490
reverse-engineer my co and remake it using like the highest quality materials

57
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:03,710
he has access to just to give a shameless plug to my friends store

58
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:09,410
if you're ever in New York City on Crosby Street come to Jean shop for the

59
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:12,380
finest quality jeans and leather goods around

60
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:15,560
it's a parent now you know I'm starting to I appreciate it

61
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,170
I appreciate it

62
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:20,410
the other good on who says New Yorkers are rude

63
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:32,039
just for the record my favorite jeans in my opinion the greatest things in the

64
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:34,229
world come from the shop

65
00:04:34,229 --> 00:04:37,590
they're fantastically expensive but super super high quality stuff

66
00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:44,220
this man here this is eric he is the proprietor and owner of gene shop

67
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,940
what are you going to midtown

68
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:08,780
and this is midtown that look at this place

69
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:13,640
this is insane so you don't think places like this still exists in new york city

70
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:18,620
but they do that when people like Casey where'd you get that when I jacket I can

71
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:22,670
be like you just come up this place on 38 street right so this is the original

72
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:24,260
here

73
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:28,610
so this is like a cloth version of what's going to be the leather jacket

74
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:32,810
right now we're sizing it and it's just too small

75
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:35,810
doesn't get the arms

76
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:52,870
so they're gonna they're gonna modify this show you this week

77
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:56,110
come back up here i'm gonna try it on again and then if it's the next time

78
00:05:56,110 --> 00:06:03,910
