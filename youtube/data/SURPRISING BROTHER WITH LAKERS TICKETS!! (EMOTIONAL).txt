00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,689
but yeah should be an interesting day

65
00:02:07,689 --> 00:02:10,000

68
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:20,150
like basketball I don't know you tell me

69
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,599
[Music]

70
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:42,239
woman do you like basketball because

71
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:54,190
almost he's bigger than you 200 right

72
00:02:54,190 --> 00:03:03,850
now if you like bucks you wouldn't take

73
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,440
a look of his am I crazy but I don't

74
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:13,780
think Jonah's gross yeah leave it to us

75
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:18,910
to forget about the 12 year old no okay

76
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,799
David this is what happened Josh came

77
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:22,690
over and shot at my house and he didn't

78
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,790
put the table away so then I instead of

79
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,230
sending a text I just called him and I

80
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:27,910
said hey very nicely I said when you

81
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,470
come over he just put stuff away that'd

82
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,030
be awesome and I think Josh was really

83
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:33,760
hurt by what I said okay I wasn't but I

84
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,090
didn't deserve it I was in bed with

85
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:39,250
Paige and I'm like I see a call from

86
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,620
Jason it's like 6:30 at my page we're

87
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,000
getting invited to dinner where do I

88
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,230
have a double date jay-z and then he's

89
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:51,609
like hey so listen now granted he's not

90
00:03:51,609 --> 00:03:53,410
wrong but if you remember that day

91
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:55,030
because I do because I'll never forget

92
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:57,819
it now I came over and then everybody

93
00:03:57,819 --> 00:03:59,739
was over and Scott wanted to get shot

94
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,599
with a paintball gun and Toddie and you

95
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,040
and everybody butter butter buddy and

96
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,690
then I had to rush out and thus I

97
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:06,910
figured like this table is being used as

98
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,030
a good common thing

99
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:10,600
not realizing that it probably better

100
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,790
yeah so I got chewed out by you did not

101
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:16,310
get chewed out I said it so nicely

102
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:18,170

103
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:20,269

00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:33,340
right I did many years I remember the

143
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,380
best part was when you were in your 40s

144
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,970
and you were still playing against

145
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:39,520
people in your 20s exactly just like

146
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:45,130
Brady yeah I remember used to break up a

147
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:46,750
lot of fights thank you dude

148
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,940
yeah all the younger guys that were

149
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,009
there would start fights yeah that

150
00:07:51,009 --> 00:07:54,250

155
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:04,950

156
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:08,370
stomach it does is this a monument

157

227
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:04,260
opinions about us and they don't know us

228

really it's insane some of that like

230
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,950
most of the people that we meet like are

231
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:13,620
so nice and so supportive but the people

232
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,690
that probably don't say hi to us in

233
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:17,100
public and stuff you guys write things

234
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,829

00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,029
the way to the Lakers game when I got

242

so many people in the world just don't

273
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:33,140
don't try it they just like sit around

274
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,190
