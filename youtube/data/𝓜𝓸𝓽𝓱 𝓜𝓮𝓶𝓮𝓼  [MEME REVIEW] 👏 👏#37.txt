We got Mickey Mouse.

00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,060
Hey, what is he doing?

30
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,480
Is he gonna take pizza?

31
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,460
That would be spoopy.

How am I going to trust Mickey Mouse from now on?

00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,740
I thought he was one of the good guys. *same, now I can watch Mickey Mouse jumpscares and think 'BASED ON A TRUE STORY*

We don't play around here on spoopy month on meme review.

I bet you have your flesh and skin exposed. What are you some kind of loser?

57
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,220
I bet you fapped to Bowsette in October inappropriate.

58
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:43,360
Eggcuse me Bowsette, you can look at the door, because I only want

61
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:54,760
When she sends nudes, but she doesn't send her skeleton.

62
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,140
I hate it.

63

Disgusting, does she not get it?

All right we have Peppa the pig, Peppa the pig. Oh, oh my GOD

Hi Um, let me get a large LÄMP. Can someone please give møth a LÄMP? I think it's only fair.

86
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,860
It's a love story. It's a romance better than Twilight

*watches the møth go to the window*

88
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:48,500
Møth: Lämp I want you lamp

00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,120
Lämp: Møth we cannot be together

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,880
Moth: This window is only a temporary obstacle Lämp

91
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,060
Lämp:  It's not that

92
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,620
Møth: Then what is it

93
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,380
Lämp: The power is going out,

94
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,460
(Pewdiepie mourns this tragic turn of events) Møth: No Lämp.

95
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,040
Lämp: I am dying Møth.

96
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,540
*This should be a fanfiction*                 Møth: No Lämp you can not leave me ;C.

97
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:07,220
Lämp: You have to let me go Møth.

98
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,720
Møth: Do not give up on me Lämp.

101
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:17,709
I didn't think I would cry again on camera. Last time, it was Walking Dead.

102
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:22,630
Her: He's probably thinking about other girls. Him: lämp

103
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:31,030
Lämp. Are the Lämps ready brother? This meme started off from a reddit post which showed this

104
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:38,350
Horrific møth. I'm sorry to call him that. Close-up of møth outside my window Jesus Christ.

105
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:43,930
but it also shows an expression, a side of møth that we haven't seen before a

106
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:48,810
Humanizing of the møth. *oooh, we're poetic and artistic now* Usually I see a møth and I just want to kill it now

107
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:52,470
I see a møth and I go that's a sexy møth. Oh, I'm sorry

108
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:57,400
Are we are we going to pretend that we're not attracted to møth all of a sudden.

109
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,200
Have you seen this? Huh?

110
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,820
Don't tell me you wouldn't smash that. Not convinced are you?

111
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:09,880
How about this image getting turned on by this image: preteen boys on the Internet 2010, and møth

112
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:16,080
You're lying. you're lying to yourself. If you don't think møths are attractive. Don't look at me like that

113
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:22,120
You fapped to Bowsette, didn't you you weirdo you see you just add the math to the moth

114
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,000
It all make sense.

115
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,700
big titty møth girlfriend.

116
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,300
Tell me, tell me honestly

117
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,860
What do you think of this?

118
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,440
Lämps are effing sick.

119
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:36,540
Change my mind. You can't. You just can't.

120
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:40,860
Hey, look, it's this meme again making its 4000th, four hundred millionth appearance

121
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:47,830
Do you want anything from Ikea? Lämp. Just give me a lämp. That's all I want. I can't hold on

122
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:50,169
Give me your hand

123
00:05:50,169 --> 00:05:57,240
First give me the lämp. That is so clever when you found out Paris is the city of lights

124
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,820
What is this 2012 2012 memes?

126

129
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:15,980
Buy the merch. Okay, guys Yaga mean light. Yeah

130
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:22,480
Get it cuz his name is light in there. It's probably too complex for you. The møth memes really are very

131
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:29,789
Complex. Møth: God I wish there were me poor moth. They just want lämp, and that's it. One day

132
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:32,380
I'm going to be a beautiful butterfly

133

THANOS MØTH

138
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,090
That's incredible. I like how the møth

139
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:51,280
The møth means a sort of a weird Ugandan. Lämp and brother, brother as a certain way of articulating

140
00:06:51,280 --> 00:07:01,060
Itself, it's a reminiscent to say the least, of better times. Hello, may I acquire the lämp?

141
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:04,820
*shaking lämp noises*

147
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:32,000
DID SOME LEPIDOPTERA JUST SAY LÄMP? oh, my gosh.

148
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:40,160
Like for free Honda EU2200i 2200-Watt120-Volt super quiet portable inverter generator

149

00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,760
Lämp-lämp

157
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:22,240
Lämp brother so I've been trying to figure out this meme

158
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,380
but I don't get it like where's the punch line? *you can't talk, all of your punchlines are lämp*

159
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,500
2018 memes are just so confusing.

160
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:33,180
Lämp salesman: slaps top of lämp. Lämp salesman: slaps top of lämp again

161
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:36,509
Slaps top of lämp again. I like this one. It's clever.

162
00:08:36,509 --> 00:08:41,720
It's very. Good touching lämp because lämp is good. Dying because lämp is hot.

163
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:46,700
Perfectly balanced as all things should be. The møth meme

164
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:50,860
(Clap clap)

165
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:58,189
Gets extra 5 points for being disgusting. extra 10 points for being spoopy in spoop-tober

166
00:08:58,189 --> 00:09:00,290
mmm an extra

167
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:05,409
- five points for I don't know no reason and the result is

168
00:09:05,409 --> 00:09:06,319
(Clap, clap)

169
00:09:06,319 --> 00:09:07,550
7.5

170
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:09,800
Everybody. Wow, that's really good

171
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,120
Congratulations møth meme you scored very high on the meme review chart.

172
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,879
Hopefully you'll live a couple more days

173
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:20,629
The last meme of this week is the tik tok bad guys

174
00:09:20,629 --> 00:09:25,120
Now I can't show the actual audio because they'll just claim all the revenue on the video

175
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,529
and if I can't make money off of memes

176
00:09:27,529 --> 00:09:31,430
Then what's the point? Why would I even bother doing it?

177
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:36,670
So instead you'll get the copyright free PewDiePie singing version of this meme

178
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:40,449
Feel free to use this if you ever want to review it as well

179
00:09:40,449 --> 00:09:48,230
Why do good girls only like bad guys had this question for a real long time right bad?

180
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:51,680
40s going to see. You know,

181
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:58,300
Musical.ly died, but it's just like any other cancer it comes back in a different form. We were so happy

182
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:03,760
We were celebrating musical.ly is gone 
dododododododododo

183
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:09,940
but no it came back and it came back stronger than ever with tik tok

184
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:15,260
so now not just kids are posting, actual adults are posting these memes where they

185
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:22,160
Transform from this really good guy to this really cool bad guy with this cringy

186
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:29,880
Song in the background. I don't know what it is, but it goes like 'why do good girls only like bad guys...

187
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:36,030
...I had this question for a long time little bad for yet plain to see'

188
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:39,620
The wider world where love with me

189
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:46,820
What in the actual... The thing is like there's so many cringy ones that I can't tell which ones are joking or not

190
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:58,020
(De la musique)

191
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:01,840
Goddamn ads!!!!!

192
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,100
This meme gets

193
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,180
(The Clap that kills the memes)

194
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,900
-10 points for having

195
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:13,960
Copyrighted. Okay, stop using music in your memes, please. I guess another - I don't know

196
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:19,840
I don't like it. It gets a zero. Okay zero. That's right.

197
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,530
Oh!
That's enough

198
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:25,360
That's all the time we have for this week's meme review everybody!
