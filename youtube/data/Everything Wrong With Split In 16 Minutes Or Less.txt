1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:12,240
ooh I'm actually glad this is a pre

2
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,710
movie logo for a second there I thought

3
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:14,910
it was about to accidentally watch after

4
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,789
Earth Comcast 47 seconds of logos might

5
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:19,320
amount to restraint in the current movie

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,519
climate but it's still simplest man Anka

7
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:24,930
Taylor joy didn't even look this lonely

8
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,849
in the which that's what happens when

9
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:29,250
you do a mercy inmate so Casey is that

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,810
weird outsider girl that no one is

11
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:31,859
friends with where is this high school

12
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:33,480
where the misunderstood outsider girl is

13
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,070
also the hottest one I believe you

14
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,719
wanted to invite everyone dad I can't

15
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,430
invite everyone in my art class except

16
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:39,239
for one person

17
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:41,250
wait her art class was the only target

18
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,260
for invites is Claire in third grade how

19
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,899
do you I think she gets detention a lot

20
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:47,899
and she yells at teachers sometimes

21
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:49,710
expositional parenting this abduction

22
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:51,480
takes place outside a pretty crowded

23
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,280
strip mall in broad daylight but nobody

24
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,930
notices the lengthy attack on the father

25
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,699
or the incapacitation of three teenagers

26
00:00:56,699 --> 00:00:58,680
this is the one that he's so he's really

27
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,430
funny he does these weekly videos the

28
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:03,690
girl's final moments of freedom are

29
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,189
spent discovering the cinemasins YouTube

30
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:06,689
channel for the first time this mirror

31
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:08,250
is pointing severely downward and could

32
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,810
not be used for anything except building

33
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:11,729
suspense certainly not for driving if

34
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:13,200
Dennis shuts the trunk that would imply

35
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,610
that the confrontation with Claire's dad

36
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,560
has ended right so why does Casey see

37
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,119
nothing in the side mirror right after

38
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:19,619
the suspicious banging but sees the

39
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:21,299
spilled leftover is right after he shuts

40
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:23,220
the trunk did super clean freak Dennis

41
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,990
just kicked those to-go boxes over for

42
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,460
fun after he knocked out Claire's dad

43
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,320
also geez look at all those leftovers

44
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,049
didn't those girls eat anything no we're

45
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,430
going for suspense and the girls in the

46
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:33,990
back were absorbed in their phone but

47
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,090
dude was in the car for 30 seconds

48
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,740
before anyone says a fuckin word that is

49
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,420
entirely too many seconds

50
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,119
[Music]

51
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,770
okay several things here first off why

52
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:47,180
does he immediately take off the mask

53
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,890
after spraying the girls the knockout

54
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:50,390
juice was shot directly at Clara Marsha

55
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:52,490
sure but that's an airborne toxin and

56
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:54,440
this is a tightly closed sedan second

57
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,970
Dennis doesn't know anything about the

58
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:57,920
KC in the front seat but assume she'll

59
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,180
be chill enough to let him work through

60
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,009
some before he starts driving away third

61
00:02:01,009 --> 00:02:02,720
I assume everything in the abduct a

62
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,280
teenager handbook says you get the fuck

63
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,600
out of there immediately rather than

64
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,070
waste several seconds contemplating the

65
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,420
consciousness of the abducted teens

66
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,220
basically I'm saying this teenage

67
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,750
abduction in more ways than just regular

68
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,760
for this teenage abduction goddammit you

69
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,739
literally have your pinky on a lock your

70
00:02:15,739 --> 00:02:17,150
hand on the handle and he's not even

71
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:17,780
looking at you

72
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:23,780
green light Claire asked KC a series of

73
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,190
questions that there is no way for her

74
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,720
to know the answer to this movie is

75
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,400
really just an excuse to showcase Anja

76
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,080
Taylor Joey's ability to cry one tear at

77
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:36,560
a time and this elderly woman lives at

78
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,880
the top of a three-story walk-up

79
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,140
but isn't the slightest bit out of

80
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,730
breath when she walks in maybe she's a

81
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:43,160
superhero three students abducted the

82
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,630
father of one of the students woke up

83
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:46,700
dating King of Prussia he found the kids

84
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,829
and the car missing we every time we see

85
00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:50,209
Dennis used the sleep spray it takes a

86
00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:51,620
long fucking time for the victim to wake

87
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,540
up takes at least 30 minutes to get from

88
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,920
King of Prussia to the Philadelphia Zoo

89
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,570
and the girls woke up after Dennis threw

90
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:58,519
them in the cell so dad was just laid

91
00:02:58,519 --> 00:02:59,690
out in the middle of a crowded parking

92
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:01,190
lot until he woke up with no help

93
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,480
I knew Philly was a rough city and all

94
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,280
but damn this is an orgy of evidence

95
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,359
that this is a therapist's office

96
00:03:05,359 --> 00:03:07,790
Barcalounger for analysis check cases

97
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:08,720
full of books that look like they've

98
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,650
been read got it

99
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,630
weird gazelle looking artifact to spur

100
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,940
conversation sure I guess the subject of

101
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,799
Barry's email says we need you but when

102
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:17,239
dr. fletcher opens the email the subject

103
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:20,239
is re no subject I for one am excited

104
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:21,890
about the spin-off film no subject the

105
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:23,720
case of the missing email subject dr.

106
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,489
Fletcher has the most generic computer

107
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:27,470
desktop in history with no icons except

108
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,570
desktop and recycle bin I guess the only

109
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:31,040
way to get to email is to click on that

110
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,840
nondescript trapezoid on the bottom left

111
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,609
also this doctor apparently saves emails

112
00:03:34,609 --> 00:03:35,870
that were sent over four years before

113
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,489
this movie came out also even though

114
00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:38,750
some of these emails are clearly about

115
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,190
appointments and involve patients Perry

116
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,840
is the only name that has the last name

117
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,700
de-identified it doesn't

118
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,950
if you open that door clear there's a

119
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:48,290
second lock door right but if she's able

120
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:49,849
to unlock this door just by turning the

121
00:03:49,849 --> 00:03:51,590
lock knob with persistence who's to say

122
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,580
she can't do that again

123
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,560
we should drop a crazy-ass bomb on him

124
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,940
like make him watch The Last Airbender

125
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,890
all the way through also protagonists

126
00:03:57,890 --> 00:03:59,090
loudly planned escape when the

127
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:00,590
antagonist could easily be on the other

128
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:05,209
side of the door cliche of us is clear

129
00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:06,470
saying this because she and Marcia's

130
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,209
personalities are so indistinguishable

131
00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:09,200
from each other that they might as well

132
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,360
be the same person females are smarter

133
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,680
than the male's but you know that it's

134
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,290
like killings this dad is a good dad

135
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:17,120
which guaran-damn-tee is that he'll be

136
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,380
dead before the end of the movie maybe

137
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,060
Casey blank stares so much because she's

138
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,769
living half her life and expositional

139
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:24,830
flashbacks boys make too much noise yes

140
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,930
they do I'll let you know when I hear

141
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:28,130
something that makes sense

142
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:29,330
Casey knows just what to do in this

143
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:30,710
situation because she went deer hunting

144
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,300
that time that's supposed to be like

145
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,700
like a tailored jacket but I'm gonna

146
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,440
hand print it with newspaper headlines

147
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,450
so this is Dennis who's posing as Barry

148
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:40,070
and he's only there to UMP you skate the

149
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,570
abduction from Dr Fletcher because he

150
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:42,860
knows Barry sent her an email earlier

151
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,690
but if this is Dennis why does he not

152
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:46,190
only have Barry's accent but he also

153
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:48,020
knows about fashion dennis is supposed

154
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,280
to be a completely different personality

155
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,410
my point is this movie's explanation for

156
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:53,060
how these personalities interact does

157
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,310
work when I last spoke to them they

158
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:58,550
believed you were a model employee so

159
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:59,780
much so that they let you live in an

160
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,880
underground ping bunker on site does

161
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,820
anybody care about us yes the University

162
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,560
of Paris has asked me to do a lecture in

163
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,530
fact people are believing more because

164
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:10,910
they're rejecting the idea that you need

165
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,310
evidence and stuff also listen even if I

166
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,510
ignore the controversy about

167
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,370
dissociative identity disorder being

168
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:18,710
real diagnoseable pathology there is

169
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:20,090
certainly very little evidence of it

170
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:21,830
being a dangerous disorder except you

171
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,479
know outside of a universe created by

172
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:25,070
the same dude that did the happening I'm

173
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,240
gonna take this part of the movie with

174
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,340
the biggest grain of salt ever created I

175
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,810
actually watched your sketches Barry

176
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:31,970
you're usually very protective of them

177
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:33,289
even though dr. Fletcher is pretty sure

178
00:05:33,289 --> 00:05:34,820
Barry's not Barry this prompts her to do

179
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,650
nothing until he emails her again they

180
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:39,380
always use your thumbs flick it flick it

181
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,210
I'm not entirely sure these two elderly

182
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:42,700
women are wanting porn

183
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,500
yep I don't know how you work with those

184
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,050
people what people your patients that's

185
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:50,690
pissed I don't believe it yeah no

186
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:51,169
offense

187
00:05:51,169 --> 00:05:52,789
this was Barrett's exact response to

188
00:05:52,789 --> 00:05:54,229
everyone who said no really split is

189
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:55,669
good man you would totally love it he

190
00:05:55,669 --> 00:05:57,050
expects me to believe that these three

191
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:57,470
girls

192
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:58,820
are all able to see through the crack in

193
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,020
the door at the same time even though

194
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,010
Marsha is looking at the back of

195
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:02,600
Claire's head and KC is crouching near

196
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,190
the center of the door also that they're

197
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,030
looking through the crack whines

198
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:06,830
Patricia's head obscured because it's

199
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,240
more interesting to reveal the Patricia

200
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,320
and Dennis are actually the same person

201
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,140
when he opens the door way this movie is

202
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,130
set up the only time the other

203
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:14,540
identities don't know what each other is

204
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,100
doing depends solely on the convenience

205
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,170
of the plot he's not allowed to touch

206
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:20,630
him not only is it rarely diagnosed it's

207
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,820
super rare for people with tid to not

208
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,560
only have the means but time to play

209
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,910
dress up for every single fucking

210
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:27,770
personality well were they open this

211
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:30,110
time with the new evidence you submitted

212
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:32,150
video of a dog acting differently to one

213
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,890
of your patients at different time with

214
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:35,780
the over 600 patients our filing cabinet

215
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,250
suggested you'd think she'd be able to

216
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,450
muster up better evidence than that

217
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:40,130
speak of them like they're super

218
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:42,290
naturally gifted like like they have

219
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,630
powers or something Porsche arguing we

220
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:48,800
have brain scans now D ID patients have

221
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,110
changed their body chemistry with their

222
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:52,880
thoughts I'm guessing she didn't have

223
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,020
that evidence before the due date

224
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,610
forcing her to send the dog video

225
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:57,350
instead also it's telling that I would

226
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,300
much more easily accept being exposed to

227
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,070
gamma radiation or being bitten by a

228
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,810
super spider or being a bioengineer

229
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:05,090
raccoon as a more plausible origin for a

230
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:07,250
superhuman story than this Jesus even

231
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,750
for a doctor this is some unintelligible

232
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,190
handwriting and there's no chance

233
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,330
Fletcher would be able to get any

234
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:16,070
information from her own notes as a

235
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,810
nine-year-old Hedwig loves to play games

236
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:19,310
and one of his favorites is the pronoun

237
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:24,020
game not the lady what are you bloody

238
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,090
hey nobody for that SATs considering you

239
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:27,530
all know you live in the same person's

240
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,450
body and you know you're stuck inside

241
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:30,530
one person's head

242
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:32,000
I stole a light from mr. Dennis but

243
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,830
he'll be back real soon and you'll know

244
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:36,290
and get angry and they're aware of each

245
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:39,620
other but mr. Dennis he said that he

246
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,360
followed those two girls for four days

247
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,190
so we're Marcia and Claire together for

248
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,870
four days or did Dennis follow Claire

249
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:47,240
and Patricia follow Marcia wait also if

250
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,740
he was stalking them why did he pick the

251
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,030
moment after the birthday party when

252
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:51,620
another girl and Claire's dad was with

253
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:54,850
them to finally abduct them

254
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:57,410
come the fuck gone we just saw Hedwig in

255
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,510
full Hedwig costume walk away so it took

256
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,400
less than 13 seconds for him to change

257
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,860
mentally and Sartori into Denis this Zoo

258
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,390
just happens to have human size ductwork

259
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:07,040
to properly regulate the temperature of

260
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,570
this underground bunker cleaner should

261
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:09,800
have known she'd be caught after hiding

262
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,120
him what is clearly Davy Jones locker

263
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,820
could you swim it's it's ruined it's

264
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:18,110
dirty because we have hot teenage girls

265
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,400
in our movie and we're gonna make the

266
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,400
most of it dammit so why didn't you put

267
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,450
them in different cells in the first

268
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:24,950
place there's obviously plenty of room

269
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,960
and a guy as fastidious as Dennis should

270
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,070
know that it's more difficult to deal

271
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,600
with three versus one in an enclosed

272
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,630
area take off your skirt take off your

273
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:37,070
shirt what's casually played as one of

274
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:38,570
Dennis's pervy character traits is

275
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:40,100
another cheap excuse for the filmmaker

276
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,720
to add a little disturbing sex appeal to

277
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,760
this movie the differences in the

278
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,670
identities can be dramatic so much so

279
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:47,720
that they feel the need to dress up

280
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,400
individually so movie goers can easily

281
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,860
distinguish them have these individuals

282
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:55,160
through their suffering unlocked the

283
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,130
potential of the brain no Jay what

284
00:08:58,130 --> 00:08:59,870
health-conscious fast-food purveyor did

285
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,280
you originally solicit to buy these

286
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,930
chicken wings you've so lovingly

287
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:05,120
reheated in a minor suicidal gesture

288
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,470
goddamn em Knight was apparently

289
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:07,880
possessed by Aaron Sorkin for a minute

290
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,070
so look around 3:18 M night Shyamalan

291
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:12,080
continues his Hitchcockian desire to

292
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,550
have a cameo in all of his movies only

293
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:15,140
this time his character is Hitchcockian

294
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,610
hacker who ving hooters

295
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:19,250
what are you object in us or is it

296
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,740
Patricia who's deciding things oh we can

297
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,600
make up all new personalities like the

298
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,620
ones that were casually mentioned

299
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,510
previously in the therapy office Glenda

300
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:28,730
LeBron Aloysius what are those assholes

301
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:31,310
up to I'm not gonna die I mean I'm not

302
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:32,960
gonna dock there sorry I said we there

303
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,430
cuz there's no fucking way you survive

304
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:37,280
this it's good let's go back pre-k in it

305
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,690
dammit as much as I'm bagging on this

306
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:39,920
movie for having a ridiculous premise

307
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,810
James McAvoy's performance it's awesome

308
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:43,610
I'll take a sin off for Dennis another

309
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:45,410
for Patricia and half a cent for Hedwig

310
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:46,910
because it's good acting but he's still

311
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,620
kind of annoys me I've had that Asian

312
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,310
people's music

313
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:52,370
aids digestion citation needed of all

314
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:54,200
the potentially lethal or incapacitating

315
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,880
items in this kitchen Marcia goes with

316
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,740
the clunky folding chair which is a 100%

317
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,810
rate of ineptitude both in movies and

318
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:02,750
WWE events so the Beast is a legendary

319
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,580
figure in Kevin's mind but Hedwig says

320
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,750
he's done terrible things to people

321
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,000
before does he mean an act while

322
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,980
because Kevin Berry's been chillin at

323
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,689
this job for 10 years and Fletcher's

324
00:10:11,689 --> 00:10:13,459
never met the Beast so when that

325
00:10:13,459 --> 00:10:16,040
happened yeah every one of us has to

326
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:20,720
wait in a chair and Harry he decides who

327
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,459
stand in the light if all the

328
00:10:22,459 --> 00:10:23,720
personalities are sitting in chairs

329
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,100
waiting for their turn in the light then

330
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,240
what the fuck are they doing in the

331
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:26,779
meantime

332
00:10:26,779 --> 00:10:28,040
they all have fidget spinners or

333
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,389
something to keep them occupied what

334
00:10:29,389 --> 00:10:31,040
sure may indeed be a doctor but the only

335
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,629
degree we're clearly shown here is I

336
00:10:32,629 --> 00:10:34,339
masters so I'm calling into question her

337
00:10:34,339 --> 00:10:36,439
qualifications also Tulane University's

338
00:10:36,439 --> 00:10:38,209
obviously a made-up school anyway

339
00:10:38,209 --> 00:10:40,339
can I guess that you emailed me in the

340
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:42,040
middle of the night due to

341
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,050
garden-variety issues and dr. flicker is

342
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:46,699
the anti Sherlock she's seen the news

343
00:10:46,699 --> 00:10:48,110
reports of the girls that were taken on

344
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:49,730
the same day Barry emailed her she also

345
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:51,319
knows Dennis and Patricia support this

346
00:10:51,319 --> 00:10:52,730
terrible piece character and that

347
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:54,379
they're likely at the wheel here and yet

348
00:10:54,379 --> 00:10:56,420
she hasn't done jack don't lurk the

349
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,160
police or a colleague or anyone that

350
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,209
could be helpful in figuring out if

351
00:10:59,209 --> 00:11:01,129
there's a link to the girls she's just

352
00:11:01,129 --> 00:11:02,569
been jacking off with him night while

353
00:11:02,569 --> 00:11:03,529
eating hooters

354
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:05,660
you and Patricia have never met the

355
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,910
Beast that's because he's not an altar

356
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,410
uh-huh-huh case closed

357
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:11,149
nice job Karen let's wrap this up and

358
00:11:11,149 --> 00:11:12,379
head down to Applebee's while it's still

359
00:11:12,379 --> 00:11:13,639
a happy hour hang on

360
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:15,379
does every altar get their own room and

361
00:11:15,379 --> 00:11:17,480
if so how efficient is that there were

362
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,160
23 of them and Barry has the light the

363
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,779
majority of the time so is he supposed

364
00:11:20,779 --> 00:11:22,519
to clean up all their feed the gerbils

365
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:24,529
etc just dance is equal parts hilarious

366
00:11:24,529 --> 00:11:26,029
and terrifying making it essentially at

367
00:11:26,029 --> 00:11:31,300
Drake music video with two other girls

368
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:34,699
tell my Sarge he falls I would be angry

369
00:11:34,699 --> 00:11:36,139
at this stupid dick on the other side of

370
00:11:36,139 --> 00:11:37,339
the line that doesn't care about a

371
00:11:37,339 --> 00:11:38,689
distress call but I'm more annoyed that

372
00:11:38,689 --> 00:11:40,069
this asshole hasn't returned those

373
00:11:40,069 --> 00:11:41,750
orange picking headphones it's becoming

374
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,220
clear that Dennis is real superhuman

375
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,329
power is the ability to completely

376
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:46,339
change outfits this time in twenty one

377
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:49,610
King seconds this is a sentient creature

378
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:52,160
who represents the highest form of

379
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,470
humans evolution or on your Taylor joy

380
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:55,910
always getting involved with godlike

381
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,529
figures that demand personal sacrifice

382
00:11:57,529 --> 00:11:58,879
Jesus try a comedy

383
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:00,649
he believes the time of ordinary

384
00:12:00,649 --> 00:12:02,870
humanity is over wait are we talking

385
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:04,339
about the same beast that's one of the

386
00:12:04,339 --> 00:12:06,199
x-men and the one that helped Charles

387
00:12:06,199 --> 00:12:07,670
Xavier all those years when he looked a

388
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:09,559
lot like Dennis I was gonna ask for your

389
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:12,529
last shirt but what I want because it

390
00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:13,879
needs to be slowly ripped off her if she

391
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:15,530
tries to escape later

392
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:17,750
the email received sound was what got

393
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,370
Fletcher over to look at the screen but

394
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:21,020
that's been going on for the last 15

395
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,760
minutes and she just heard it we're very

396
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,520
similar we are very similar you and I

397
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:30,680
cliche I'm a huge advocate for people

398
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,060
with mental health issues getting good

399
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,220
jobs in fact it's a great thing but even

400
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,570
people without severe psychiatric

401
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:36,950
illnesses should be looked at

402
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:38,630
suspiciously if they live underground in

403
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,190
a fucking Zoo especially if they work

404
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:42,320
they're brought about a woman in Germany

405
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,140
who'd been blind for ten years then

406
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:48,290
three of her identities develop sight

407
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:51,170
optical nerves regenerated because of

408
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,300
her beliefs discoveries like this dr.

409
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,230
Fletcher should just leave the

410
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:55,730
therapeutic field and dive straight into

411
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:56,870
the clergy

412
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,010
[Music]

413
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,960
what does that mean I don't understand

414
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,490
dr. Fletcher would be excellent at

415
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:02,150
cinemasins

416
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:05,930
who are you going to meet damn it they

417
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:06,920
were about to get through this entire

418
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,180
vague conversation without playing

419
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,040
another pronoun game we need to get out

420
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,990
of these rooms Clare who was the first

421
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:13,520
to try and escape certain death fifty

422
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,260
movie minutes ago suddenly remembers she

423
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,700
still means to escape certain death

424
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,440
oh good Casey finally found Kevin's hard

425
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,450
drive of exposition this air box says

426
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:22,100
unable to connect to the internet even

427
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,420
though the Wi-Fi signal at the bottom

428
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,160
right shows full bars and there's no

429
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,540
indication that there is no internet

430
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,850
connection that this even sort of works

431
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,230
Fletcher mentioned earlier that the

432
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:31,730
Beast hypothetically lived in a train

433
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:33,140
yard since Kevin's dad was probably

434
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,970
killed by mr. glass and unbreakable but

435
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:36,080
why does Kevin need to use this

436
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,700
particular train damn orphan a beastie

437
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,140
other than providing ample time for the

438
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,180
girls to try to escape yeah when you see

439
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,830
a tough D ID case like this there's

440
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,540
always one asshole personality that has

441
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,980
to be addressed by his last name

442
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,839
looking at you mr. Prichard Dennis finds

443
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,220
a completely empty train car with the

444
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,810
lights ominously turned off for him to

445
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:56,570
unleash the beast but could you know

446
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,220
this this can't be the first multiple

447
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,930
personality turns supernatural serial

448
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:01,040
cannibal case you've worked right

449
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,780
detective Dooley Fletcher has the

450
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,250
wherewithal to write Kevin's full name

451
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,810
down but isn't able to say it out loud

452
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:07,610
which has a much better shot of making

453
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:09,050
the captive girls aware of it more like

454
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:11,210
vanes McAvoy am i right the Beast loves

455
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:12,740
doctor Fletcher enough that he cuddles

456
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,310
her to death

457
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,660
okay even if this is a supernatural

458
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,339
cannibal beast thing might just eat a

459
00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:17,780
little bit of the midsection and leave

460
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:19,520
almost the entirety of delicious Marcia

461
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,260
meat lying on the floor

462
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,000
there have now been two savage murders

463
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,590
in Casey has heard screams from neither

464
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,860
of them

465
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,670
Claire carpaccio

466
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:30,230
yeah it's creepy and everything but does

467
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:31,520
the Beast really need to be crawling on

468
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,960
the walls right now to get to Casey or

469
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,820
is he just showing the fuck off holy Sh

470
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,320
for a guy that just eviscerated two

471
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,850
teenagers Kevin's hands are amazingly

472
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:41,360
blood free and kill me what I said it

473
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,650
would be goddamn devastating for the

474
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:44,750
alters to hear Kevin's full name so if

475
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,670
it's so powerful why does only last less

476
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:50,900
than two minutes again oh girl Kevin is

477
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,940
asleep why doesn't sing that name work

478
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,620
after the first time because M night

479
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,910
says it doesn't work out at the first

480
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,920
time mother even though he could easily

481
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,600
kill her the Beast prefers to Padme

482
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:05,060
Casey shirt for future viewing let's

483
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,890
talk about the beasts plan he wants to

484
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:08,750
rid the world of the untouched but why

485
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,490
this is just a tiny twist on horror

486
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:12,080
movies always focused on killing the

487
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,330
converging that turn show the world how

488
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,970
powerful it can be powerful enough to

489
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:18,320
convince the movie studio to make a

490
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,300
sequel just like that crazy guy in the

491
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,310
wheelchair that they put away 15 years

492
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:24,620
ago awesome apparently no other weird

493
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,000
murders have happened in metropolitan

494
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,350
Philadelphia over the last 15 years

495
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:29,180
