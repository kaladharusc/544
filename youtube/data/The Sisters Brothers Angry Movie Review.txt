[Music]

2
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:14,459
we got ourselves a good old western here

3
00:00:14,459 --> 00:00:17,610
we went out and saw the sisters brothers

4
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:22,040
that's right brothers whose last name is

5
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,310
sisters

6
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,100
that's the sisters brothers just look

7
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,920
you understand

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,870
well we didn't want to see night school

9
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:36,420
trailer and they were pretty unfunny I

10
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:37,500
don't know some of the later trailers

11
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,629
got pretty funny but I don't know I just

12
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:41,790
heard it was bad so we went out and saw

13
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,500
the sisters brothers which is another

14
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,230
one of these sort of very limited

15
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:50,629
release but it also just like Mandy is

16
00:00:50,629 --> 00:00:53,010
available apparently for streaming right

17
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,260
now so if you want to just watch this at

18
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,629
home you can I don't know if it's all

19
00:00:57,629 --> 00:00:59,280
over but I know for sure it's on video

20
00:00:59,280 --> 00:00:59,940
voodoo

21
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,329
so you can rent it there um and I was in

22
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:07,590
the mood for a Western because coming up

23
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,740
here soon we got Red Dead Redemption -

24
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,709
in the video game world so and plus I

25
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:17,910
love westerns already so this one you

26
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:19,860
want to describe the plotline

27
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,819
oh yeah the two brothers they work for

28
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:27,300
kind of a bad guy they're they're

29
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,520
they're the muscle of the of the West

30
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,709
and they go around and they they hunt

31
00:01:31,709 --> 00:01:32,970
people down who have wronged their

32
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,640
Commodore mm-hmm mad dysfunctional yeah

33
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,380
and so there's a lot of like interesting

34
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,810
brotherly antics that that happen and

35
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:43,020
these were played by john c reilly and

36
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,679
joaquin phoenix yeah and i gotta say the

37
00:01:46,679 --> 00:01:49,700
chemistry between these two fantastic

38
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,929
though i think the film kind of leans a

39
00:01:51,929 --> 00:01:54,060
little bit more on Riley's performance

40
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,759
and he he does a damn good job really

41
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:00,000
great actor you know like I believe

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,520
there's an unspoken long sort of between

43
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,640
these two brothers and it's really

44
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,110
engaging the film opens up on a nice gun

45
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,849
fight scene filmed in a way I didn't

46
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:13,980
really say it kind of keeps you a little

47
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,500
cold and distance from the gunfight you

48
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,140
just the knight is pierced by a bunch of

49
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,630
gunfire and

50
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:24,350
you know I thought certain segments of

51
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:26,630
the film were filmed really really

52
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,520
nicely there was some awkwardness I

53
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,810
think there's some I like so I like a

54
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:31,430
lot of the shots but they definitely

55
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,990
tried some new things there's a lot of

56
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:36,290
like intense close-ups on the face and

57
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:38,350
so it's kind of filmed filmed in a

58
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:41,030
peculiar way yeah I think it was trying

59
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,310
to sort of try to buck some of the old

60
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:45,440
Western trends this is definitely not

61
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,910
your traditional Western there the the

62
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,770
soundtrack is a little kind of awkward

63
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:55,160
you know but effective for what what

64
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,730
this is here and we have a subplot by

65
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,350
two characters you're going to take that

66
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:03,530
subplot so here we have another guest

67
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:05,600
star Jake Gyllenhaal

68
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,700
oh yeah there's a good actor yeah like I

69
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,960
didn't know all these people were

70
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,120
actually gonna be in this movie I didn't

71
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,190
know anything about this the casting was

72
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,440
pretty good my part yeah and they met up

73
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,740
with a scientist guy who was doing like

74
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,890
some gold rush yeah so he also was like

75
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:24,410
a mercenary he was sent out to go track

76
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:26,060
down the guy with the formula bring back

77
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,730
before that guy and the Commodore wanted

78
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:31,580
basically the formula to unveil the gold

79
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:34,640
which is pretty cool but Jake Gyllenhaal

80
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,450
had a change of heart and these two guys

81
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:43,310
actually shit oh did we do before late

82
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:45,740
Fox all right well then let's go back a

83
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:48,950
little bit and go ahead so this

84
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:50,810
character Jake Gyllenhaal he's also a

85
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:53,630
mercenary he set out to go get the Scout

86
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,700
with the formula and he meets up and

87
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:59,240
kind of waits for their sisters brothers

88
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:04,250
to show up because these sister brothers

89
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,080
they're basically assassins they don't

90
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,900
care whether you're you know good

91
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,400
innocent bad it doesn't really matter to

92
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,530
them and we get a kind of a surprisingly

93
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,970
endearing storyline or an interesting

94
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:19,430
storyline between these two men talking

95
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:22,400
about you know what what you know what

96
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,610
exactly he's gonna do with this this

97
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:27,530
formula what it's going to bring him and

98
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,840
he's maybe trying to convince the Scout

99
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,760
a little bit not to you know take the

100
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,849
the obvious approach and

101
00:04:33,849 --> 00:04:35,949
got these two parallel storylines that

102
00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:38,020
that are eventually going to collide

103
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,599
you've got the sort of high jinks

104
00:04:40,599 --> 00:04:44,830
and you know killing you know the

105
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:47,559
sisters brothers and then you have you

106
00:04:47,559 --> 00:04:50,800
know this scientist and Scout scatter

107
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,449
store line going on and eventually these

108
00:04:52,449 --> 00:04:57,099
things collide and and I think it's kind

109
00:04:57,099 --> 00:04:59,129
of like a chase movie in that regard and

110
00:04:59,129 --> 00:05:02,469
it was long you know about your hours

111
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:05,499
yeah and and the pacing sometimes feels

112
00:05:05,499 --> 00:05:08,949
a little meandering maybe a little kind

113
00:05:08,949 --> 00:05:11,259
of confused a little bit on its tone as

114
00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:13,539
it tries to do some experimental things

115
00:05:13,539 --> 00:05:17,349
in westerns we get some kind of black

116
00:05:17,349 --> 00:05:20,860
comedy we get some sort of dream

117
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,080
sequence kind of shots that I don't know

118
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,669
I almost don't kind of really very well

119
00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:26,050
like I said there was weird there's some

120
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,339
scenes in there that were like really

121
00:05:27,339 --> 00:05:29,349
great that fit the Western theme and

122
00:05:29,349 --> 00:05:30,459
then there was a scene that didn't make

123
00:05:30,459 --> 00:05:33,009
sense at all and they he didn't like

124
00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:34,929
repeat the same kind of theme throughout

125
00:05:34,929 --> 00:05:36,519
the movie he just tried something once

126
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:38,259
and like throated yeah that's in the

127
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:40,479
film eventually these two plot lines

128
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,959
crash and and they're satisfying

129
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:46,539
gunfights obviously the sister brothers

130
00:05:46,539 --> 00:05:48,779
they're very good at their job and

131
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:51,669
ultimately I would say that this is a

132
00:05:51,669 --> 00:05:55,839
sadist an engaging Western I don't know

133
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,339
if I can recommend it to everybody

134
00:05:57,339 --> 00:05:59,199
because it was kind of uh no I don't

135
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,800
think yeah like to me it was very story

136
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,289
driven like the chemistry was great and

137
00:06:05,289 --> 00:06:08,469
you feel that like transit bomb way and

138
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:11,409
I really enjoyed that part but it's not

139
00:06:11,409 --> 00:06:13,179
one of these shoot them up kind of thing

140
00:06:13,179 --> 00:06:15,969
it's not a typical Western alright you

141
00:06:15,969 --> 00:06:17,559
have to be not only do you have to like

142
00:06:17,559 --> 00:06:19,149
this kind of movie you have to be in the

143
00:06:19,149 --> 00:06:21,189
mood for it like this is not a movie

144
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:23,889
that you want to like you want a rush to

145
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:25,240
go see cuz you have a bunch of stuff to

146
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,069
do in the day like this is you want to

147
00:06:27,069 --> 00:06:29,349
sit back back on enjoy this is this

148
00:06:29,349 --> 00:06:31,569
movie like goes that like a mozi rat

149
00:06:31,569 --> 00:06:33,939
like there's nothing on yeah it's real

150
00:06:33,939 --> 00:06:36,279
it's all really engaging I liked it I

151
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:37,899
look at em except the way but I knew

152
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:39,610
what I was getting into and I like that

153
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:41,319
kind of movie and it would be hard for

154
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:43,329
me to go and say everyone should go see

155
00:06:43,329 --> 00:06:44,949
this movie because a lawgiver hated

156
00:06:44,949 --> 00:06:47,260
right if you like westerns

157
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,180
if you like westerns if you're preparing

158
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,190
yourself a Red Dead because it actually

159
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:53,230
has a lot of similarities with Red Dead

160
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:56,380
in the sense that this is later on in in

161
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,320
in sort of late western period

162
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,240
technologies starting to come about they

163
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,490
they do some jokes with two brushes or

164
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,800
do some jokes with San Francisco and all

165
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,530
the fanciness it's in San Francisco and

166
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:11,770
sort of the grim life of being an

167
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:15,700
assassin the the eventualities the you

168
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:19,060
know potential danger it is and just

169
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,980
going around and killing people because

170
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,900
when you kill somebody like they say in

171
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,700
the movie that's not the end of it you

172
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,320
know there are brothers there are

173
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,500
fathers that people come after you and

174
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,750
so that is dealt with in the movie and I

175
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,940
thought it was dope pretty well I didn't

176
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:36,280
expect the ending the ending I I think

177
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,090
the film

178
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:40,420
here's three-fourths of this film was

179
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,250
fantastic to me okay

180
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,590
I've seen much worse westerns because I

181
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:47,350
love westerns i watch a bunch of them on

182
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:49,870
netflix that are terrible this one you

183
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:52,120
know cinematography great direction

184
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,510
great acting great storyline gray but i

185
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:59,800
do think in that that last fourth you

186
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,620
know it kind of falls apart because you

187
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,600
have the characters doing stupid things

188
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,690
yeah like like why would you do that it

189
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:10,320
almost feels forced in order to create

190
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,510
some kind of conflict or drama here

191
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,500
that's shocking

192
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,740
yes its abrupt yes life in in the West

193
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,140
is not a forgiving thing this kind of

194
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:23,590
reminds me of hostels listen is bleak

195
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:26,740
though well it was really rough I can

196
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:29,230
recommend this one over hostels in in a

197
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:31,330
sense of you know Joe am I gonna is

198
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:33,070
gonna be so morose that I'm gonna be

199
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:35,290
kind of you know in depression after

200
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:37,930
watching it know this one is actually

201
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:41,110
you know better than that so in that

202
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:43,360
sense but yeah so they did some stupid

203
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,560
things at the end and I'm like I'm not

204
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,320
really sure I buy these smart characters

205
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,850
at least a few smart characters reduce

206
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:52,690
you know some things like that so and I

207
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:55,120
have to hold off for a quick spoiler

208
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,700
section but overall I felt the film was

209
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,740
very satisfying if you want a Western

210
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,899
you're gearing up for Red Dead - and

211
00:09:02,899 --> 00:09:04,790
you've blown through a lot of westerns

212
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:08,269
that are on Netflix I'll recommend what

213
00:09:08,269 --> 00:09:08,809
is it

214
00:09:08,809 --> 00:09:11,300
Silverado you can go and watch that on

215
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,999
that one's probably a more mainstream

216
00:09:12,999 --> 00:09:15,319
satisfying kind of Western if you

217
00:09:15,319 --> 00:09:16,999
haven't seen that one but once you go

218
00:09:16,999 --> 00:09:18,559
through a lot of the westerns that

219
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:20,240
people have already seen tombstone and

220
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,949
things like that and you're looking for

221
00:09:21,949 --> 00:09:25,490
of devil whores yeah we saw this

222
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:28,249
crazy-ass thing in between the previews

223
00:09:28,249 --> 00:09:30,379
at Alamo we want to look it up we don't

224
00:09:30,379 --> 00:09:34,100
know what it's about but its 1930 serial

225
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:37,339
anyways you know so this one is gonna be

226
00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:39,980
one of those for fans of westerns who

227
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:43,160
want something different and and the

228
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,709
characters ultimately pull you in the

229
00:09:45,709 --> 00:09:49,730
story pulls you in and you know I'm not

230
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:51,860
mad that we went to go see it in the

231
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:54,589
theaters but I would recommend for you

232
00:09:54,589 --> 00:09:56,689
guys if you go see it don't bother with

233
00:09:56,689 --> 00:09:58,429
the theaters you could stay at home and

234
00:09:58,429 --> 00:10:01,939
watch it here and relax you know and

235
00:10:01,939 --> 00:10:05,059
kind of take in the the Western imagery

236
00:10:05,059 --> 00:10:08,240
and get prepared to do cuz I'm gonna

237
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,220
kick your ass and red date online anyway

238
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,350
alright guys so let's go with a final

239
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:15,259
verdict let's go Joe first alright

240
00:10:15,259 --> 00:10:17,569
the casting was when I first saw the

241
00:10:17,569 --> 00:10:19,550
casting Joaquin Phoenix John see you

242
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:21,170
around the music what the hell pretty

243
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:22,550
good you look at john c reilly and

244
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:25,339
you're like i do i buy him in a not a

245
00:10:25,339 --> 00:10:28,639
funny role no but he pulled it off join

246
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:31,939
us and jake gyllenhaal was great as well

247
00:10:31,939 --> 00:10:36,230
the story was great but i think to me

248
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:39,709
this story this was too realistic mm-hmm

249
00:10:39,709 --> 00:10:43,309
like he filmed every scene and like the

250
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,259
whole hardship and everything it was

251
00:10:45,259 --> 00:10:46,999
just too much yeah

252
00:10:46,999 --> 00:10:49,069
I felt like alright we need to start

253
00:10:49,069 --> 00:10:51,170
winding down and like wrapping up the

254
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:56,749
movie I did kind of give Joe like you

255
00:10:56,749 --> 00:10:58,699
know sign a little bit like you know

256
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:00,529
kind of rustling in his chair towards

257
00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:02,089
the end and I'm like really could've

258
00:11:02,089 --> 00:11:07,309
knocked off like 20 minutes so I'm gonna

259
00:11:07,309 --> 00:11:10,429
give this a 6 ok okay that's fair I also

260
00:11:10,429 --> 00:11:13,370
felt that there was this is kind of shot

261
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:14,540
it's like two three

262
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,550
weeks a period of time and a lot of

263
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,740
really bad things happen to these guys

264
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,600
not just for being an assassin just for

265
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,450
travelling like there's animal attacks a

266
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:25,370
couple of them I mean there's all these

267
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:26,840
like hardships that show up and it's

268
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,340
kind of relentless in the sense it's

269
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:31,040
like I almost don't buy that this much

270
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,070
bad stuff happened I mean I think that's

271
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:36,380
hospitals you're describing well like

272
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,660
that there well we'll talk about it

273
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,250
there's a lot of bad stuff to happen

274
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,560
these guys and after the final one

275
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,240
happens it's like I'm done like stopping

276
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,280
there was also some conveniences in the

277
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,810
writing where there's like we need a way

278
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:50,780
to wrap this up oh I know let's and you

279
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:51,950
mention this before it's like let's kind

280
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:53,720
of have characters act out of character

281
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,460
yeah and then let's wrap it up real

282
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:57,290
nicely so then everything so we have

283
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:58,730
this like really nice because it ends

284
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:01,370
you know it's it's it's kind of nicely

285
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:03,190
god damn it Alex

286
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:07,640
but dog don't say that ready angle so V

287
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,220
there was some conveniences and in the

288
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:13,460
writing it was based on a 2011 book yeah

289
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,500
but I imagine when you're reading the

290
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,150
book they had more time to flesh out

291
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,980
where you're like okay I buy the kitties

292
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,590
care I think there's an epilogue in the

293
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:23,600
book and they included it in the movie

294
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,490
and maybe the movie could have done

295
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:28,280
without the ability if it depends on

296
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,680
what kind of tone they're going for but

297
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,070
I like this kind of film there this is

298
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:35,180
there's not a lot of action in this film

299
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,320
I mean there's a couple little but

300
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,700
they're short like the well short action

301
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,370
scenes and so if you're ready for a good

302
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:42,500
story that's really slow I think this is

303
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,770
a great choice I mean it's a seven okay

304
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:48,650
yeah I agree 100% I want to give it more

305
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:51,890
but because of that that that last three

306
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:54,560
for that last fourth of the film where

307
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,210
characters are at would stick around for

308
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:58,040
spoilers we could tell you about it but

309
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,620
so it's hard for me to recommend outside

310
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,540
of Western fans or people that are

311
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,800
prepping themselves for Red Dead

312
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,080
Redemption too and if you want to watch

313
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,540
some old classics that's fine but this

314
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:11,600
one is uh it's definitely more character

315
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,490
focused character study between these

316
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:14,090
two brothers

317
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:16,160
you really do buy the relationship but I

318
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,660
think some things happen by the end that

319
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,670
you like was that really necessary it

320
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,830
kind of made kind of a whole plotline

321
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:25,640
seem a little you know pointless but not

322
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,040
really because you know

323
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,560
characters grow from anyways we'll talk

324
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,570
to you in spoilers thank you guys so

325
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:35,930
much for watching it oh shit I gave it a

326
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:38,690
7 out of 10 and my choice I agreed with

327
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:41,630
them already so 7 out of 10 that's it

2

332
00:13:47,310 --> 00:14:02,570
[Laughter]

333
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:05,670
all right welcome guys so the biggest

334
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:07,410
problem I had with the film like

335
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:09,540
everybody was acting realistically i

336
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,730
buyed that these these two guys are

337
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:14,430
really good at gun fights and because

338
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:15,660
they've been doing it their whole lives

339
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:18,120
they talk about how their father's blood

340
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,010
is in him and he was like a fucking

341
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:22,980
shitty ass person and you can tell that

342
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,600
you know they bonded from that

343
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,240
experience growing up and so I bought

344
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,670
all of that they go and they hunt down

345
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,290
they're supposed to hunt down the

346
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:33,390
scientists with the formula and torture

347
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:35,760
him to get the formula turns out the

348
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,070
Scout who you know is supposed to tattle

349
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:41,430
on him you know meets him and befriends

350
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:43,320
him and realizes he's very you know he's

351
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,780
a nice guy well-spoken and they have

352
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:48,150
some things in common and they decide to

353
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:51,000
create a convent or not a convent but a

354
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,210
community in Dallas with the gold that

355
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:56,480
they're gonna you know harvest together

356
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,830
eventually these plot lines you know

357
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:02,910
come together and the the sisters

358
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:05,580
brothers end up joining them we don't

359
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:08,100
work for Commodore anymore because the

360
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,840
the two guys get the jump on the sister

361
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,820
brothers but we don't work for them

362
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,800
anymore so they go and they use the

363
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,560
solution in the water to you know show

364
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,900
the gold but then they act like fucking

365
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,570
idiots even though they know because

366
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:23,850
they've used it multiple times that this

367
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:27,480
solution is very toxic and hazardous to

368
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,090
your health and we got people just for

369
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:32,370
no apparent reason grabbing big fucking

370
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:34,470
you know what keen Phoenix of course the

371
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:36,120
the owner brother supposed to be like a

372
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,000
greedy stupid guy but not a quick fix

373
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,170
they could have done they could have

374
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:41,970
showed him I kind of off-screen drinking

375
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:43,860
and drinking was like he's a drunk ya

376
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:48,000
know by you know during the scene I did

377
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,800
not he think about that job he would

378
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,630
have done this sober he would have rocky

379
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:53,220
they were drinking too much he's like oh

380
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,110
it's disappearing we'll work on it

381
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:56,430
laters and no let's do it

382
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:58,410
hey double whole thing in the water well

383
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:00,330
he trips and He pours it all over his

384
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:02,160
own arm and it flows in the water but he

385
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,330
was gonna dump it in the water anyway

386
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:06,360
and this triggers you know the scout and

387
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,480
the scientist to scream no but for some

388
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,000
reason they start running

389
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,950
it's flashing into the water towards the

390
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,720
business they're not gonna stop them

391
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,330
he's too far away and one guy even like

392
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:18,860
you know Jake Gyllenhaal's character

393
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:22,210
like fucking dies in her poetry like

394
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:24,950
whatever but you see all these like

395
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,870
little conveniences and you're like what

396
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:27,320
is happening

397
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,880
no don't you what the fuck are y'all

398
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,040
doing you know a bunch of dumbasses and

399
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,590
yeah that could happen but I don't know

400
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:35,900
it just felt a little bit forced

401
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,330
so all four of these more fuckers are

402
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:41,240
like submerge well two of them were

403
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,520
submerged the you know obviously the

404
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,330
scientist and the the Scout are

405
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:48,380
submerged and they're fucked and they're

406
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,780
like near death and her skins melted

407
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,820
your skin's melting off so Jake Jake

408
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,550
kills himself and the other guy you know

409
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,680
they formed this bond in partnership and

410
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,480
he just wants to talk about his partner

411
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,610
and I'm sorry I died before you didn't

412
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:03,470
know who he was talking to is he's

413
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:05,360
talking to john c reilly is character

414
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,790
not Jake Gyllenhaal's character and then

415
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:10,610
he passes away and it's like damn man it

416
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:12,740
I don't know like kind of felt for

417
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,339
nothing

418
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:16,510
but it's not for nothing because of

419
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:19,760
their goodness and their ideals and

420
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,610
their slow down talked about things and

421
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:24,800
confront things and say things out loud

422
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,420
I think the sisters brothers grew and

423
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:32,060
you know john c reilly shares this story

424
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:34,370
about their father and and how his

425
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:35,840
younger brother how he protects his

426
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,640
younger brother younger brother ended up

427
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,320
killing the father and gets in a lot of

428
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,120
trouble and then even the younger

429
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,950
brother who is this you know rash you

430
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:44,570
know wants a fight and gunfighter

431
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:46,970
starts to work hard with them and and

432
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:49,310
starts to turn a new leaf so the point

433
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:51,470
of the meeting with the other group is

434
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:54,140
they change into better people and they

435
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,860
managed to find a way out of their

436
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:00,350
shitty sad assassin existence that will

437
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:03,920
end in death and thankfully it doesn't

438
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,350
end in death they after this experience

439
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:08,210
they you know they bear those i don't

440
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:10,730
even think they bear them

441
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:13,880
shit well they took the gold and they go

442
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,679
off and you know they go to their Mama's

443
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,890
house and they go their mom and then the

444
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:21,200
story ends with them happy living with

445
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,720
their mom oh well obviously you know the

446
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,490
guy loses an arm well and then it

447
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:27,049
doesn't end there because their boss had

448
00:18:27,049 --> 00:18:29,000
sent them out knows that some of them

449
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,230
are coming out and so like other

450
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:31,850
assassins are coming to kill them all

451
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:33,200
the time then you think that there's

452
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,299
gonna be this final scene yeah and then

453
00:18:35,299 --> 00:18:36,440
this is the problem I had with the

454
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,809
convenience it's one it was convenient

455
00:18:38,809 --> 00:18:40,400
for walking Phoenix's character you like

456
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,380
all of a sudden become an idiot and then

457
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,150
pour caustic solution over himself and

458
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:46,400
the sigh and they kill the other two

459
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,530
guys and then it's absolutely convenient

460
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:50,870
the day before that they're supposed to

461
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:53,240
kill the big bad guy they heart attack

462
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,100
and die oh that was the other thing so

463
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,770
yeah you know but they do these great

464
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,330
amazing scenes like you know his

465
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:00,679
brothers getting his arm sawed off

466
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:03,260
because you know it's useless and John

467
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,910
has to go out there alone and take on

468
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:07,790
some things really great little scenes

469
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,380
like that throughout the movie that's

470
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,390
worth going through some of the slower

471
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:13,030
parts to get to these parts because

472
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:15,980
those leave impressions on you and yeah

473
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:18,049
once they go to the Komondor cuz you

474
00:19:18,049 --> 00:19:20,090
know Joaquin Phoenix wants to take over

475
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:22,809
his role or that was maybe the intention

476
00:19:22,809 --> 00:19:25,520
he's already dead and he's in a funeral

477
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,760
which leads to a very funny scene of

478
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,720
they're the only ones that show up to

479
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,070
the funeral they're like can we close

480
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,600
the casket announcer and he's like oh

481
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,299
yeah sure I guess then he runs over just

482
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:39,980
he's just amazed like just to make sure

483
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:43,669
I'm just making sure but they were all

484
00:19:43,669 --> 00:19:45,500
prepared to like go in there in a gun

485
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,900
battle honestly I thought this film was

486
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:50,360
gonna end in the classic tragedy you

487
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,130
know what I mean where it's like well

488
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:53,600
they're assassins they've killed

489
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,580
innocents they've killed bad guys and

490
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,440
this is just a life because so many

491
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,040
Westerns end in that way and Sundance

492
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,320
was Sundance in something kid the

493
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,919
Sundance Kid I forget it's Butch Cassidy

494
00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:09,140
and the Sundance Kid it ends you know

495
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,820
and I was like oh they're going for

496
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:13,190
something like this and it it actually

497
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:14,270
has a happy ending

498
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:16,040
yeah I was surprised about the happy

499
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,150
ending because the entire movie they

500
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:19,340
were john c reilly was trying to get out

501
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,020
he's like don't you think about just

502
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,940
getting out and living in pieces I know

503
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,470
this is my life

504
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:26,630
fucking Jake Gyllenhaal's characters

505
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:30,920
like well you you don't have much like

506
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,740
long to live yeah I'm fucking done so

507
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,240
there was a lot of foreshadowing you're

508
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,980
like oh these guys are gonna die yeah

509
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:40,420
but no but no it was a happy ending so

510
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,800
what's your in mind because I've been

511
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,170
through so many of the the rough endings

512
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:46,490
that I was like alright you know what

513
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:48,620
sisters brothers they get to end their

514
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:51,670
life happy and it's just that kind of

515
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:54,470
unevenness that is throughout the film

516
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:57,530
and I don't know if it's a result of the

517
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:59,330
director trying to experiment and do

518
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:02,270
some things that maybe aren't normal in

519
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:05,990
the western genre but overall it's a

520
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:08,480
good watch so I'd still recommend it

521
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,770
what problems did you like I had a

522
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:12,740
couple well so what I was talking about

523
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,720
like the bad things happen to them yes

524
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,970
he gets bit by a brown recluse in his

525
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:19,130
mouth okay the very next day a bear

526
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:22,570
attacks them at a better time and like

527
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:24,920
here's the horse leaves this horse to

528
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,110
die and they are horrible and like it

529
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:29,180
mow his fill an opportune time like that

530
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,280
whole bear attack had no like shouldn't

531
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,750
have been in there like it was just it

532
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,100
was an unnecessary thing where it's like

533
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,140
hard get happened our shared remark

534
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:38,840
after hardship second wire and and then

535
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:43,130
you know they go to a little how podunk

536
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:44,720
town that's been controlled by a

537
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,660
Mayfield or something like that yeah and

538
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:50,390
is it make you yeah yeah yeah and this

539
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:53,240
is like some saloon owner that kind of

540
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,680
runs their own little town sort of like

541
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:58,670
a Commodore on on its own and and they

542
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:01,940
want to kill john c reilly and they're

543
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,260
they want to kill the sisters brothers

544
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:06,800
too and one of them is drunk as hell

545
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,540
five of them show up they somehow get

546
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:10,520
out of that but okay i'm by that i like

547
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,020
the fact that they're so good at gun

548
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:14,630
battles but it's just so many things

549
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:17,570
happen to them and then for it all to

550
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:20,660
culminate in everybody fucking up with

551
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:23,330
the solution and and then if one brother

552
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:25,010
having to have his arm cut off their two

553
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,630
friends that they met because they're

554
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:28,700
essentially they form a little bit of

555
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,310
and they're dead but at least they took

556
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:33,470
away something from the experience that

557
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:34,910
made them better people and I think

558
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:37,520
that's why it saved the film and I'm not

559
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,650
saying like oh fuck this you know this

560
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:40,940
is too far

561
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:44,320
you know they got saved in the end so

562
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,930
great performances good Western for

563
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:50,450
those that are ready for it okay this is

564
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:53,390
not a mainstream movie this is one that

565
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:56,900
fur for aficionados and people did

566
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,150
