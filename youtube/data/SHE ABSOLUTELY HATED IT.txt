after it

61
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:50,250
no excuses accepted for not running wow I know I said I'm not stopping four runs

62
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,529
anymore but look at this light

63
00:05:52,529 --> 00:05:55,559
look at that hashtag no filter

00:05:56,669 --> 00:06:04,289
the whole city is pink and orange doing Washington Bridge think I know I almost

65
00:06:04,289 --> 00:06:08,819

66
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:10,889
seen in New York City and I mean that

67
