1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:05,060
Poppy Harlow here. None of that sk*nk, Gloria Borger

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:06,960
GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:15,120
And you're watching Pew News.

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:21,840
Good evening. I'm Poppy Harlow, and you're watching Pew News, the most reputable news source in the planet

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,460
Remember Tana &quot;Mongo&quot;? Remember her?

6
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:28,240
H E  F * * K E D  M E  W I T H  A  T O O T H B R U S H

7
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,580
&quot;he f**ked me with a toothbrush!!!&quot;

8
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:36,800
No, you don't remember that?

9
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,600
Say n*gger

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:48,740
(flashbacks)

11
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:54,540
Well, she decided that she had so much fun at the convention that she was gonna create her own

12
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:58,320
called &quot;Tanacon.&quot; It was going to be the best!

13
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:05,560
It was you who put this together, and no disrespect to you but like you're the last person (Tana: No I...) who I'd think who'd arrange a conference.

14
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,020
Tana: I could not agree more!!! Like I was-

15
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,420
Cut to live footage of the event.

16
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:21,400
REFUND REFUND REFUND REFUND REFUND REFUND REFUND REFUND REFUND REFUND REFUND REFUND REFUND REFUND REFUND

17
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:29,680
&quot;I wasted 150 dollars on Tanacon. It's one hallway, one big concert room, and no activies.&quot;

18
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:36,360
&quot;No creators are walking around like promised, we stood outside for 4 hours just to be treated like animals.&quot;

19
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:41,500
Tana: Anything wrong or bad or whatever if there's bad security about it, it's me. It's on my fucking face

20
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,200
Dude: Yeah, your name is the conference

21
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,960
Tana: Literally, so I mean, I have been putting my heart and soul into making it as perfect as you can

22
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:51,460
And oh boy, it was perfect. (chuckles)

23
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:54,700
All the big celebrities were gonna be there as well!

24
00:01:54,700 --> 00:02:02,800
Tana: So I mean, right now, our lineup right now consists of so many insane creators, the ones that we have publicly confirmed right now are along the lines of - there's SO many, seriously

25
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,700
Tana: But um, me, Bella Thorne, she's doing it, she's amazing

26
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,500
UUAH, UUUAH!

27
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,900
BELLA THORNE?!

28
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,940
Never thought I'd hear that name again

29
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:18,620
That foul Nickelodeon kid, who wouldn't even say PewDiePie's name on the Teen Choice Awards!

30
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:22,100
Never forgive.

31
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:26,500
Felix something something sooomethiiiing.....

32
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,880
You know what, be here if you wanna hear the rest of your name

33
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,740
AAAAH!

34
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:35,940
I'm not even PewDiePie, and I am super offended. (laughs)

35
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:39,040
&quot;she is so mean i feel bad for felix&quot;

36
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,200
I know!! So mean!

37
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,140
What did I do? She's friends with Tana, you can't even say her name. &quot;Mon-go&quot;

38
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,480
Alright, who else is gonna be there?

39
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,760
Tana: And we have Shane Dawson, we have all of Shane's-

40
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,280
Shane! okay

41
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,040
&quot;I guess a convention just can't be thrown in a month...not realistic&quot;

42
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:01,580
&quot;I genuinely support Tana Mongeau for trying something like this but at this point i don't think it's safe&quot;

43
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,100
Who else made an appearance?

44
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,120
Tana: Ricky Dillon! An OG crea-

45
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,240
Ricky Dillon, who tweeted out &quot;Ok sorry jokes aside what's going on with tanacon?&quot;

46
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:15,700
&quot;I have panel at 3, is it still happening?&quot; (laughs)

47
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:20,700
UHH, so, apparently, they booked a lot of people from Vidcon to come to Tanacon

48
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:26,660
which are both happening at the same time, I think they're both in Anaheim, I'm not sure, I don't care enough to find out

49
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:34,240
Uhh, but apparently they- they- they booked people that were supposed to go on the same panel at the same time over at Vidcon and Tanacon

50
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:39,820
But even if they wanted to come, it was basically impossible because it was just too much of a mess

51
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:43,380
There were supposed to be all kinds of food at Tanacon,

52
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:47,360
&quot;What kind of food would you want to eat with her?&quot;
Tana: Oh my god, that's hard!

53
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,320
Tana: Everything! I love the way she eats like fried chicken- (laughs)

54
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:56,360
People tweeting out: &quot;There's no food. There's no water.&quot; (laughs)

55
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,660
&quot;We been standing in line for 4 hours.&quot;

56
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,640
But you know what there was?

57
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,180
Who needs food, and water,

58
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,980
Especially when It's hot outside, you're standing in line with no cover,

59
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,720
You know what you can get instead?

60
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,700
Condoms.

61
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,660
That's right.

62
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:14,520
Not just any condoms! I know, It doesn't sound that great,

63
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,660
But listen to this:

64
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,280
It's TANACON

65
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,100
-doms.

66
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,980
(shakes head)

67
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:26,420
My only regret in life, from birth to now, is that I wasn't able to attend TanaCon.

68
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:30,120
Where you can pay $70 to get a condom.

69
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,260
Tana: I like to think of it as something younger

70
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,840
This is a convention for something younger

71
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,540
Here's some condoms everybody.

72
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,380
&quot;TanaCon! Yeah, 'con' is a good word for it.&quot;

73
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:44,620
&quot;First, you put it at a venue that can only hold A THOUSAND people max,&quot;

74
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:49,620
&quot;Then you tell your fans that the gift bag is gonna be worth quadruple the ticket price,&quot;

75
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:54,800
&quot;But your gift bag is only a smartphone grip, a wristband, and a CONDOM.&quot;

76
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,340
&quot;The only thing I need protection from (snap) is yo lies&quot;

77
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,380
(laughs)

78
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:04,020
Another thing about TanaCon was that the tickets were going to be free

79
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:07,100
you know, finally a convention that *everyone* can enjoy

80
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,780
Very noble cause

81
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,540
Tana: You know, perks and stuff like that
Dude: You have different levels, right?

82
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,540
Tana: Yeah, exactly, exactly, we have free-
Dude: General Admission

83
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,540
Dude: VIP
Tana: We have Featured Creator and Featured F**KING Creator

84
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,220
Dude: Is that what It's called? Featured F**KING Creator?
Tana: Yes, literally, see-

85
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:21,500
Tana: Featured Creator is the free ticket because everyone's a Featured Creator at TanaCon

86
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,000
Tana: And Featured F**KING Creator is- yeah
Dude: That's nice

87
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,060
Tana: Yeah, ah- 100%
Dude: Everybody's a Featured Creator?

88
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:29,180
Tana: Exactly, I want that inclu- inclusivity, would that be the word?
Dude: Yeah yeah yeah

89
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,380
Tana: Feeling, you know?

90
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:35,340
The problem is, when you make something free, a lot of kids will be there (laughs)

91
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:39,300
Maybe too many kids than what Tana had initially estimated

92
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,140
&quot;This is the Meet-n-Greet check in line&quot;

93
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:44,860
&quot;This is crazy... what-&quot;

94
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:49,460
&quot;So you end up right here, but you start way back here&quot;

95
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:52,980
&quot;I... am loss for words... TanaCon, this one crazy&quot;

96
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:55,060
Jesus Christ

97
00:05:55,060 --> 00:06:01,680
So the event was too small to hold enough people, people were left queuing outside for 4 hours to get in

98
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:08,660
despite even have to pay for tickets cause you could pay for the more &quot;exclusive tickets&quot; but you still had to stand in the same line

99
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,720
as everyone else that just came for free.

100
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,820
Which then led to the event inevitably shutting down.

101
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:17,160
Girl: Are you apart of the event? (Yes) Do you know what's going on? (It's been cancelled)

102
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,340
The whole events been cancelled? (For today.) Okay. (Tomorrow It's back up and running,)

103
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,460
(2 different venues for more space.)

104
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,760
Okay, what's the other venue gonna be?

105
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:28,140
(It's gonna be announced tonight, probably on Twitter) Okay, through Tana's twitter? (Most likely, yeah) Okay.

106
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:33,120
(people talking)

107
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,420
(people talking)

108
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,960
I'm just waiting for the elevator to clear out

109
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:43,200
(people talking)

110
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:50,940
(people talking)

111
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:51,840
Guy: Fuck that!

112
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,460
Girl: No refunds!

113
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,380
People yelling &quot;refund&quot;

114
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,360
&quot;Give us refund&quot;

115
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:00,380
REFUND REFUND REFUND REFUND RE-

116
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:06,540
This reminds me of that Instagram Model Island Convention or whatever

117
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:12,680
where you'd pay a- a large amount of money to meet celebrities, you're sold this idea and then

118
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,320
it just got out of hand or it's too poorly managed.

119
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:20,900
This is certainly not the first time a convention has gone to HECK

120
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:27,040
Tumblr had their own convention, the notorious Tumblr convention that HAD A BALL PIT!

121
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,480
A ball pit!! What?!?! (laughs)

122
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,620
Guy: There's a ball pit!?! A ball pit! What? Yep-

123
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:38,420
Safe to say, it was a disaster. Now, apparently, they're gonna do another two extra days

124
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:43,280
uh to... make up for it. I don't know how that's gonna make anything better at this point,

125
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,980
because you've already get the TanaCondom!

126
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,060
What else could you possibly want?

127
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:53,280
If I got a TanaCondom, I would just leave, because I- that's all I want.

128
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,860
These greedy kids just want more and more and M O R E!

129
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:02,160
Now, you may be wondering, &quot;Why did Tana do a convention? Why didn't she just not go to VidCon?&quot;

130
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,240
Well apparently, she had a long beef going on with VidCon.

131
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,420
She wasn't given a &quot;Featured Creator&quot; pass which is given to the people

132
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:15,180
on VidCon, the creators, to, uh, get special access uh-

133
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:18,320
around the convention. They can enter back stage,

134
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,440
they get their own, uh, meet-and-greet sorta stuff...

135
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:26,580
And to be fair, I don't know, probably who, 80% of these people are.

136
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:31,440
I fee- if you ever wanna feel disconnected from YouTube, just check who's going to VidCon.

137
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,160
And you can just be like &quot;What?! These are the featured creators?&quot;

138
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,800
&quot;I don't know who they are.&quot; I mean, obviously some I know.

139
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:44,520
It feels like the YouTube Rewind videos. It's not what YouTube is. It's what they want it to be.

140
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:53,680
And VidCon, you know, they pick who they wanna have as a featured creator, because they don't want probably more controversial creators like Tana &quot;Mongo&quot; to attend their event.

141
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,900
Which then leads to her coming to the event and then fans swarming around her.

142
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:04,280
which leads to safety issues and she gets kicked out, and apparently this happened year after year.

143
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,800
She got fed up, &quot;Why can't I just get a Featured Creator pass?&quot;

144
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,640
&quot;Cause I wanna meet my fans&quot;

145
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:13,720
So, eventually she just got fed up and she said &quot;okay, I'm just gonna make my own TanaCon.&quot; So

146
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:18,520
the whole idea behind it, I'm totally all behind. I don't like VidCon.

147
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:23,160
I think it's nightmare. I think it's literally Hell on Earth, and I wouldn't wanna go there.

148
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,340
And especially the fact that they don't pay anyone to go there.

149
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:30,420
The whole premise of VidCon is that you get to meet YouTubers.

150
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:34,020
That's why people are paying $200 for tickets.

151
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:38,580
None of that goes to the actual thing that drives for the sales of the tickets.

152
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:45,840
And It's kinda like- it's this weird guilt thing where &quot;Oh, you're not going to VidCon? Well then you don't care about meeting your fans.&quot;

153
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:50,700
When clearly, YouTubers are just being used by these com- companies.

154
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:56,480
But then again, VidCon does offer you a venue for you to meet your fans in a safe environment.

155
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,940
Or at least that's how they say it is (laughs)

156
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:05,520
Tana: But there's yet to be an influencer really doing like a big American, like, in California like convention with-

157
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,289
Dude: But why not?
Tana: all these big YouTubers

158
00:10:06,289 --> 00:10:07,420
How come no one's done it?

159
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,100
Tana: I don't know and I don't know why it's-

160
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,180
Lemme explain why: because it's really hard

161
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,980
to pull off a convention.

162
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:18,200
I think every single convention - their first one, has been a disaster,

163
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,600
because you need that experience, you need to build it successively

164
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,700
(Is that what it's called?)

165
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,960
S U C C E S S I V E L Y

166
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,660
Every single year,

167
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:31,060
make it bigger and bigger and bigger, you can't just immediately jump to 15,000 people.

168
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,500
You gotta start very, very, very small.

169
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,620
And if you sell tickets on the premise that it's gonna be free,

170
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:40,940
obviously if people didn't even get the tickets, they're gonna show up anyway.

171
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,580
Which is what happened, and it got outta control.

172
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:47,860
So, I hope she takes whatever she learned, even though I meme'd this whole thing,

173
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,540
uh, and she does it next year!

174
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,720
And maybe name it something less r*tarded.

175
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,260
So long VidCon, it's been real.

176
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:56,100
(crowd yelling)

177
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,980
This is the reason why I don't wanna go to VidCon.

178
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,600
People screaming at you is just obnoxious.

179
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,240
So long VidCon (slow-mo)

180
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,900
There's no reason-

181
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:05,920
no reason-

182
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,760
why anyone should treat me more than anyone else.

183
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,100
I don't want it. I find it annoying.

184
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:16,500
If I can't talk to another person without them getting past the barrier that somehow I'm a big YouTuber,

185
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,740
then I don't wanna talk to that person.

186
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:23,020
It's just a waste of time. I hate promoting this whole idea that you have to act all-

187
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:28,980
cause this is taught behavior. This is not in our DNA that we should somehow react this way

188
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,040
for people that we think is &quot;celebrities.&quot;

189
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,840
It's just so idiotic.

190
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,100
I hate this whole concept of

191
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,960
&quot;fame&quot; and &quot;worship.&quot; Why?

192
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,820
Why is that a thing?

193
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:45,240
Same reason I don't like getting recognized a lot of times anymore, because people just start screaming.

194
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,840
And they make a big scene.

195
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,220
And I'm just there like...

196
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,040
&quot;Why are you yelling? Just stop.

197
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,900
I just- now I don't wanna be here.&quot; (laughs)

198
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,820
If people meet up and just talk like a normal person,

199
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:59,160
it's so much more pleasant, and it's just fun, and it's just cool.

200
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:06,180
And, I hate how this whole idea of worship is being promoted through this VidCon event where people just run around like f*cking Neanderthals

201
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:12,140
and yelling &quot;AHHHH!&quot; because they saw someone famous and they hope to see someone famous on YouTube. It's just so stupid.

202
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,520
I hate it. F*ck all your conventions.

203
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:18,920
That was a lot of time on one topic, Felix. Yes it- I mean Poppy.

204
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,100
Yes it was.

205
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,520
Moving on, however, to the next story.

206
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:31,180
The World Health Organization included &quot;Gaming Disorder&quot; as the latest version in its Disease Classification Manual.

207
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:34,760
We've talked about this before, but now it's finally been made official.

208
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:41,820
World Heath Organization, W.H.O, has announced &quot;gaming disorder&quot; is a thing. It's a real thing.

209
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:46,760
Now I'm kind of on the fence on this. I don't really know where I stand to be honest.

210
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,860
I really do see both sides.

211
00:12:48,860 --> 00:13:00,560
A lot of people are questioning this move, scientists specifically, saying &quot;there was lack of good quality scientific evidence about how to properly diagnose video game addiction.&quot;

212
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,780
Also arguing the point that &quot;we're essentially pathologizing a hobby.&quot;

213
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:10,960
&quot;What's next? Tanning addiction, dance addiction, exercise addiction...&quot;

214
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,360
But no one is having a conversation about them.

215
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:19,680
And I kind of- I really do understand this point. Why is gaming specifically being targeted here?

216
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:27,860
It seems like it's just a very popular topic right now. But, why is gaming getting- taking the whole beating?Essentially,

217
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:32,620
it's an addiction, yeah, but why is &quot;gaming disorder&quot; a thing?

218
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:40,940
I was heavily addicted, I have no doubt about that, I just- I denied it for many, many years. You know, saying that &quot;oh yeah, I really need it when I travel away, it's so important.&quot;

219
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:44,380
Whereas I wasn't sort of really confronting the issue itself.

220
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:47,680
(laughs) So... (laughs) what?

221
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,740
The World Champion winner of Snooker says he was addicted.

222
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,940
That's how he got World Champion...

223
00:13:53,940 --> 00:14:01,520
You could say that anyone that tries to get an Olympic medal- &quot;Oh you're just.. uh you're just addicted...to training.&quot; &quot;You're training every single day!&quot;

224
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,700
(laughs)

225
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,520
&quot;You don't even let them have games at all?&quot;

226
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:09,940
&quot;I have so far managed to resist-&quot;
&quot;How old are they?&quot; &quot;They are 6 and 8.&quot;

227
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:18,720
But I- I really do question the, uh, how sensible it is to invite something that we know is very addictive. Computer games are very addictive.

228
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:26,880
So with Fortnite getting so popular, especially with young kids, a lot of parents are discussing this right now as well. It's obviously a very

229
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,380
popular topic.

230
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:32,760
This women saying that she doesn't even let her kids play video games at all,

231
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,260
and she sorta says it proudly as well,

232
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:44,480
and, I'm not a parent, I don't know what that's, uh, what it's like to raise kids and make them follow your, uh, lead, but I think disallowing kids from doing something..

233
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,140
that probably everyone in their school is doing,

234
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:54,000
is a terrible idea, and I guarantee you these kids are sneaking out to just play with friends and such instead.

235
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:01,640
And I think, from personal experience, that if you're not allowed to play video games, you're going to over-compensate that at a certain point.

236
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,680
Hello everybody, PewDiePie here. (laughs)

237
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:09,620
I personally wasn't allowed to play video games as much as I wanted to, when I grew up.

238
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:16,640
I think if anything it just took me longer to realize myself that I don't want video games to be the main focus in my life,

239
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:23,060
because I wasn't allowed to play as much as I wanted, it sorta made it like, it turned into all the focus, even when I wasn't playing.

240
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,180
So it didn't really make any difference.

241
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:28,860
But then again, you have people on the complete other end of the spectrum where

242
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,440
people are dying from gaming binges.

243
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:37,400
Girls as young as 9 has to go to rehab, because they wet themself to keep playing.

244
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:41,900
Obviously you can be addicted to anything, and people do get addicted to gaming.

245
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:48,440
Classifying it as a disorder, however, specifically gaming disorder, I don't know if that's necessarily helpful.

246
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:56,220
I think the most effective thing would to be to teach kids &quot;Okay, work first, play later.&quot; At least that's what I'd do if I had kids.

247
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:06,120
I know I asked this question last episode, but, I think teaching kids that attitude at a young age &quot;okay fine, you can play video games, you can do whatever you want as long as you do your work first,&quot; right?

248
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,240
Makes sense, right?

249
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:11,620
I don't know, I'm talking like it's- as if I know everything about parenting. Clearly I don't.

250
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:14,760
What do you think? Leave a comment down below and let me know.

251
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:18,700
(popping noise) That was oddly sexual. (pop)

252
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:22,620
The final news- (laughs) is just a random meme.

253
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:26,880
All he needs to tag is #BlackOps4

254
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,480
and #CallOfDutyPartner

255
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,880
and the rest can be his words

256
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:37,140
Call Of Duty, why don't you pay me? I promise you, I can do better than this. (laughs)

257
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:42,980
Whenever I have to do a sponsored tweet, the client always sends like &quot;okay, can you do this sorta wording?&quot;

258
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,980
and I always change it up completely,

259
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:50,380
because I don't want it to sound like I'm a robot or I am- I am a lawyer or someone completely different.

260
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:53,620
But, Deandre Ayton, he really took it to the next level.

261
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:56,780
(laughs) This is not the first time this has happened.

262
00:16:56,780 --> 00:17:07,580
We have, uh, 'Desean, can you please tweet this for the ESPYs party for tonight: &quot;Chillin' at the @ESPYS #NokiaPreParty. It's awesome.&quot;'

263
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:14,580
Or this dude on Instagram 'Excited to head to (city) and join the (team name).' (laughs)

264
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:17,520
Deandre deleted it and tried again.

265
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:26,140
&quot;Awesome time yesterday with the #BlackOps4 crew. Thanks for having me #CallOfDutyPartner&quot;

266
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:29,040
Meanwhile, I'm promoting **** games, everybody.

267
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,200
Thank you, that was it for Pew News!

268
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,440
(PEW PEW PEW PEW PEW PEW PEW PEW PEW )

269
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,500
Hope you guys enjoyed watching, if you did leave a like, I'd really appreciate it.

270
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:39,220
These episodes uh- do get, uh- f*cked

271
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:45,940
by the YouTube ad system so please, any support that you can give, I highly appreciate. Namaste.

272
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:49,180
This has been Poppy Harlow. Poppy out. (pop)

273
00:17:49,180 --> 00:18:06,000
(outro music)
