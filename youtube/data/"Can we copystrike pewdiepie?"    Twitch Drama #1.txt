1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:04,980
I really must contribute my poo poo in the loo, so may you all excuse me for one moment.

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,040
And you're watching Pew News!

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:17,280
**Pew News music intro**

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:21,400
Apparently, I have been pissing people off left and right lately

5
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,720
Oh

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,300
What did you do- what did I do?

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,260
A few days ago, I did a video where I tested out an eye tracker.

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,380
Basically, you could see where I'm looking at on this screen

9
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,620
So I asked people to send me videos of what I should look at

10
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,460
And of course people send me Twitch boobie streamers

11
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:41,940
And I very jokingly just said it out randomly in the video &quot;Stupid twitch thots!&quot;

12
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,460
&quot;Stupid...twitch thots.&quot;

13
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,040
It's a pretty hardcore stuff.

14
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:50,530
I definitely understand why people can see that in a very, very negative way

15
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:54,180
Well, as it turns out, a streamer name Alinity

16
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:58,380
had a few things to say or do about it, rather

17
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,100
Pewdiepie: This is so annoying

18
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:04,840
Stupid...twitch thots.

19
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,580
I just feel like they- they win over me, okay

20
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:09,440
and they're not gonna win over me

21
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,260
Stupid twitch thots. No.

22
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:16,260
Alinity: Se- seriously? You said that?

23
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,200
I'm gonna copy strike this guy

24
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,360
Just for that word

25
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,680
Gonna copy strike him

26
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,880
Yo!

27
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,880
Can we copy strike Pewdiepie's latest video?

28
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,420
Like, right now?

29
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:33,460
He called us Twitch thots

30
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:37,540
Pewdiepie: Now, I did see this very soon after it- it happened on the stream

31
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:41,120
Uh, my intention is never to upset people with videos.

32
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,320
I, uh, I just thought it was easier to just cut her out

33
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,040
But before we were able to do that,

34
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,640
The video did in fact, yes, get copy STRIKED

35
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,520
Swing and a miss he struck it out

36
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,120
To me, uh, thot is such a memeable word

37
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,560
that it doesn't necessarily have any negative connotation with it

38
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,940
I definitely didn't mean it in a negative way

39
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,760
It's just a joking word,

40
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,899
but I do want to apologize to Alinity and be clear

41
00:02:04,899 --> 00:02:07,540
It was never meant to hurt or upset anyone.

42
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,959
Alinity had a big problem with me using this word

43
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:12,030
Just like everyone else that watched it.

44
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,880
We're devastated

45
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,020
Streamer: Yeah, honestly the fact that I was in his video

46
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,200
(*Get ready*)

47
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,800
is crazy!

48
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,040
Now, we weren't sure if it was, uh,

49
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,880
Alinity that actually did the COPY STRIKE

50
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,740
Swing and a miss he struck it out

51
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,500
Or if it was just some random claim

52
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,340
'Cause I get those all the time anyway

53
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,100
But the day after,

54
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,060
she made a follow-up to this,

55
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,960
where she sort of boasted about

56
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,580
&quot;Yeah, it was me guys&quot;

57
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,440
Now, again

58
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,540
I can't show the clip but- and I don't recommend anyone to watch it

59
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:48,480
Because it's probably the most unlikable clip I've seen of anyone ever

60
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,260
She sits with a bowl of spaghetti,

61
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,460
smacking away going

62
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,960
*eating noise*

63
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,960
&quot;Yeah, I wasn't not heading out&quot;

64
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,860
And then, you couldn't get more stereotypical than this.

65
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,640
This is legitimately the transcription

66
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:17,280
*Reading text*

67
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:17,940
(*Good money*)

68
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,480
Good- good money copy striking people

69
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,300
Alinity, the most likable genius of all time

70
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:24,860
Ehhh

71
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:27,000
Of course, admits publicly

72
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,340
to, uh, abusing copyright law and basically,

73
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:33,200
it's an illegal act that could hold up in a court of law

74
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,900
My videos are 100% protected by fair use

75
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,120
They have- they stand on their own feet.

76
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,160
They had my own commentary

77
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,079
They work a lot of times as reviews often

78
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:47,720
It's me reacting to content, but it's me adding my own commentary giving criticism reacting to it

79
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:51,260
It's transformative work that would hold up in court law or at the very least

80
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:57,600
We've seen it. Hold up in a court of law is similar to H3H3 who had the lawsuit with another

81
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:05,110
Youtuber that didn't like what they said so they took it to court by copy copy striking

82
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:11,440
Which is very similar to what happened here to him to a much less full extent where

83
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:18,360
She didn't like what I said. So she wanted to take down my video or at least claim the good money for it now

84
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:22,530
I'm used to dealing with this sort of stuff. There's opportunistic people all the time

85
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:28,590
I've lost revenue out of videos because of the background track that was a parody of someone else's track long

86
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:30,510
So a lot of things happens all the time

87
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:38,820
I've had literally two two second screen clip getting claiming all the revenue of the video without saying what caused it and

88
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:46,340
This just shows to me how how easy it is to abuse YouTube fair use law justice and to see someone boast about it

89
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:49,320
so publicly and arrogantly uhh

90
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:56,880
It's so gross. So basically collab DRM the company that strike my video. They need license videos for a limiting

91
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:03,070
So at lenity has approved of them to do this essentially and that's why they took the revenue off of my video

92
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:08,460
Imagine if if I did something really bad and everyone reacted to it I could then

93
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:12,100
strike back by claiming all the revenue from this video and essentially

94
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:18,300
Censoring all those videos if I don't like what someone says about me I can claim that video and that's such a toxic

95
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:23,800
environment that it would just ruin YouTube. So to see people abuse it this so lightly

96
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,710
It's very dangerous and very harmful

97
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:28,920
I and I'm glad this whole thing is brought to light

98
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:33,700
Even though I do feel bad for Alinity because she clearly doesn't know how to handle this situation

99
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:39,760
Now this whole thing blew up on reddit it got a lot of upvotes. A lot of people probably pressured her

100
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:45,720
So she issued a statement now, I didn't think she could become more unlikable, but turns out I was wrong

101
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,840
I wasn't even gonna bring up this whole thing until I read this statement. This is so dumb

102
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:58,560
The reason I reacted the way I did is because frankly I am so frustrated and tired of the rampant sexism in online

103
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,290
communities. That definitely seemed like that was the case

104
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:09,520
I thought it was because of the good money. You were making from striking videos. Hmm. I take issue with someone like Felix

105
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,380
Degrading and minimizing women to what is largely a very young audience

106
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:18,900
Your audience is 12 year olds hoping to see some cleavage. Are you kidding me? *Shots Fired*

107
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,180
How delusional do you have to be to project this sort of statement?

108
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:28,240
That kind of nonsense spills over and ends up on my streamer where I end up being harassed for six hours

109
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,280
You brought this whole situation upon yourself and no one else.

110
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:37,720
She then proceeds to blame collab for the whole thing saying everything collab does is

111
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:43,980
without my knowing and I will state that I'm honestly upset that they claimed on videos that are clearly

112
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,380
transformative works

113
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,540
Can we copystrike Pewdiepie?

114
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,960
I am so upset at Collab for claiming this video

115
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,640
But can we copystrike Pewdiepie?

116
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:58,720
Did not want this to happen and I'm sorry it did. What did you want then?

117
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,189
She talks about this video called Alinity dancing compilation

118
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:08,300
Which is the collection of me playing the just dance game a game that I enjoy but the videos

119
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:14,520
Intended purpose has nothing to do with the game that I like and it's simply an objectifying video

120
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:19,980
How can they objectify me? I don't understand. I'm just playing a game

121
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:26,820
I'm just playing a game that I really enjoy explain. I just wanna play this Just Dance game.

122
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:30,620
Why do people objectify? I don't understand it

123
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,680
I don't understand why

124
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,199
She then deleted this statement

125
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:38,020
I assume it didn't get the reaction that she was hoping for

126
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:41,409
And then finally she went on PhillyD to talk about this whole ordeal

127
00:07:41,409 --> 00:07:46,949
That what I meant is like the only thing I know about the how that word is that they pay me

128
00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:49,500
So essentially because she felt powerless

129
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,000
White knight PhillyD over here

130
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,560
Congratulations, she was powerless. I just know that they pay me. That's all I care about

131
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,120
I don't understand how Collabdrm works, but can we copystrike Pewdiepie?

132
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,340
I don't understand how I'm getting paid

133
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:08,920
But can we copystrike Pewdiepie, by the way?

134
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:14,460
She didn't know she just didn't know cus she was being a bombarded by people to feel powerful

135
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,100
she said I can do that and at that point she explained a

136
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:23,960
Situation where Collab was really only supposed to claim videos where where there wasn't anything transformative as she trusts the company

137
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,660
She trusted the company

138
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,280
Poor woman

139
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,780
This is this is a story about abuse from a company taking advantage of Alinity

140
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:41,460
Can we copyright Pewdiepie? Ok, Collabdrm is a very big company. They must know the law. Everything must be fine

141
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,230
I trust it and I guess this is the way it works

142
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:49,600
That's why it seems like this incredibly unfortunate situation where she has this. How did this happen? It's so unfortunate

143
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:58,380
so because she doesn't want to feel like a victim she she puffs up her chest she acts like

144
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:03,020
Anything else is saying to me that despite her having a contract she is going to try to get out of it

145
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:09,880
So she no longer works with Collab. How noble she's basically saying that she'd never actually told the Collabdrm

146
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:16,780
to strike my channel and Collabdrm themself confirm that this is true that they just striked my video because

147
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,060
They work with Alinity

148
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,320
they didn't strike it because

149
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:27,660
Alinity told them and I find this information to be completely redundant because she she said I'm gonna claim the video the video got

150
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:34,410
Claimed and then finally she took credit for it getting the video claimed then because everyone fired back at her suddenly

151
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:40,720
The story is different suddenly its Collabs fault. Again. Finally Alinity I'm sorry for calling you a twitch thot

152
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,770
I will definitely be careful with what but using that word in the future

153
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:52,720
But you need to stop blaming other people. Stop blaming Collabdrm stop paying some sort of sexism narrative

154
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,440
stop blaming me and

155
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,800
Admit that you what you did was wrong. It's really not that hard

156
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,080
I know what it's like to be under fire by the internet. I've never had to use any of these excuses

157
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,160
Have you heard of the Barbra Streisand effect?

158
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,730
There's a woman try to sue a photographer for taking a picture over her house

159
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:11,189
The photographer didn't know that it was her house

160
00:10:11,189 --> 00:10:17,700
Just like I didn't know what the hell you were and by suing this photographer. You may see what I'm going here

161
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:22,880
Everyone find out this picture of the house, which was the opposite of what she wanted

162
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:29,340
Yes I was probably wrong for calling you a twitch thot but you brought this whole situation upon yourself and no one else

163
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:36,460
This brings me to the second and more important part of this whole thing. Honestly, I don't care about Alinity this whole thing

164
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:40,740
The hypocrisy around the whole situation. Is just laughable and fun for me to ridicule

165
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:46,160
For the more serious meat and bone of the video Collabdrm the company that did strike the channel

166
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:53,740
I'm I'm more than familiar with them and I understand their business and I understand what they're trying to do if they own

167
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:56,380
Licence for videos and they want to claim ownership for that

168
00:10:56,380 --> 00:11:02,860
I don't have a problem with that, but it seems to me more often than not they don't take fair use in in mind

169
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:06,700
Alinity reacted to my video just like I reacted to her

170
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:10,290
Why can you why can they claim all the revenue for my video for that?

171
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:17,040
For a 4 second clip they admitted afterwards that it was a human error, but it really wasn't this happens all the time

172
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,440
I've had like I said

173
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:24,560
I had two second audio scream get claiming all the revenue of the video which has nothing to do with the video

174
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,520
I've had seen just one image appearing for a few second

175
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:34,700
claiming all the revenue from the video the way fair use and the copy strike system works right now

176
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:41,360
is that if company claims your video you can appeal it but it's basically up to that company to then say yes or no

177
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,550
And of course, they're gonna abuse that power. Of course, they they hold too much power at this point

178
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:52,640
And I'm glad this whole thing was brought up. So hopefully these companies can be more responsible in the future

179
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:56,990
The final thing is like I said, I understand if you want to license your content

180
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:59,940
but if you truly care about protecting your content

181
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,740
You would at least say what it is your licensing

182
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:07,700
If you go to Collabdrm's website, they say receive the claim. My video is fair use

183
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,100
Why did you claim it? None of this is true

184
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:15,260
And if you go on can you give me the exact time of my infringement seems fair right?

185
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:21,840
If my video got claimed I at least get to know why it got claimed but no our job is to help creators

186
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:26,200
Control their content not to help infringers avoid claims. I'm a creator.

187
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,720
You're not helping anyone

188
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,250
You're just taking revenue

189
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:36,340
this is a perfect example of these patent companies that abuse patent laws to claim revenue instead of just

190
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:39,520
Protecting the product is the exact same thing happening

191
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:43,380
But with video content and since YouTube doesn't want to go in between of it

192
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:49,340
These companies abuse this power and this is one of the case which led to this whole ordeal Alinity knew

193
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:53,180
She had this power and that's why it became so transparent in this case

194
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:53,860
I think

195
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:59,580
YouTube should really ought to make it so that you have to say what part of the video got claimed or at least give an

196
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,160
option to

197
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:06,740
Mute that video if it's a just an image appearing on the screen just make the screen black at least give us that option

198
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:14,700
this video will 100% be monetized if there hits 50 thousand likes I'm Gloria Borger

199
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:19,280
And you're watching and you just been phill'd in

200
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:31,360
*Pew News music outro*

201
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:36,000
A.S.S IS AVAILABLE ON EVERYTHING
