That's right. *slaps the wall*

12
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,760
Can't let the indians beat us.

13
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,760

14
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,260

15
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,680
What the heck? It's going backwards

*LWIAY intro*

18
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:47,320
Hello, everybody. Welcome back to another week of LWIAY.

19
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,180
LWIAYahHHh

20
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,780
&quot;But Felix, what does LWIAY stand for?&quot;

21
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:51,860
It stands for shutufhuckuUu

22
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:54,780
No, I'm just kidding, it stands for: &quot;Last Week I Asked You&quot;.

23
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,520
It's an original concept, that I came up with myself. [ORIGINAL CONTENT ALERT]

24
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,140
Baslically, I asked you guys to do something

25
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:01,600
and the next week I review it.

26
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,600
And the memes just took over the whole reddit

27
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,620
Cause that's what everyoneurugughh (what?) - just uploaded anyway.

28
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:07,600
But I thought eaeahehehhhhh

29
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,040
Let's make &quot;LWAIY&quot; LWAIY again.

30
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:10,560
OK? (okay)

31
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,320
So I have a new challenge for you guys:

32
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,620
[high pitched voice] YAIY new challenge!!11! :D

33
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:16,460
[normal...er... pewds voice again] Yeah, I can see you, I can see you.

34
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:21,560
So last week I asked you guys to design my &quot;aim-controller.com custom controller&quot;

35
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,000
which will be the official Pewdiepie controller.

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,380
This is just not any custom controller, alright? ƪ(˘⌣˘)┐

37
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,380
You got: LIFETIME WARRANTY!

38
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,780
So when you have those epic rage gamer moments, wE GOT YOU cOVERED!

39
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:35,900
Actually, I don't know if it covers that at all I just felt like that would be a nice thi-*laughs pitifully*

40
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,900
It got smart triggers, alright? (wow)

41
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,840
You'll to be the fastest one (i'm shook :O)

42
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,280
There's a shortened pressure point in these babies, so you'll have faster reaction time then...

43
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,760
your enemies. You'll be the most epic
gamer of all time basically with this controller.

44
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:53,160
*pewds showing the controller* &quot;Ergonomic Back Paddles&quot; that's right, so you can hold this babie

45
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,320
FOR HOURS

46
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,160
without hurting your fingers.

47
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:01,340
It also has a mistakes: we should [inaudible] change the hike, the top, all that, good stuff and...different colors.

48
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:03,620
*claps* NOW LET'S LOOK AT THE WINNER

49
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:16,310
The official Pewdiepie controller goes to CreeperNinja! This one one by far...22.5k up buds. DAMN, a very nice ? *laughs*

50
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:21,320

guarantee, baby. I love it, it's so cool &lt;3

51
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:26,450
and you took the classic PewDiePie meme
and you made it almost better &gt;:D

52
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:30,980
Congratulations, CreeperNinja. I want to
give you the very first copy of it signed

53
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:35,980

54
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,360
