1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:05,560
are you kidding me cheap a kid

2
00:00:06,069 --> 00:00:10,809
Oh what is that you break it did you move it i just moved it

3
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:38,030
I never do this but it's a noon o'clock on a tuesday and just finished my run I

4
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:41,449
think it's just the like leftover jet lag

5
00:00:41,449 --> 00:00:44,900
I like one in the morning i'm so full of energy I'm a-okay

6
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,899
the trouble with an abundance of jetlag fueled energy at one of the more it

7
00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:53,899
means like seven eight in the morning just like a slaw

8
00:00:55,879 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm just I'm just getting a super super late start to no big deal with a late

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
start

10
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,030
you remember when read before i left my trip Carly and I were making like this

11
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:13,480
video in the blog was sort of like the behind what she looks like without heels

12
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:18,040
on and that's what i look like their foot off the app just kidding i'm

13
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:23,410
standing on a horrible so I just saw a rough cut of it and this is like a kc

14
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:26,979
blog videos this is like a real production video something for samsung

15
00:01:26,979 --> 00:01:30,729
and I thought you liked that was boring video ever since us explaining how to

16
00:01:30,729 --> 00:01:33,910
use the hardware samsung probably mad that they didn't say that

17
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:38,440
anyway I just saw a rough cut it's great i'm so excited about it

18
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:42,190
I'm seeing a lot of comments about people saying that I haven't done like a

19
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:46,240
regular episode in a while I was traveling and I made those videos about

20
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,330
what it was like to be on the airplane and then yesterday I made two videos but

21
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:52,420
what about New York City and one was about gear and I haven't done like a

22
00:01:52,420 --> 00:02:05,410
normal blog in a while so let me do that right now I'm missing my co-pilot the

23
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:10,119
hardest part of probably for me as being away from Candace I mean is the family i

24
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:14,200
miss work the city everything it's not just that she's my best friend here this

25
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,950
is kind of like my only friend what I don't have her around it just kind of

26
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:20,950
freaked out

27
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:25,090
you know that thing that many people say where it's like something something

28
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:28,090
something is how you find out who your real friends are

29
00:02:33,489 --> 00:02:40,209
let's don't make it meaningful and pretty natural

30
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:48,600
yes let's do that i don't know what i mean i see it i love radio personally

31
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,600

32
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:56,730
Francine's teacher or so works to get thrown out of school for being a bad kid

33

39
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:37,410
this is not fancy sneaker store this is the fancy shoe a story of Shula premium

40
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:44,640
like Italy when they see you again i add the egg white jean until you not with

41
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:51,990
your letter right now but you promised me coffee please

42
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,190

43
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:58,660
I just want to hang out with plans the coffee but then ran out of time looking

44
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,660
at

45
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:10,550
who you are or something for the baby

46
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:20,690
did you buy two guys of chips that kind of like it's trouble-dee I told you had

47
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:23,690
a meeting at four

48
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:45,340
that was a terrible date pick me up to it by morning i have not done mail time

49
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:50,169
in a while and i got like a whole bunch of packages from companies and I know

50
00:04:50,169 --> 00:04:53,710
they just want me to promote their product and then when i open it i feel

51
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:58,900
guilty like i have to promote their product but every once in a while

52
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:07,960
there's a company that I want to help promote alright my boosted board was

53
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,960
taken from at the airport in Australia

54
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:19,740
by the way chill out you guys attack the Sydney Airport on Twitter and the poor

55
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,759
like can you imagine the social media of the Sydney Airport us like field all

56
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:29,490
these angry tweets about $PERCENT by volume as hell I'm act this anymore in

57
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:33,330
any event in addition to losing boosted bored i lost the boosted word bag which

58
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:36,900
is a piece of shit and I'm glad that it's out of my life in the meantime this

59
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:41,039
guy named Mark he wrote me a letter it's not much of a company is really just

60
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,180
like him

61
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:47,159
this is like one guy is the opposite of a big company and he's trying to make

62
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:58,229
like the ultimate boosted board bag and I gave him all this feedback all right

63
00:05:58,229 --> 00:06:02,909
zippers feel strong now the feedback i gave you mark with do not dwell on the

64
00:06:02,909 --> 00:06:18,000
padding his super tough and the package deals appropriately pick a are you

65
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,110
driving already

66
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:25,500
ok I'll be down in four and a half minutes by one thing i love the bag is

67
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:30,240
no bigger than the board there's absolutely no need for extra space

68
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,439
inside of the board bag and I feel like you nailed that which makes for a much

69
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:37,169
much smaller back okay

70
00:06:37,169 --> 00:06:40,800
right off the bat cell phone maybe some critical feedback who are you kidding

71
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,629
with these zippers here the main zipper is the correct strength these zippers on

72
00:06:45,629 --> 00:06:46,830
the pockets

73
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:49,800
these are like little babies if purrs this is not the structural integrity

74
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:57,210
needed on a big bag these handles here seem robust also i like that this fabric

75
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:02,250
here is vertical vs at horizontal angle the horizontal angle put unnecessary

76
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:08,399
stress at the joint which makes it tear this is solid like this I like this a

77
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:15,120
lot mark alright the backpack straps are genius i look these d-rings here in this

78
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,120
plastic clip here the weakest link

79
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,330
cold weather is going to make this plastic brittle tossing around I'm gonna

80
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:23,849
lift the bag up like this one day

81
00:07:23,849 --> 00:07:28,499
and this whole thing in a snap off track trying to make initial impressions o

82
00:07:28,499 --> 00:07:33,119
sight on this I'm super psyched on this all right if you are boosted board owner

83
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:38,969
and each one of these bags go check out board bag and bored . . co I gotta go

84
00:07:38,969 --> 00:07:42,330
Candice outside waiting for me but if you want to know why I'm so willing to

85
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:46,979
promote something like this this is the email from the guy who sent it to me i'm

86
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:50,909
a one-person show right now if you have any feedback or suggestions let me know

87
00:07:50,909 --> 00:07:53,520

102
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:18,360
right when we do it's pretty princess into bed you know it's not the fancy

103
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:23,580
flight where all the fun travel my favorite thing in the world is this

104
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:36,060
being home in my office being with the family like ketchup her in it like a

105
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:41,250
brand of thought like is there XYZ sriracha sauce or just northeastern a

106
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:44,250
more obviously pasta

107
