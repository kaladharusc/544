15
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,060

here I'll talk to you about my new

17
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,720
friend has been a lot of videos lately I

18
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,010
want to talk about twitch you want to

19
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:30,150
talk about a lot of different stuff so

20
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:31,380
let's start off with this weight loss

21
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,790
update here because I know a lot of you

22
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,840
gonna be interested in that boom 350

23
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,690
pounds now as you guys remember in a

24
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:41,610
rambling video about last week I did say

25
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:43,559
was about 360 a lot of people pointed

26
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:46,140
out that I did weigh 373 pounds in the

27
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,600
mcjuggernuggets video I will remind you

28
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,180
you should not always believe everything

29
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,410
you see Namek Juggernog it's video

30
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,360
because we often do things like in the

31
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,760
psychosis areas like in mve like in the

32
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,320
devil inside that's not entirely

33
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,109
accurate but this is entirely inaccurate

34
00:01:00,109 --> 00:01:01,980
350 pounds that's what I currently weigh

35
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,960
in fact this was taken a few days ago so

36
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,159
I'm actually a little bit below it that

37
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:07,229
was the target goal have you guys

38
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:10,740
remember um I was stuck at about 360 for

39
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,330
a really long time I ended up breaking

40
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,820
my arm putting back on about 13 pounds

41
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,090
from just diet and exercise snafus and

42
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,340
idiocy and then finally lost that 13

43
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,900
pounds and then while Jesse was here

44
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,330
lost an additional 10 so pretty happy

45
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:25,890
about that pretty excited about it a lot

46
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,450
of people have wondered what has changed

47
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,130
and there's two major factors number one

48
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,990
I was not eating as healthy as I could

49
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,850
especially when I had a broken arm that

50
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,439
was my first and biggest mistake I was

51
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:36,750
probably eating 2,500 3,000 calories a

52
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:40,770
day honestly and then I was probably not

53
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,360
exercising at all I was in so much pain

54
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,590
I was barely able to get up and walk

55
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:44,790
around the house with a broken arm

56
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,009
Jesse while he was here showed me

57
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:48,360
something really fascinating really

58
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,880
interesting each day I was ready to push

59
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,380
myself a little bit further and do a

60
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,229
little bit more and exercise a little

61
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:57,439
bit more and try a little bit harder and

62
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,969
we did stuff like the cave exploration

63
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:02,759
and and and all the different filming's

64
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:04,259
and then you know all of setting up all

65
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:05,490
of the pranks and everything else that

66
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:10,129
we did what an incredibly incredibly in

67
00:02:10,129 --> 00:02:12,330
difficult time for me to do I was still

68
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:13,530
doing with Annie the

69
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:14,910
I was still dealing with the knee pain

70
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,410
that was still a big part of it but I

71
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:18,600
continue to push myself past the point

72
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,150
of comfort into the point of actual

73
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,850
exercise and I said to Jessie at some

74
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,830
point I said to him I have to remember

75
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,990
I'm no longer a 600-pound man I'm used

76
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:30,500
to thinking I can't I can't I can't

77
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,450
these days I don't know what I can and

78
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:36,450
what I can't do until I try you know I'm

79
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,489
half the size I used to be so

80
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:40,080
theoretically you think and only be able

81
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,580
to do twice as much but that's not the

82
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,709
case because twice two times zero is

83
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:44,940
nothing because I was able to do nothing

84
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,640
I I doing twice as much of nothing is

85
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,890
going to be nothing right but it turns

86
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:51,510
out that the first night we were

87
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:52,620
together and we were on Dickson Street

88
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,090
we were on Dickson Street for like a

89
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,400
couple of hours I was on my feet for a

90
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,310
couple of hours when we went to the cave

91
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,780
we were in the cave like two and a half

92
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,760
hours and then we still did the pranks

93
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,989
and everything else later that night

94
00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:07,470
there was so much to be done and I found

95
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,010
out that my body is able to do it it's

96
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:13,530
just a babe it's my doctor always talked

97
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:14,910
about non scale vector he's not scale

98
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,200
vectors and I know it's so stupid to

99
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,400
talk about that when I just shared a

100
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,920
scale of victory with you but the non

101
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,690
scale victories are so much more

102
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:23,430
important the ability to get up and to

103
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,140
move and to be able to exercise and to

104
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,549
be able to film and be able to do these

105
00:03:26,549 --> 00:03:28,320
pranks and do all this goofy stuff and

106
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,260
do all the fun stuff that we got to do

107
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:35,160
has been way better than seeing a stupid

108
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,709
number on a scale I'm still having

109
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:39,269
trouble with my lymphedema that is still

110
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:41,220
limiting as well as was the neck the

111
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,040
back and knee pain but I find as I just

112
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,480
do what my doctor tells me and I push

113
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,799
through things there to get better now

114
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,060
somebody got my supper at a dip point

115
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,370
out that you can't outrun bad eating

116
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,380
habits it is still so important that I

117
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:55,470
continue to focus on eating the way I

118
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,910
ate while Jesse was here

119
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:59,430
which meant lighter foods and and better

120
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:02,040
foods and less of them so once again I'm

121
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,660
back to tracking my calories and making

122
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,650
sure that I'm doing everything I'm

123
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:05,510
supposed to do

124
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:08,250
if you saw a tweet I made I said that I

125
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,109
was tired of being fat I was tired of

126
00:04:10,109 --> 00:04:11,670
being limited by my obesity I was tired

127
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:13,530
of making my own life harder when I

128
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:15,060
could do this work and I'm surrounded by

129
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:18,539
so many good people mcjuggernuggets kid

130
00:04:18,539 --> 00:04:21,269
behind a camera jeff Saxton's you know

131
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:23,820
swift UAV Jesse's cameraman all these

132
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,440
people who are on this exact same

133
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,670
journey

134
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:27,900
who are succeeding at their journey

135
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,850
Billy the fridge and watching their

136
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:32,100
success every day in my social media

137
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,450
feeds here on YouTube and elsewhere

138
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,550
especially interacting with him in real

139
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,110
life has really put me in a position

140
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,560
where I see no reason not to do the work

141
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,750
and continue to get there so about 50

142
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,340
pounds more to go before we can talk

143
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,720
about plastic surgery to remove a lot of

144
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,430
this excess skin and they are saying

145
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,230
with this excess skin we might lose

146
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:51,840
twenty maybe thirty pounds some people

147
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,180
lost as much as forty pounds by removing

148
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,740
this excess skin I think I might

149
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,300
probably be around twenty but it even

150
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,390
it's another twenty and I get to 280

151
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,680
that would be great but my original goal

152
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,660
is 300 pounds and I'm pretty sure I'll

153
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,480
hit it easily by next summer pretty

154
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,260
exciting stuff

155
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,670
now speaking of surrounding myself with

156
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,140
good people a lot of people have picked

157
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,510
up on them my friend Danny who I met

158
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:15,210
through the mcjuggernuggets video I was

159
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:16,800
looking for somebody to come play a

160
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,360
corpse from one of the pranks for one of

161
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,370
the videos I needed somebody who can do

162
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:22,470
special effects makeup I found her and

163
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:23,790
we've been hanging out off and on ever

164
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:26,520
since I know everybody wants to ship it

165
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,830
and I understand that and I respect that

166
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:31,080
but I remind you guys it's been a long

167
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,570
time so I'm really interested in dating

168
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:36,420
or anything like that I don't know it's

169
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,740
just nice to have a friend I haven't had

170
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:38,790
a female friend in a really long time

171
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:41,490
it's interesting so what's interesting

172
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:43,020
about that and though more importantly

173
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,400
is it's really getting me out of my

174
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,930
comfort zone doing stuff I would

175
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:48,000
normally not do we both love Halloween

176
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,830
so we're doing like haunted houses

177
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,540
there's one of the plans and zombie

178
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:54,390
walks and and decorations and stuff like

179
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:56,850
that I'd have been like in her social

180
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:57,720
media quite a bit if you want to give

181
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,850
her a follow I recommend it but that was

182
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,500
actually more my idea she's not somebody

183
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,270
who's ever really done a lot on social

184
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,470
media before but I think she's pretty

185
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:06,330
good at it and I love seeing her share

186
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:08,220
that stuff with the world so I hope you

187
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,570
guys give her a follow and check

188
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,670
everything out let's see what else did

189
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:12,930
we need to talk about this week let's

190
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,250
talk about the state of YouTube if

191
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,840
you've checked my YouTube stats for a

192
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,910
while I have been bleeding subscribers

193
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,670
lately like 100 200 300 subscribers a

194
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:21,770
day depending on the day

195
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:24,390
views are down it could be the algorithm

196
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:26,070
it could be my content it could be the

197
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:28,320
fact that I'm creating less and moving

198
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,150
more and doing more and less dedicated

199
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:32,160
to this job as I've ever been not to say

200
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,480
that I'm not dedicated to it I still

201
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,340
love it but now I'm really beginning to

202
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,930
focus on my health and are beginning to

203
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,640
focus on losing weight and I'm focusing

204
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,590
on exercising and focusing on

205
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:43,050
the world around me I feel like that's a

206
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:44,700
big part of it I know my contents not

207
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,490
the best on top of that but and you know

208
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,900
eventually my youtube bubble was gonna

209
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,550
burst now I'm getting told by folks at

210
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:52,620
YouTube a lot of it has to do the

211
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,290
algorithm a lot of fellow creators are

212
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,750
telling me the same thing at the end of

213
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,639
the day if the algorithm decides I'm

214
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:01,889
done I'm done if you guys decide I'm

215
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:03,090
done I'm done

216
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:06,000
that's fine I don't think that's the

217
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,010
case I think we saw a plenty life left

218
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,540
in this channel and plenty of great

219
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,460
videos to create and I'm really looking

220
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,810
forward to it especially as I get out

221
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:14,400
and to explore the world I want to show

222
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,419

223
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:16,260

224
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,970

225
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,860

across the weekend and of course my

246
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,010
panel if you didn't see the panel video

247
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:07,260
it's up that said I got to finally meet

248
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,120
james rolfe they agree video game nerd

249
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,340
and I was anxious and I could tell he

250
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,620
was anxious so I just kind of talked all

251
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,090
over him I didn't really get to hang out

252
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:16,020
with him and anything but it did get

253
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,880
that picture that I'd always wanted and

254
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,950
I did get to thank him for helping

255
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:22,080
inspire the Francis character helping

256
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,389
show that the Internet

257
00:08:24,389 --> 00:08:25,830
could be something awesome and that

258
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,600
gaming does belong on YouTube and help

259
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,550
encourage YouTube there was a time that

260
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,900
YouTube didn't believe gaming should be

261
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,419
on here but he helped encourage them

262
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:35,130
make it a place for gaming and I'm so

263
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:36,990
glad he did so got a chance to thank him

264
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:38,700
for that and what an incredible weekend

265
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,440
it was not just cuz I get to hang out

266
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,640
with friends not just cuz I get to see

267
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,349
fellow creators not just cuz I got to

268
00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:45,540
see james rolfe but almost more

269
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:46,860
importantly because so many of you guys

270
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,910
came out from all over the country

271
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,170
there's people from Seattle there's

272
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:51,270
somebody from Boston who flew in just to

273
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:53,640
see me even saw some of my usual twit

274
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,310
streamers

275
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:55,990
and I guess that's the one thing I want

276
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:58,120
to apologize for Ivan's street used to

277
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,100
stream on Twitch five nights a week and

278
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,540
I promise you guys in October I would

279
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,100
try to get back to a normal schedule I'm

280
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,240
trying to get back to it

281
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,790
but things continue to pop up I will be

282
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:08,319
out in the world then I realize it's

283
00:09:08,319 --> 00:09:10,240
almost 10:30 and it's just I'm gonna

284
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,399
miss stream that night and I'm so sorry

285
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,470
for that I so appreciate the support

286
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,629
that you guys give me on Twitch but i

287
00:09:16,629 --> 00:09:19,180
hope that you'll extend that support to

288
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:21,309
understand that right now i'm gonna

289
00:09:21,309 --> 00:09:24,009
point where I need this exercise to get

290
00:09:24,009 --> 00:09:26,290
this last weight off I need to be out of

291
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:27,699
the world and doing some really cool

292
00:09:27,699 --> 00:09:29,470
stuff and it's the only way I'm gonna

293
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:30,639
get the rest of this weight off and if

294
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:31,870
it means we have to miss stream every

295
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:34,089
once in a while I'm so sorry but your

296
00:09:34,089 --> 00:09:35,529
understanding is really gonna help me in

297
00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:36,999
the long run and I promise you when I'm

298
00:09:36,999 --> 00:09:39,579
a skinny boy and I'm as healthy as I can

299
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,100
be i'll stream 24 hours a day if you

300
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,509
want me to I promise you we'll get to

301
00:09:43,509 --> 00:09:45,040
that point I hope I have an audience

302
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,689

303
