1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:10,200
reading speaking of reading thanks for

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,759
the page number that lets me know it's a

3
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,200
totally real book about make-believe

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,400
things what is it that makes a man a man

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,330
narration by John Hurt is still

6
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:18,930
narration

7
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,970
combining science and black magic

8
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,980
because black magic alone isn't good

9
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,890
enough it all began in 1944 who he goes

10
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,119
through the trouble of having John Hurt

11
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:28,830
set the stage but omit it just enough

12
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,599
narration so we need text with a date

13
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:32,099
and location allowing it to hit three

14
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:33,750
expositional cliches in the first minute

15
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,890
well then slowly introduces a rosary so

16
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,480
we know some spiritual is about to go

17
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,040
down but they won't actually be useful

18
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,390
to anyway there's nothing on this island

19
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:43,680
with chiefin rocks

20
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,890
ruins not rock the remains of Toronto

21
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:49,620
may be built on an intersection of ley

22
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,329
lines room uses this opportunity to

23
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:52,469
explain why they're on the island

24
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:53,969
instead of earlier during the planning

25
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:55,829
phase of this mission also the Nazis are

26
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:57,090
conducting magical experiments on a

27
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,590
remote island you'd think they'd want to

28
00:00:58,590 --> 00:00:59,309
keep that a secret

29
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,840
it looks like they unfurled the banner

30
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,299
right away a freak in the gas mask car

31
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:07,830
Cronan this world war ii general is

32
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:09,510
unaware who hitler's top assassin is

33
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,760
he's yeah this is less than I thought

34
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,080
did anyone do any pre-planning before

35
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,640
this mission or they just winging it at

36
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,130
this point five years on a sachet god

37
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:18,630
how much expositional yelling can we

38
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:19,950
cram into this movie the Nazis

39
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,659
discovered pokey stop technology seventy

40
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:23,130
years earlier than everyone else I'll

41
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:24,540
open a portal

42
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,100
this guy explains what he's doing even

43
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,479
though I forget let's just give these

44
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:28,829
assholes five sins for beating us over

45
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:32,130
the head with so much exposition

46
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:34,290
this guy pulls pins on two grenades but

47
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:35,840
throws them one at a time

48
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,189
there goes Baron von will home from the

49
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:39,720
Nazi part of the family we don't talk

50
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,580
about him even though evil c-3po is

51
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,840
completely out of bullets and has no

52
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,400
cover no one shoots at him giving him

53
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,720
all the time he needs to show off his

54
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,250
blade nunchucks nameless henchmen

55
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,450
approach one of the time allowing them

56
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:49,979
to be easily vanquished cliche so the

57
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:51,479
portal pulls in a light fixture without

58
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:52,830
affecting it at all then the faceless

59
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:54,240
henchman gets sucked in and burns up on

60
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,740
impact but now this guy is getting

61
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,360
liquefied and pulled in a drop at a time

62
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,770
it's fine if you want to suck people in

63
00:01:58,770 --> 00:01:59,970
a deep space but at least do it with

64
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:01,740
some consistency the port has been open

65
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,289
for too long something may have come

66
00:02:04,289 --> 00:02:05,550
through even though all of us were

67
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:06,899
watching it and surrounding it while it

68
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:08,220
was open and would have seen something

69
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,350
come through or a Fe makes your ass

70
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:13,590
butan also that hugh jackman looking

71
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,970
motherfucker is supposed to be Rasputin

72
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:16,230
did they not have enough access to a

73
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,239
photo of the real Rasputin old-time Baby

74
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,440
Ruth product placement get me up

75
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,380
thinking this guy was ready to fucking

76
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:25,459
go with that blanket it's a boy it's

77
00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:28,170
just a baby boy these characters have

78
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,670
confused finding a demon creature in an

79
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:31,200
old abandoned church with the baby being

80
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,730
born I'm not sure how those two black

81
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:33,870
soldiers got into this platoon

82
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,160
considering the army didn't integrate

83
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,840
until several years after World War two

84
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,540
one full minute long title card Hellboy

85
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,310
comic book based on the rumors of a real

86
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,660
Hellboy based on the script of this

87
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,310
movie which was adapted from the Hellboy

88
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,900
comic book Moldavia doesn't exist

89
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,519
anymore the western half is part of

90
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:48,989
Romania and the eastern side is the

91
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:50,880
Republic of Moldova that said the former

92
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,620
principality of Moldavia had a pretty

93
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,090
bitchin flag it's a shame this guide

94
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,440
wasn't suspicious when they asked him

95
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,640
how quickly he bleeds

96
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,200
well you were there when the machine

97
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,730
popped his eyes out right no matter

98
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:04,079
really I'm just wondering how a thing

99
00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:05,610
that resurrects somebody somehow decides

100
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:07,349
nah you lost your eyes can't give those

101
00:03:07,349 --> 00:03:09,150
back room Brunton home grows up to be

102
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:12,480
Doc Brown lungs spine liver room has

103
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,129
cancer basically everywhere but is still

104
00:03:14,129 --> 00:03:15,420
able to stand and move around and

105
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:20,190
otherwise basically be fine even though

106
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,540
they explained who this guy is ten

107
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,950
seconds ago movie still felt the need to

108
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,180
put his name at the bottom of the screen

109
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,069
also why is a high ranking official for

110
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:27,750
the FBI on a talk-show discussing this

111
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,430
what's he going to do next dispute the

112
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,079
findings of the Weekly World News waste

113
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:32,670
management services

114
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:33,810
no one is suspicious of a waste

115
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,250
management services building that looks

116
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,200
this nice especially in New Jersey hello

117
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,079
I'm John Lee because of course he is

118
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:41,849
everyone's late but to what consequence

119
00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:43,590
nothing instead of walking all the way

120
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,879
to the counter like a normal person

121
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,440
John decides to stop right on the thing

122
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,090
that he doesn't know is an elevator turn

123
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:51,299
the pages please if you don't mind this

124
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:52,829
seems like an incredibly inefficient way

125
00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:54,269
to read waiting for someone to come

126
00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:55,829
along turn the page for you we find out

127
00:03:55,829 --> 00:03:57,299
later this guy can do basically fine

128
00:03:57,299 --> 00:03:59,069
outside water so if he wants to read a

129
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:01,049
book so bad you should just get out of

130
00:04:01,049 --> 00:04:02,669
the damn swimming pool and even if he

131
00:04:02,669 --> 00:04:03,780
wants to stay in the pool can they not

132
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,340
get an intern who laminate some pages

133
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,319
isn't this what I pay taxes for John

134
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:10,230
John T Myers Kansas City 76 Abe Sapien

137
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,639
expositional rambling April 14 1865 the

138
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:19,919
day that Abraham Lincoln died Abe

139
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:21,539
Lincoln died the morning of April 15th

140
00:04:21,539 --> 00:04:24,060
he was shot on the 14th Oh John gets

141
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,229
grossed out by something he's been

142
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:27,090
within no shadow for some time building

143
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:28,919

unsupervised this guy plays the pronoun

149
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:41,760
game six times even after he knows for a

150
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,199
fact that John has no idea who he's

151
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,639
talking about he never goes out

152
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,580
unsupervised home they're already deep

153

not tell this kid what he's here to do I

155
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:51,350
hate

comic book was he saying there this

157

guard giving him all the instructions

159
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,020
talked about him in the third person

160
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,730
like an asshole but he doesn't age like

he files them to fit in of all the

167
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,400
flimsy things going on is by far the

168
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,290
flimsiest he's a giant red Duke with the

169
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:16,700
tail that is basically a demon slash

170
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,050
government prisoner who the fuck is he

171
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,460
trying to fit in with the girl who

172
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,930
spontaneously combusts a better

173
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:22,460
explanation might be it's easier to put

174
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,720
on shirts without giant horns on your

175
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:30,890
head to cross the track oh sorry guys I

176
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:32,450
thought I stumbled into a screen movie

177
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:33,470
there for a second man

178
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,060

179
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:39,170
bearings here we're here at the go an

180
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:41,360
alarm was triggered slow news day one

181
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,030
sheet of glass between them enough story

182
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:45,950
of my life Abe says this like he's in a

183
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,510
terrarium most of the time but more

184
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,770
often than not he's out walking around

185
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,210
with everyone else by now for instance

186
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:53,690
just left us red take the hint

187
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:56,570
we don't take it's not digging its

188
00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:00,110
statue however was Hollow

189
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,690
I'm reliquary not quite a reliquary is a

190
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:04,250
container that a relic goes in hallow

191
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,170
statue is referred to in the archeology

192
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:08,090
community as a hollow statute perfect

193
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:11,150
job for these babies made of myself

194
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,680
where did you learn to make bullets

195
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,840
toontown Abe's telekinesis occasionally

196
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,220
needs to be aided by sticking his

197
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,710
suction cuppy hand to a door behind this

198
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:22,520
storm a dark entity EVOO ancient and

199
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,860
hungry and easily contained by common

200
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:28,850
doors hey stinky kitchens closed

201
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,620
Hellboy wastes a lot of time I'm using

202
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,300
himself with one-liners rather than just

203
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,620
killing the dark evil ancient hungry

204
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:36,080
entity entity's name is Samael the

205
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,520
desolate one son of snare gah brother

206
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,810
ape somehow can't translate the most

207
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,250
important work for Hellboy before he

208
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,330
does battle with this thing or just

209
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:46,070
decides to cut himself off for fun or

210
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,840
some fairly in this universe moderate

211
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,340
shoves that would simply knock a large

212
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,470
man back a bit send a very large demon

213
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:52,910
creature halfway across the room

214
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:54,200
since the holy water bullets didn't work

215
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,730
Hellboy decides a paintball might be

216
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,680
more effective hey crazy costumes huh

217
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,910
ice cover kid

218
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:02,830
hell fogger so now with people running

219
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,540
in the streets nobody wants to slow down

220
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,530
not one car

221
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:07,150
I see people slowing down for birds for

222
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:09,970
Christ's sake I'm fireproof you're not

223
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:12,460
and yet 42 seconds ago you singed your

224
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:15,010
finger on a hot horn I'm fireproof

225
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:17,500
you're not and this monster is death

226
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,420
proof did you forget that also is it the

227
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:21,160
protocol of a super secret FBI funded

228
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,110
program to just leave dead hellhounds on

229
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,270
train tracks see if touching your hot

230
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:27,340
horns hurt then why the actual does your

231
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:31,380
fingers being on fire not hurt at all

232
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,400
Dillon enjoys opera cliche

233
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,290
you know most movies use the lower third

234
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:37,210
location text to tell the audience where

235
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:39,220
the characters are not described the set

236
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,810
you bill unless there's a fictional city

237
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:42,430
called abandoned subway area

238
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,169
in the no longer existent country locker

239
00:07:44,169 --> 00:07:45,520
room now that this guy has glass

240
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,560
marbleize is the movie saying he can see

241
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,660
is the oh it's its tale don't worry

242
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,520
everyone it's just a stale also Bud

243
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,810
Light I'm still mad about Hellboy

244
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:54,130
killing that monster that can come back

245
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:55,690
to life and no one bothered to be

246
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:57,010
concerned whether or not it came back to

247
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,540
life or anything especially this guy I

248
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:01,930
need to touch it to see do you because

249
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:03,340
when we first saw you you were able to

250
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,600
tell us everything about John just by

251
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,190
looking at him and when you gave us all

252
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,510
that info about the monster you were

253
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:08,950
just touching the door of the room he

254
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:11,590
was in professor they were here boys

255
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:12,070
here

256
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:15,610
Nixon Houdini Jimmy Hoffa whoa Jeffrey

257
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:17,380
Tambor I got this but yeah he's right

258
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,760
enough with the pointlessly cryptic

259
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:22,990
pronoun game none of these guards are

260
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:24,280
shooting him either because they've

261
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,450
collectively been waiting for the

262
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:27,040
opportunity to live out that scene from

263
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,750
Raiders of the Lost Ark or they're all

264
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,400
questioning why as swords are so fucking

265
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,630
loud according to this flashback

266
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:33,460
Rasputin is the one who gives this hell

267
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,169
helm thing resurrection power so why did

268
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:37,060
a breed that it already had resurrection

269
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:40,410
powers for each one of you that falls

270
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:43,410
to show her eyes didn't Hellboy kill

271
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:44,550
that thing once and it just came back to

272
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,230
life by itself then he killed it again

273
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,940
and indeed we saw two after that but

274
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,440
shouldn't there be forward by now also

275
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,730
why do the bad guys go through all this

276
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,080
trouble let's create a monster

277
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,610
given resurrection powers and in the

278
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:55,500
unlikely event it gets killed BAM two

279
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,270
more baby I didn't they just take this

280
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,680
pile of angel tears go back to

281
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,000
headquarters resurrect this hellhound

282
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,470
kill it and let it spawn several times

283
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:03,240
to create an army also Abe sapiens

284
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,770
powers are officially way too convenient

285
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:06,420
at this point to be able to simply touch

286
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,590
a sword and have a full HD

287
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,510
professionally edited flashback of what

288
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:12,180
happened in the museum human fasiq it's

289
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,590
impossible to believe that Abe didn't

290
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:15,240
know this already and I'm super confused

291
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,800
about his powers does he have to touch

292
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,120
people or things directly to get

293
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,620
information or can he just sense it the

294
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,030
movie says both things are true he

295
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,290
couldn't figure out this guy was sick

296
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:24,630
until now you've lost a lot of blood he

297
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,600
has blood touched you five seconds laid

298
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,030
three eggs okay this movie is formally

299
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,350
trying to become the most confusing

300
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:32,910
thing ever made now you're telling me

301
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,590
this monster also lays multiple eggs

302
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:36,720
that also will become future hellhounds

303
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,280
it's already got the death creates two

304
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,630
more spell on it you're telling me it

305
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,990
reproduces normally too we can't risk it

306
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:44,220
tomorrow you go back to the tracks with

307
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,380
a group of agents tomorrow why tomorrow

308
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,210
doesn't this feel like something that

309
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:50,250
should be taken care of now fine those

310
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,230
eggs destroy them when Broome said to

311
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:54,210
John find those eggs John heard find

312
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:55,350
some backstory on Liz

313
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:57,570
Liz's clothes aren't burning off I see I

314
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:59,280
can help we're basically halfway through

315
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,600
the movie and you have done next to

316
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,320
nothing so far

317
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,870
what is your area of expertise he

318
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,430
doesn't want me with him he'll boy asks

319
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:06,720
a valid question that the movie doesn't

320
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,610
have an answer for so they smash cut to

321
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:10,230
the next scene using Hellboy's valid

322
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,670
question to make it seem like he doesn't

323
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:14,880
like John okay I'm not pure of heart yes

324
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,070
you are so John is Broome's worthy

325
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:18,630
successor not because he has immense

326
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:20,160
knowledge of the occult or any real

327
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,840
combat experience or is well-liked by

328
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,580
all the abnormal creatures in the BPRD

329
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,590
but because he's pure of heart you

330
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:28,440
moving mom I'm saying Dionysus which one

331
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,020
Pope st. Dionysus or st. Dionysus of

332
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,570
Alexandria st. Dionysus of Paris Saint

333
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:35,160
Dionysus the areopagus

334
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,380
Saint Dionysus of India is Sam's tongue

335
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,150
much shorter in water because we've seen

336
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,680
him use his tongue successfully over

337
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,540
much greater distances on dry land this

338
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,770
guy is definitely going to be killed

339
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:45,270
because his weapon has two charged fuel

340
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,690
and load

341
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:49,580
out of the resurrection didn't I kill

342
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,630
you already

343
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,100
Hellboy asks this even though he just

344
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,720
said how that creature was the Hound of

345
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,310
the Resurrection and they've talked

346
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:56,840
about how it comes back to life the last

347
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,520
time they ran into it trains and movies

348
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,960
always arrive right when a fight occurs

349
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,580
no one down here wants to run away from

350
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,500
the two monsters fighting really man

351
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,120
they can't miss that train no monster

352
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,620
fight has ever made them late and they

353
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,110
ain't starting now

354
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:10,760
phone ex machina also now that Hellboy

355
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,050
smashed this thing over the hellhound

356
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:13,520
how's Nico supposed to get back to the

357
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,900
Nebuchadnezzar why not just slide the

358
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,160
box of kittens over to the group of

359
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,180
people holding on to them while you

360
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,710
fight is definitely worse than just

361
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:19,700
leaving them where you found them I

362
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,960
guess no one explained to help only that

363
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,310
killing these things produces two more

364
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:24,140
not important information I guess after

365
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,970
stabbing clay approximately 15 times

366
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:27,770
Cronin's blade and glove miraculously

367
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,600
have no blood on them Hellboy decides to

368
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,710
attack his boss with a hot water heater

369
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,360
which is something I also learned you

370
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,460
shouldn't do the hard way something I

371
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,280
learned in therapy and depressed one

372
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:41,840
rubber band I'm impatient too so they

373
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,100
taught you when you have bad feelings to

374
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,210
inflict small amounts of pain on

375
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:45,560
yourself people who work closely with

376
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,910
elbow I haven't been told about his

377
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,650
escape yet and knowing his affection for

378
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:50,060
Liz seems like they might be the first

379
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,800
people to be called cream and sugar

380
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,630
moron she takes it black

381
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,160
two-and-a-half-hour movie wastes time

382
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,520
exploring Hellboy's unfounded jealousy

383
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,230
rap Hellboy clearly falls and misses the

384
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:01,700
ledge but somehow didn't fall to the

385
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:01,970
ground

386
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:03,410
shagging ice we've been dealing with a

387
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:04,760
lot of assholes who know how to come

388
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,170
back to life let's just leave their dead

389
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:07,340
bodies lying around and hope they don't

390
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,840
leave again also even though broom

391
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,700
removed the unexplained electronics that

392
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,350
kept Cronin alive he's able to wake up

393
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:13,760
for some reason and put himself back

394
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,160
together ah ah considering the distance

395
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,570
Hellboy through that and the speed it

396
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,040
was probably going this probably should

397
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,570
have killed John also we're still

398
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:21,950
watching John go on a date with Liz

399
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,540
while Hellboy is mad about it movie

400
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,890
proves that it's incredibly hard to look

401
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:26,150
menacing while walking down a spiral

402
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:27,800
staircase it's awfully nice of the New

403
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,030
Jersey Times to write a cover story

404
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,860
titled the apocalypse that would be

405
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,480
positioned just so to make sure we

406
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,070
understand what's going on hey guys we

407
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:35,600
decided to drive out to where we thought

408
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,190
you might be to give you the news of

409
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,660
brooms death rather than just calling it

410
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,280
rainy funeral and black umbrellas shot

411
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,110
from overhead cliche also every

412
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:43,460
motherfucker at this funeral brought the

413
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:45,230
same sized black umbrella to this thing

414
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,700
they knew this funeral would be extra

415
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,290
sad because the main character died and

416
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:49,700
there would be heavy rain since Hellboy

417
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,320
can't attend the funeral he stands on

418
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,490
top of the funeral home where he can

419
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:54,380
clearly be seen but no one sees him

420
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,450
except for Liz I'm not much of a problem

421
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:58,680
solver three decades

422
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,860
I've only completed two sides why not

423
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,629
use your magic front lobe that can see

424
00:13:03,629 --> 00:13:05,129
into the past and see what the Rubik's

425
00:13:05,129 --> 00:13:06,540
Cube factory worker did to mess it up

426
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,399
then work in Reverse John walks out of

427
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:09,809
the important mission meeting to watch

428
00:13:09,809 --> 00:13:11,519
Liz walk down the hall this coffin

429
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:16,529
survives this no no this is good this is

430
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:17,910
what the movie was missing a sassy

431
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:19,949
sidekick also this dead guy that Hellboy

432
00:13:19,949 --> 00:13:21,420
brought back to life told him there was

433
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,980
miles of tunnels underneath here but

434
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,569
after that this bear has been totally

435
00:13:24,569 --> 00:13:25,829
worthless he doesn't know where to go so

436
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:27,179
why did they even bother to haul him

437
00:13:27,179 --> 00:13:28,889
down here this actually works the people

438
00:13:28,889 --> 00:13:30,179
in this universe must be very slick

439
00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:31,980
Hellboy begins to levitate for a moment

440
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,449
this is about where the door was when

441
00:13:33,449 --> 00:13:35,040
manning slid through which means it

442
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,119
should be closed at this point unless

443
00:13:36,119 --> 00:13:37,619
the door immediately paused and only

444
00:13:37,619 --> 00:13:39,029
began moving again at this moment which

445
00:13:39,029 --> 00:13:40,529
would be very considerate of the door

446
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:42,480
really Lefty did you cut yourself again

447
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,860
or am I supposed to believe that's the

448
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,689
cut from a moment ago because that cut

449
00:13:45,689 --> 00:13:46,949
clearly happened on the back of your

450
00:13:46,949 --> 00:13:51,059
hand hey hey what's wrong with you

451
00:13:51,059 --> 00:13:53,399
seriously all cronin manages to do in

452
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:54,929
this situation is not kill anyone and

453
00:13:54,929 --> 00:13:56,369
break his own gramophone also why is

454
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:57,779
there a rope hanging right over the trap

455
00:13:57,779 --> 00:13:59,100
that's supposed to kill people and one

456
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,480
of the spikes come out after the victim

457
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,160
probably already fell to the ground well

458
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,120
you know feel that way about me you want

459
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,339
to know that here Wow

460
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:09,990
good question I don't even want to know

461
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:12,720
it all red white whatever guys are all

462
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,459
the same it sounds like a bad minions

463
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:16,290
meme about housewives and wine couldn't

464
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:17,519
they just hook Liz up with a bunch of

465
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:18,990
grenades and just have her charge in

466
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,699
here and blow all the monsters up she's

467
00:14:20,699 --> 00:14:22,019
like resistant to fire right

468
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:23,459
where is she only resistant to her own

469
00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:25,139
fire that's a very specific fire

470
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:27,839
resistant hit me earlier in the movie

471
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,459
Liz said she was beginning to control

472
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:30,959
her powers yet here she needs to be

473
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,249
slapped around a little in order to get

474
00:14:32,249 --> 00:14:34,139
her flame on also I thought small

475
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:35,790
instant measured amounts of sharp pain

476
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:36,959
were supposed to calm her down I'm

477
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,490
legitimately asking is she always

478
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:40,170
wearing fireproof clothes that seems

479
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,699
expensive she was so desperate to get

480
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:43,110
the flame going a moment ago but now

481
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:44,370
she's moseying like those creatures

482
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:45,870
aren't currently killing Hellboy in fact

483
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,549
he's resistant to fire so they could

484
00:14:47,549 --> 00:14:48,870
have won this a long time ago but they

485
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:50,639
needed the dramatics of Liz doing a Jean

486
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,420
Grey impression only Jean survives this

487
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:57,540
thank you for this

488
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,740
not only did John survive but so do

489
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,060
those grenades he can break through

490
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,860
extremely thick stone walls but these

491
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,300
normal sized chains are just too much

492
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:07,930
your stone implant what did you think it

493
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:10,270
was made for smashing things lighting on

494
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:10,720
fire

495
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,540
weird masturbation ah no let me get this

496
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,020
straight

497
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,400
some asshole built a portal to another

498
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,930
dimension that would release some sort

499
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:18,760
of badass apocalyptic creature but only

500
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,500
during an eclipse but first it required

501
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,730
Rasputin to open this gate in the

502
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:22,930
beginning of the movie and somehow give

503
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:24,550
birth to Hellboy who would then one day

504
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,230
grow big enough to use his arm as a key

505
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:28,210
I mean that is one convoluted prophecy

506
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:29,950
complete with convoluted carpentry and

507
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:31,450
witchcraft aboot John is now suddenly

508
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:32,950
able to slip free from his restraints

509
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:34,900
does Hellboy saying his real name apply

510
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,060
to everyone's restraints remember who

511
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:39,220
you are the real you is inside there

512
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,990
somewhere cliche did John just use the

513
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:42,580
Force to get those rosary beads to

514
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,960
Hellboy even though the monster was

515
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,160
halfway through the portal he just

516
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,210
disappears when it closes

517
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:47,440
instead of getting chopped in half or

518
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,870
something - lets go maybe you should

519
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,550
handle that situation let's quit coming

520
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,960
out of the evil dude seems like a pretty

521
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,710
big loose end

522
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:55,510
apocalyptic monster merely tosses hella

523
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:56,920
boy like a tennis ball instead of just

524
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,210
going ahead and killing him already on

525
00:15:58,210 --> 00:15:59,980
his clothes fireproof - what are the

526
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:04,850
rules

527
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:17,410
you

528
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:22,579
what is it that makes a man a man is it

529
00:16:22,579 --> 00:16:25,610
his origins the way things start sure

530
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:30,980

536
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:00,570

00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:02,160
abducted and the kidnappers started

538
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,000
sending me muffins in the mail out there

539
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,420
