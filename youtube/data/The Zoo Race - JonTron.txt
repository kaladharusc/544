52
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:31,300
I must recommend for you to read perhaps

53
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,630
some more informative books Nana frankly

54
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:35,320
I don't know what the fuck you're

55
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,400
talking about this is like the most

56
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,200
exciting shit it's a book about a guy

57
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,060
collecting every animal it's like the

58
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,190
original Pokemon there's always the

59
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:47,230
dictionary encyclopedias and also many

60
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:49,900
history books to choose from always dad

61
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,760
how you get smart deaf that would

62
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,350
explain it I've been trying for ages and

63
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:55,930
failing no Hannah I like books about

64
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:58,600
animals those other books are boring to

65
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,700
me and my dialogue was written by a

66
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,680
four-year-old look at his lady walking

67
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,970
down the hall once she gets in earshot

68
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:05,200
she's out of there

69
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,269
she's a smartest person in the room do

70
00:03:07,269 --> 00:03:08,890
you think that Noah had any creature

71
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:11,079
races in those days after the world

72
00:03:11,079 --> 00:03:13,090
flood now Ruben you know that's a loaded

73
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,820
question did Noah play and have fun with

74
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:16,510
the animals

75
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:17,799
no Ruben you know that's a loaded

76
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:20,799
question I think that maybe you read too

77
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:22,810
many books Ruben and Ruben this is a

78
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,970
librarian telling you this clearly she

79
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:26,290
can see you're a man who's been reading

80
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,269
one too many a dusty of skis great works

81
00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:30,880
it must be the vacant existential stare

82
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,549
that tipped her off you have too much

83
00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:37,090
imagination Ruben oh that's the hand of

84
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:39,700
a defeated man right there and you would

85
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,890
actually start in announce such a race

86
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:46,360
would it be God himself maybe ha ha Yeah

87
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,340
right ha ha yeah

88
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,540
that's totally the weirdest thing about

89
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,329
this actually I would love to but this

90
00:03:52,329 --> 00:03:54,430
is a very busy time of year for me I've

91
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:56,769
got my son's birthday and don't laugh at

92
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:58,300
me

93
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,190
now Hanna while this man's brain may be

94
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,810
filled with as many holes as a fine

95
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,370
Swiss cheese that's it that's the thing

96
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:05,810
you're gonna single out that he couldn't

97
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:09,200
announce a race but but you know that

98
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,900
God can do it because God can do

99
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,880
anything is anyone else getting the

100
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,500
feeling this conversation has about as

101
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,450
much depth as two five-year-olds arguing

102

136
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,419

they ever get you yeah I don't know what

141
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,510
I was expecting it would appear that a

142
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:29,180
man named taco Cohen wrote a whole seven

143
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,310
lines of code for this game what they do

144
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:33,950
it in C - - oh and by the way this is

145
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,510
very important to remember so write this

146
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:37,970

00:06:54,169 --> 00:06:55,099

00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,840
up all right time to pick a character I

168
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,060
guess what's with these titles

169
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:35,840
warrior courageous swim champion one of

170
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,140
these is not like the other one of them

171
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:41,210
fought and died for their cause the

172
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,860
other one there did a mean backstroke at

173
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:43,550
summer camp

174
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:45,620
well here's Tamar again yeah I'm just

175

gonna say I'm gonna say that's just a

176
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,920
fucking tiger I'm not so sure you can

177
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,690
get credit for making a 3d model of a

178
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:52,880
fucking tiger I think the only person

179
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,170
who should be credited for this if

180
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:56,180
anyone has got himself and I think you

181
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:58,160
know in light of this whole thing is a

182
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,780
bit blasphemous to try to take credit

183
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,760
for that or at the very least it's just

184
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,310
plagiarism priscila the pig I gotta hand

185
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,840

187
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:09,680
I can't put my finger on what it is you

188
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,880
know I'm gonna go with the pig because I

189
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,990
feel like you know maybe there's some

190
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,850
real dire consequences for not going

191
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:18,680
with the pig oh god you don't sound so

192

00:08:36,540 --> 00:09:02,280
the chest you know when I got on here to

201
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,870
play this game based on Noah's Ark I

202
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,160
remember saying to myself I said if they

203
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,290
don't have a shitty version of Van

204

206
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,630
here looks like one of Satan's boys is

207
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,310
trying to claw his way back to hell

208
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:19,080

209
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,970
at least eight lines of programming

listen man I'm really sorry about your

211
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:31,170
situation but I got a race to win this

212
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:37,170

216
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:47,500
should slap myself for saying that

getting the privilege to stare headlong

into Noah's dick Shalom

228
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:19,209

different ain't that like going to

230
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,000

233
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,510
is that is that him is that Noah oh here

234
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:38,170

235
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:41,890
coming in from downtown don't get Paul

236
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:48,010
Noah it's a lady hey there is nothing in

237
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:49,690
the known universe that science cannot

238
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:52,089
explain but this appears to be beyond

239
00:10:52,089 --> 00:10:54,760
the realm of Sciences is this meant to

240
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,339
test my faith or to lead me to faith

241
00:10:57,339 --> 00:10:59,410
also you maybe wanna you know set off a

242
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:00,760
few of those fireworks a bit farther

243
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,470
from the pig unless of course your aim

244
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,209
here is to make bacon rain which I admit

245
00:11:04,209 --> 00:11:09,550
is also a very admirable goal want to

246
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:11,110
run that by me one more time maybe this

247
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,820
time it's one less Vicodin jam down your

248
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,890
throat this game is a trainwreck of the

249
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:17,320
most beautiful kind the controls are

250
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,329
wonky the courses consist mostly of

251
00:11:19,329 --> 00:11:21,279
straightaways and 90-degree hairpin

252
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,290
turns and there doesn't seem to be any

253
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:25,120
ulterior goal except winning the race

254
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,620
and watching Noah through his magical

255
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,420

00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:33,940
you guys have given me conflicting

259
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:36,190
messages here this race is pirate and

260
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:38,440
Egyptian themed I'm pretty sure those

261
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,660
things existed at different times and I

262
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,459
think maybe one of them didn't even

263
00:11:42,459 --> 00:11:43,570
exist at all

264
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:47,920
all the gold is yours now also I'm the

265

Lincoln Memorial with gold or banana

peels my graphics aren't good enough to

267
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,579
jail you still get to stare my dick

268
00:11:57,579 --> 00:11:59,460

dude I don't think that was weed we just

271
00:12:04,369 --> 00:12:06,860
smoked everybody's up for Manoa partying

272
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:11,480
I was in the house and let me say no say

273
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,610
no to this many kids moms always say no

274
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:15,559
to drugs she also men say no to this

275
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:18,319
let's check out Seth's Safari avoid the

dinosaurs okay this one I got it this

277
00:12:20,299 --> 00:12:23,809
one makes sense to me okay maybe I

278
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:25,579
wasn't as ready as I thought no way

279
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:26,899
you're just trying to tenderize these

280
00:12:26,899 --> 00:12:28,249
animals so you can make a great steak

281
00:12:28,249 --> 00:12:30,079
later if so I gotta hand it to you the

282

Rube Goldberg approach is very unique I

283
00:12:32,269 --> 00:12:33,799
bet it took even longer to set up than

284
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:35,449
the boat you're a man of many talents

285

Lord

287
00:12:38,239 --> 00:12:40,429
and by praise the Lord I mean look at

288
00:12:40,429 --> 00:12:42,040
this bridge filled with dinosaurs

289
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,839
pterodactyls and a teetering station car

290
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:47,420
if that doesn't get the point of the

291
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:50,089
Lord across I just don't know what will

292
00:12:50,089 --> 00:12:54,499

the swimming contest but I'll never be

311
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:48,180
right in the head again really the only

312
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,200
part of this game that's actually

313
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,730
entertaining is seeing all the crazy

314
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:52,770
absurd concepts four levels and they're

315
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:55,410
extremely weird scripted events if you

316
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:57,450
can call them that most of the rest of

317
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:59,100
the game is just pure confusion

318
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,350
unadulterated lack of spatial

319
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:03,450
understanding okay I am not comfortable

320
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:05,190
with this that horse is way too eager to

321
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:07,800
get in that cannon what kind of state

322
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,390
you gotta be I mean what do you what do

323
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,220
you parents got to do to you for you to

324
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,570
turn out like this to make something

325
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:15,270
like this I don't even know what the

326
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:18,390
fuck she problem there's a bully's

327

cocaine boat from Miami but that's okay

328
