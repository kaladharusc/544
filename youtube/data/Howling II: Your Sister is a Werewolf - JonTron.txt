4
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:46,690
imagine if you will a reality in which a

5
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:49,450
population was so mediocre they produced

6
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:52,360
more bad films than good ones a reality

7
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,210
too ghastly to imagine well open your

8
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:58,030
eyes because there in that world that

9
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:59,260
world is the real one you wouldn't have

10
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,910
it and it's that's the one you're in

11
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,610
what should we fall day just like this

12
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:14,800
one it reminds me reminds me of so we

13
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,340
meet again

[Music]

15
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,540
probably shouldn't lift that on while I

16
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:53,200
was gone all right thank God it's just a

17
00:01:53,200 --> 00:02:02,890
crowd this Halloween we're gonna do

18
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,240
something real scary

19
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,340
we're gonna watch howling - your sister

20
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:11,200
is a werewolf whatever you go to

21
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,200
Kubrick's normal this film is also known

22
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,020
by its original name howling - sturby

23
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,330
werewolf bitch which if I'm being honest

24
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:20,980
it's got a pretty good ring to it I

25
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,390
don't know why they changed that this

26
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:24,880
film almost as if divinely appeared on

27
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,700
our planet in the year 1985 starring

28
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,250
legendary actor Christopher Lee may he

29
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,209
rest in peace

30
00:02:31,209 --> 00:02:33,550
it was poised for worldwide success in

31
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:36,070
acclaim or was it while Lee was

32
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:37,989
portrayed in a number of memorable roles

33
00:02:37,989 --> 00:02:40,030
such as Saruman the white and the rhymes

34
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:42,459
with poopoo count dooku from the worst

35
00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:44,769
star wars movie there were also some

36
00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:46,780
roles he may have preferred States Six

37
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,350
Feet Under

38
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,870
sealed away deep in a mausoleum to be

39
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:52,600
forgotten by man and lost to time

40
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,180
but alas we have the Internet and well

41
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,290
they they pretty much got everything on

42
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:57,760
there so it's pretty hard to hide stuff

43
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,160

and there it is howling to your sister's

53
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:27,740
a werewolf I'm feeling I'm gonna be

54
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:37,069
maybe howling a few minutes over here

55
00:03:37,069 --> 00:03:39,439
the film starts off at the funeral of a

56
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:41,329
woman who was recently killed the guy at

57
00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:42,950
the altar goes on about how everything

58
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:44,659
sucks for a few minutes really getting

59
00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:46,489
everyone into the spirit of things the

60
00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:49,700
death of anyone is a sad occasion even

61
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:53,209
Hitler nothing we can say or do can

62
00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:57,409
bring Karen back shortly thereafter the

63
00:03:57,409 --> 00:03:58,519
director points the camera and

64
00:03:58,519 --> 00:03:59,989
microphone in the wrong direction as

119
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,860
and yet the timing is impeccable the

120
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,750

00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:58,680
one

169
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,080
the tape that Stefan shows them depicts

170
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,420
this man's sister being murdered live on

171
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,530
broadcast as she turns into a werewolf

172
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:09,830
[Applause]

173
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:16,749
[Music]

174
00:09:16,749 --> 00:09:21,349
it's fake that's not my sister Ben I

175
00:09:21,349 --> 00:09:25,099
recognize those people proof Stephan

176
00:09:25,099 --> 00:09:26,989
also explains that the werewolves have a

177
00:09:26,989 --> 00:09:28,849
leader named Sterba and that it is his

178
00:09:28,849 --> 00:09:30,979
mission in life to destroy her once and

179
00:09:30,979 --> 00:09:31,639
for all

180
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:34,189
Stella must be destroyed and I won't do

181
00:09:34,189 --> 00:09:36,109
it I think at this point Chris really

182
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:37,669
just kind of starts to improv as lines

183
00:09:37,669 --> 00:09:39,409
or at least you know realize the

184
00:09:39,409 --> 00:09:41,689
magnitude of his regret on screen either

185
00:09:41,689 --> 00:09:42,949
way is beautiful

186
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:48,259
evolution is reversed how can you listen

187
00:09:48,259 --> 00:09:51,949

241
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:12,210
weird Dracula references have something

242
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:13,620
to do with the fact that Christopher Lee

243
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,810
used to play Dracula back in the 50s I

244
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:18,030

after you stabbed that lady who got hit

273
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:46,490
by the car in the heart I'm thinking

274
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:48,670
maybe you don't have the best judgment

275
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:52,400

house to get my tank licked so now we

282
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:09,800
arrive at the next setting of the film

283
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,930
what is supposedly a small Eastern

284
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:15,080
European town in Transylvania lovely

285
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,420

00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:35,750
has six floors thereafter Jenni brings

288
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,240

289
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,160
even further and she won't stop talking

290
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,350

291
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:44,870

where their mom is where's Stefan

293

I don't know what the hell we're doing

294
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:54,369

295
00:14:54,369 --> 00:15:06,220

296
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:10,189

315
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:56,449
night Jenny decides to take a bath and

316

331
00:16:49,579 --> 00:16:51,790

335
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:08,320

336
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,840
an email is Sabbath what do you want to

337
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:14,980

338
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,849

339
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:27,810
[Music]

340
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:35,490
[Applause]

341
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:45,540
I know that's right that one I can't

342
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,100
can't get can't get as much behind that

343
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,070
one what in the goddamn hell is

344
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:56,400
happening in this stupid movie lord then

345
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,190
now Stephane is like following a weird

346
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:00,990
little girl down an alleyway because she

347
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:03,510
has some locket yeah that's probably the

348
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,920
best course of action like there's no

349
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,940
one figured out that this set of

350
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:09,770
circumstances usually leads to a murder

351
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:11,700
still gonna follow her down the alley

352
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:15,320
little laughing girl alright let's do it

353
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:19,950
just two last question I have been

354
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:23,540
Gandalf

355
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:28,460

you all right no no actually I don't

357
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:33,540
think I'm ever gonna unsee that we must

358
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,400
leave for the castle tonight these are

359
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,580
our weapons the consecrated oil wax from

360
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:41,880
the sacred candles a dagger forged from

361
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,340
titanium and a chalice which held the

362
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,380
sacred blood of Christ oh you got that

363
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:49,920
and this is just a fucking gun I'll take

364
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,390
that yeah that's probably the best

365
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:53,880
choice also can we talk about how just

366
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,410
you know nobody bothered to ask how he

367
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:57,900
got the Holy Grail he just got that just

368
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,760
has that also that means Jesus has

369
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,260
proved real we're just gonna whiz on by

370
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,060

371
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:16,070
[Music]

372
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:18,320
so as we reach the climax Stephane

373
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,899
finally confronts turbo demons and

374
00:19:20,899 --> 00:19:24,889
powers of adversity bound and held

375
00:19:24,889 --> 00:19:30,259
subject to his will we meet again all of

376
00:19:30,259 --> 00:19:35,830

[Music]

378
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:45,280
in the name of God day I don't know what

379
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,990
the use of showing that guy's face was

380
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:49,060
dog cake now with dragons coming out of

381
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:51,040
it yeah hopefully the Christmas episode

382
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,290
isn't this weird so the curse is

383
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:56,050
reversed Sterba is killed and Ben and

384
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:58,000

387
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:14,290
told you this is Halloween they dress up

388
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:15,460
it's just a thing you know what forget

389
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:17,590
it you're a sweet kid just don't worry

390
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:20,740
about it your neighbors on your trial

391
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:28,030
just knocked on our door coming a little

392
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:33,640
later I hope so hey I think compared to

393
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,500
that I would have preferred my neighbor

394
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,170
was a werewolf oh by the way the sister

395
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,250
is still trapped in the crypt

396
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,050
screaming screaming forever is a

397
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:42,340
werewolf because no one laid her to rest

398
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,710
just thought I'd point that out okay now

399
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,300
here's the credits sequence and I don't

400
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,730
know if I can accurately impart how

401
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:49,780
ridiculous this is

402
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,520

403
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,530
from the beginning and I've not edited

405
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,180
beat of the music they loop this woman
