1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:10,349
Comcast look I know it takes a village

2
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:12,150
to get a movie made and that's expensive

3
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,250
but this is entirely too many logos east

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,130
and west do not mistrust each other

5
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,640
because we are armed we are armed

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,410
because we mistrust each other

7
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:27,689
Regan narration air Regan reading we

8
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:29,070
need to show we're in the eighties sir

9
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,019
we just opened with the mr. Gorbachev

10
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:32,820
speech from Reagan wearing a boy Eddie's

11
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,130
new order it is Sir and if you were

12
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,200
gonna shoot him why ran him twice I get

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,910
maybe ramming him once he was running

14
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:40,800
perpendicular to your car but ran him

15
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,300
again after that isn't that just a waste

16
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,710
of time when you plan on shooting him to

17
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,539
death in the end anyway a fat guy shot

18
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:47,219
another guy I don't know in one half of

19
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:48,989
Berlin during the Cold War so he could

20
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:50,670
steal his watch or some and I'm just

21
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:51,960
like this is a pretty good movie by the

22
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,460
end why does it have such a sketchy and

23
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:54,809
terrible opening who thought these first

24
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:56,370
three minutes were super compelling why

25
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:57,719
can't Charlize be in the opening scene

26
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:59,250
Charlize has now appeared in movies

27
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,870
where she takes a nice bath a milk bath

28
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:02,760
a couple of couples baths and at least

29
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,350
one regular bath what's next to Chipotle

30
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:06,900
baths a garlic bath a mud bath mr. pro

31
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,400
bath agenda has got to stop Charlie's

32
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,380
final rain is a big shot spy and

33
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,090
probably don't give a fuck but that

34
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:13,740
window is wide fucking open half of

35
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,210
London as a clear view of her Big Ben's

36
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:17,610
goddamn it is so washed out and filtered

37
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:18,600
it might as well be black and white

38
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,909
maybe that's the point but if it is the

39
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:22,380
point sure who doesn't keep their

40
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,240
expositional nostalgic pictures in a

41
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,890
random bathroom drawer I don't know I

42
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,630
just don't think this movie is 1989

43
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,100
enough can we maybe find a way to

44
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,630
squeeze in something about Pete Rose or

45
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:32,280
maybe Tim Burton's Batman Taylor Swift

46
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,140
Burt Louie news makeup to cover her

47
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,939
other facial injuries but I guess ran

48
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:37,170
out before she could get to the eyes

49
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:41,729
then well earlier ten days later text

50
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:43,140
I'm just now piecing together that this

51
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,399
movie is going to do the whole flashback

52
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,200
the entire movie a bit at a time while

53
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,520
the main character is being interrogated

54
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,020
or interviewed in the present thing from

55
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,090
well Titanic Slumdog Millionaire the

56
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:52,740
usual suspects young guns to Vanilla Sky

57
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,509
Mission Impossible three Hey - Tom

58
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:56,100
Cruise movies young guns - that Natalie

59
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,579
Portman SNL rap video Citizen Kane hey I

60
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:00,960
like this movie and it's already told me

61
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,310
this is based on a graphic novel but

62
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,229
this unnecessary spray paint graphic

63
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:05,880
labels make it look way too Suicide

64
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,890
Squad for me also only nine minutes into

65
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,780
the film it finally begins and honestly

66
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,400
the first nine minutes we're so bland

67
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,410
you better have one mother of a surprise

68
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:13,990
payoff in

69
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:16,300
or you know Russian is excellent and

70
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,120
expert in the escape-and-evasion

71
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,260
provision tin intelligence collection

72
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,660
atomic bond also what an expositional

73
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:25,060
resume we promised a spyglass immunity

74
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,220
in exchange for a document on microfilm

75
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,870
codenamed the list

76
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:31,090
wait the list is the codename for a list

77
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:33,190
that contains names of spies I even have

78
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,050
a codename tonight it's literally what

79
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:37,240
it is also movie rips off the list of

80
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,980
all the spies names MacGuffin from all

the spy movies David person he's on

82
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:42,640
number one in Berlin

83
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,490
he's your point of contact and 100%

84
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:47,140
certain to either be evil or have

85
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,700
ulterior motives if I've ever movie

86
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,440
before in my life and I have to strike

87
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,260
from the tip the Virgin Mary of all the

88
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,400
whiskey's in all the world this

89
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,990
character in this movie decided to crown

90
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:58,060
as champion Jack Daniels a fine enough

91
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,290
whiskey from my home state of Tennessee

92
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,060
that is in no way the best of the best

93
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,800
in which some would even argue is just

94
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,500
well marketed swill it's a russian world

95
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,750
bucket sideways but that's such an

96
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,250
ignorant thing to do if the Russians

97
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,900
love their children too this is highly

98
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,210
sensitive trust no one

99
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:15,430
Lorraine is a goddamn super spy dude do

100
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,960
you really have to spout this lazy crap

101
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,280
before she goes on a mission you

102
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,470
remember mr. Bremen bitches don't you of

103
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,450
course you do so you knew she was coming

104
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:23,680
planned to kill her but still announce

105
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,150
yourself like this and give her time to

106
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:30,220
reach down to her shoes despite this

107
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,660
potentially fatal conflict in the back

108
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,220
seat this motherfucker continues to

109
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,570
drive rather than stopping the car

110
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:35,620
getting out and shooting Lorraine

111
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,090
luckily this chase ended in the part of

112
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:38,530
West Berlin where you can easily dispose

113
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:40,090
of comatose henchmen in broad daylight

114
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:44,920
without anyone noticing you know what

115
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,570
probably doesn't blend in that expensive

116
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:48,220
ass sports car that's being haphazardly

117
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,930
driven in the middle of the day

118
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:56,269
[Music]

119
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:59,040
geumhui seasick REM effete waited until

120
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,660
now to ask this very important question

121
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:01,890
to one of his henchmen what the hell was

122
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:09,360
all the beating for then two versions of

123
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,799
Blue Monday were used for this movie and

124
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,019
neither one was by orgy so someone's

125
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,700
following her and she smokes got it

126
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,410
smokey sure wastes a lot of time doesn't

127
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:18,269
it I will not release this body without

128
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:20,160
to collect information it's a simple

129
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,350
mistake who's not in German if you don't

130
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:25,800
make simple mistakes wait what Lorraine

131
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,660
goes to complete the first item on her

132
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,310
to-do list gets denied by a mortician

133
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,960
and just pieces out to take a nice bath

134
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,150
the hell kind of spy is she also why

135
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:34,770
does she use ice pad stand I'm the pain

136
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,360
when plenty of legal and illegal but

137
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,889
easily obtainable drugs would do the job

138
00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:39,870
faster and with much less lugging of ice

139
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,310
buckets in Tirana

140
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,960
I can only assume that this expositional

141
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,400
dream sequence was inserted to spark

142
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,810
debate over whether or not Lorraine is a

143
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,370
replicant radio was embedded in your

144
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,020
headboard yet another idat8 he's got

145
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,580
wrong about the future and this movie

146
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,830
loves its mere shots maybe too much like

147
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,600
Charlie's went sole method during Snow

148
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,770
White and the Huntsman she started

149
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:57,389
demanding tons of mirrors in a contract

150
00:04:57,389 --> 00:04:59,639
I want satchel dead or alive he's a

151
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:01,770
black eye to the crown whoa that's

152
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:04,560
racist oh he said black hi carry on why

153
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,700
are these dick holes approaching so

154
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,080
cautiously just to give Lorraine enough

155
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,729
time to get set up for ask a curry dude

156
00:05:08,729 --> 00:05:10,590
you don't need to keep using the silent

157
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:12,150
motion tricks under the circumstances of

158
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:13,470
your partner being choked out by a

159
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:14,940
garden hose you can just tell your guys

160
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,889
what to do or even ask the rain what her

161
00:05:16,889 --> 00:05:21,930
deal is has anyone tried that

162
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:24,610
since this is Germany I'll assume this

163
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:29,770
is technically a Vilhelm screen this

164
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:31,570
movie confirms that yes women can also

165
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:32,440
be Jason Bourne

166
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,360
ah yes leaving a dog-eared copy of

167
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,530
Machiavelli's The Prince in the

168
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:37,000
foreground of Percival's house is an

169
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,260
extremely subtle way of letting us know

170
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,480
he's a selfish butthole no librarian is

171
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,270
Larry Flint champion of free speech this

172
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,830
is apparently the British spy version of

173
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:49,389
I only read it for the articles Jesus

174
00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:50,950
Christ this version of der Kommissar was

175
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,169
released in 1982 and has nothing to do

176
00:05:53,169 --> 00:05:54,490
with this era other than we're in

177
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:57,639
Germany also a hate der Kommissar this

178
00:05:57,639 --> 00:05:59,139
movie has more liquor product placement

179
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:01,270
than a fucking DJ Khaled music video had

180
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,889
a hard-on for Jack Daniels considering

181
00:06:02,889 --> 00:06:04,270
this movie is taking place in Cold War

182
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:09,190
Berlin in 1989 lucky us the fact that

183
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,720
this guy thinks he's being inconspicuous

184
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,120
sure it's good context for us but why

185
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,590
would Lorraine have all her different

186
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:16,360
passports laid out like this like what

187
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,530
if the housekeeper brings up extra

188
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:18,760
towels you don't think they're gonna see

189
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,229
that you should have applied for a

190
00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:22,270
visitor's permit what kind of work do

191
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:22,690
you do

192
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:24,970
legal affairs luckily for Lorraine she

193
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,560
found the one customs agent in East

194
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,180
Berlin that speaks perfect English hell

195
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,560
it's hard to find a customs agent that

196
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,570
speaks perfect English in the u.s.

197
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:35,710
you're only being stalked seeks refuge

198
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:41,580
in movie theater playing stalker movie

199
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:44,650
what was this assholes plan he had

200
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:46,060
beaten Lorraine to the point she would

201
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,890
be easily transportable but because he

202
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:49,450
kicked her through the pink screen and

203
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,680
took forever to walk through it he

204
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,840
fucking lost her was this assholes plan

205
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,490
despite all this commotion outside the

206
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:55,840
building Lorraine still finds a side

207
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,430
exit no one knows about or is covering

208
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,990
there are enough of these shots of long

209
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:00,940
luscious drags off of cigarettes in this

210
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,110
movie that it's pretty much become

211
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:03,520
smoked pork he's pondering how to tell

212
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,200
Charlize about the magic loom they get

213
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,910
their orders from I look for pleasure in

214
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:08,710
the details I'm sure what went wrong

215
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:10,600
here but this progressive lesbian Side

216
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,190
Story kills the movies momentum and I

217
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,479
can't help but wonder if it's Sophia

218
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:15,130
boot Ella's inability to sell this line

219
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:16,570
even a little bit well even though

220
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,039
nothing was really discussed except for

221
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:19,090
the fact that Delvians French

222
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:20,770
intelligence and she offered a somewhat

223
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:22,240
cryptic warning to me that's enough shop

224
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,710
Talk let's make the hell out she give

225
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:24,920
you

226
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,900
she gave me nothing I know you wanted to

227
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,280
give us a flashback of her clearly

228
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,110
giving Charlize information they had to

229
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:31,940
ask her this four times before she said

230
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:32,270
anything

231
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,800
what interrogator debriefers going to

232
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,970
believe your answer after thinking about

233
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:39,680
it for that long goodbye did you think

234
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,630
Christ howís baktun stayed alive this

235
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:43,130
long if he announces his presence then

236
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,780
walks up behind a fucking spy with no

237
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,250
clue of what he has in front of it The

238
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,080
Mummy on her tummy it's a nice shot but

239
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,790
up there all alone isn't this a pretty

240
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:51,290
conspicuous way to have a clandestine

241
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:53,120
spy talk sure maybe no one can hear you

242
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,320
but you're drawing all kinds of

243
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,580
attention to yourselves given that

244
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,050
there's nothing to do up on top of that

245
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:58,850
tiny platform to nowhere except have

246
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:01,130
clandestine conversations lamp lamp lamp

247
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:03,620
lamp lamp first of all is 97 kilograms

248
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:06,260
with translates to 213 pounds the only

249
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,520
way James McAvoy could weigh that much

250
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,290
as if all of his split personalities

251
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:10,790
were real and were included in this

252
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,200
measurement oh yeah thanks for

253
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,060
remembering James in almost 20 minutes

254
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,490
since the movie Jack Daniels approach is

255
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:19,280
the list I can't make mistakes I mean is

256
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,050
being a spy mostly just drinking in bars

257
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:22,940
drinking at home smoking cigarettes

258
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,620
being beautiful women and talking about

259
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,060
the mission because if so I could do at

260
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,070
least four of those five things instead

261
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:30,830
Percival kept it a secret putting us in

262
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:32,810
a precarious position a lot of

263
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:34,160
alliteration from anxious atomic

264
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,810
assassins attempting to assuage angry

265
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:37,610
Authority through auditory aspersion oh

266
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:39,590
yeah so that's still a thing I swear to

267
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:41,000
God Charlie's just took this role to

268
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,500
wear pretty clothes learn jujitsu

269
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,270
chain-smoked and cuddle Sylvia boot Ella

270
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:46,550
you tell the truth you look different

271
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:48,500
cute romantic moment but does she tell

272
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,180
the truth even one time prior to the

273
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,620
very last scene though here is a man

274
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,390
about to watch these two pick a lock on

275
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,010
a restricted subway door and then just

276
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:56,570
drive off on his merry way without ever

277
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:58,070
reporting it or yelling hey stop that

278
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,600
and while that may be what a real

279
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,160
underpaid subway worker would actually

280
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,470
do it's still a sin Oh off with it

281
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,150
already what tough goes up with a

282
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,920
skateboard the illegal passport

283
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,510
operation also makes or paints

284
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:10,010
skateboards or are you telling me that

285
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:11,660
one of the illegal passport operations

286
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,430
employees take skateboards to work every

287
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:17,750
day in East Berlin his family who knows

288
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,150
spine class is a spot so why the would

289
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,530
they just waltz into a meeting of spies

290
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:23,660
doing spiced about like a special knock

291
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:26,390
hey it's us shop I was admittedly a kid

292
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:28,250
when the Berlin Wall fell but was it

293
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,020
really known days in advance what day

294
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,400
and time it was gonna come down this

295
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,960
movie makes it sound like it was I don't

296
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,340
remember that being the case I thought

297
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,870
it was more spontaneous than that a bit

298
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,220
again my textbooks taught me the

299
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:37,939
Christopher Columbus

300
00:09:37,939 --> 00:09:39,049
was awesome at everything and never did

301
00:09:39,049 --> 00:09:40,909
a bad thing so my education is up for

302
00:09:40,909 --> 00:09:42,559
debate when you have Prince alien then

303
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:44,419
being shoot them Jesus what is this

304
00:09:44,419 --> 00:09:46,339
asshole waiting for the 1961 Lincoln

305
00:09:46,339 --> 00:09:52,429
Continental convertible she bounces

306
00:09:52,429 --> 00:09:53,749
there right in the middle of a goddamn

307
00:09:53,749 --> 00:09:55,789
firefight with multiple bad guys on

308
00:09:55,789 --> 00:09:57,079
their ass and Lorraine leaves this

309
00:09:57,079 --> 00:09:58,669
mother here by himself in the middle of

310
00:09:58,669 --> 00:10:00,349
a fucking Lobby I don't care if this is

311
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:02,530
an unreliable narrative that's whack

312
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:05,169
[Applause]

313
00:10:05,169 --> 00:10:07,729
furiosa origins I have to hand it to

314
00:10:07,729 --> 00:10:09,589
this movie for this seemingly uncut shot

315
00:10:09,589 --> 00:10:11,419
of a brutal and claustrophobic fight and

316
00:10:11,419 --> 00:10:13,759
even if it's a little boredom it doesn't

317
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:15,319
have that shaky-cam aesthetic so it's

318
00:10:15,319 --> 00:10:16,849
pretty cool original and awesome and

319
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:19,939
long and awesome three cents off god

320
00:10:19,939 --> 00:10:21,079
damn it just when I give this movie

321
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:22,579
props for this fight scene they got a

322
00:10:22,579 --> 00:10:24,259
tough King villain pulls a knife midway

323
00:10:24,259 --> 00:10:27,319
through the fight cliche luckily for

324
00:10:27,319 --> 00:10:28,789
Lorraine and spyglass these KGB

325
00:10:28,789 --> 00:10:30,409
dickheads not only have stormtrooper aim

326
00:10:30,409 --> 00:10:32,299
they immediately abandon the successful

327
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:33,619
strategy of shooting through the wall I

328
00:10:33,619 --> 00:10:35,509
thought these KGB boys had radios and

329
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:37,309
which was how they were communicating

330
00:10:37,309 --> 00:10:39,169
during the protest but no one calls to

331
00:10:39,169 --> 00:10:40,639
let their comrades know that this ass

332
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:41,599
beating is taking place

333
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,309
you guys can punch and kick all you want

334
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,779
but if you stay in this room to do it

335
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:46,249
odds are you're both going to die from

336
00:10:46,249 --> 00:10:48,079
the explosion or fire caused by any of

337
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:49,459
the eight things touching this radiator

338
00:10:49,459 --> 00:10:51,439
back here under the window wait so the

339
00:10:51,439 --> 00:10:52,939
dude that got his eyes gouged out and

340
00:10:52,939 --> 00:10:54,559
its throat ripped open somehow runs

341
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:56,089
these mother whores down for one last

342
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:57,379
hurrah I haven't seen a villain

343
00:10:57,379 --> 00:10:58,759
resurrection this contrived since the

344
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:00,409
very end of die hard Lorraine backs up

345
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:01,879
easily down the street even though the

346
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:03,259
asshole that shot at them wrecked and

347
00:11:03,259 --> 00:11:04,639
totally blocked it I guess the bad guys

348
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:05,959
in this movie are basically video game

349
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:07,399
characters that disappear a few seconds

350
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:08,749
after they were vanquished at this point

351
00:11:08,749 --> 00:11:10,309
I'm gonna have to create a new sudden

352
00:11:10,309 --> 00:11:12,109
side view of a car definitely means

353
00:11:12,109 --> 00:11:13,249
there's about to be a terrible wreck

354
00:11:13,249 --> 00:11:15,199
leisure Lorraine and therefore movie has

355
00:11:15,199 --> 00:11:20,929
time for this god damnit doesn't anyone

356
00:11:20,929 --> 00:11:22,669
know how to approach a fucking spy in

357
00:11:22,669 --> 00:11:27,769
this movie hmm pretty sure I've gotten

358
00:11:27,769 --> 00:11:29,479
spine glass and satchel confused given

359
00:11:29,479 --> 00:11:31,309
that they are both unknown s named spy

360
00:11:31,309 --> 00:11:33,079
people in this does the movie know how

361
00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:34,699
unnecessarily complicated this all is

362
00:11:34,699 --> 00:11:39,240
Christ no one in Germany believed

363
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,470
you mean Lorraine who was extremely

364
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:42,910
freaked out injured and desperately

365
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,770
searching for a bug in a room stopped to

366
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,480
turn on the TV to listen to the news

367
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,160
she's smoking a blunt and bawling her

368
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,530
eyes out she's so sad about weed and

369
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:51,760
after all the scuffling the

370
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,170
back-and-forth the knife in the back and

371
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,580
all the bull he still ends up

372
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,500
successfully strangling her good for him

373
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,510
wait calm the hell on I know it's

374
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,100
emotional that Delphine was killed but

375
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,110
Lorraine neither attempt CPR nor tries

376
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:03,730
to immediately chase after the person

377
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:10,150
she knows did it say any one question

378
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:12,670
after you asked one well my best guess

379
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:15,310
is Marlborough also fourth-wall breaking

380
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:16,930
in the final act of a movie that already

381
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:18,670
has an unreliable narrator gonzo

382
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,290
aesthetics and too many flashes forward

383
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:21,970
and backwards to count I think we've

384
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,410
already broken all the narrative rules

385
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,150
thank you very much oh no don't touch

386
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,770
that sweet sweet Tennessee whiskey that

387
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:30,790
obviously funded this movie for

388
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,770
conscience after all you've done yeah

389
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:36,660
that's a good point actually

390
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:39,550
nice people that guys didn't hear the

391
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,900
difference I'm sure I've seen a more

392
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,030
dramatic death scene like probably Talia

393
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,770
al Ghul from The Dark Knight Rises but

394
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:46,050
this one is up there

395
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:48,250
David basketball have you been listening

396
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,980
dude not only yes she did and yes she

397
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,750
has but also she kind of had a good

398
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,910
reason there's the list alright I know

399
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:55,930
no oh

400
00:12:55,930 --> 00:13:00,890
Borges this works

401
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:03,480
Luby waits until it moves to Paris

402
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,190
before playing the most London s song

403
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:12,450
ever god dammit doesn't anyone know how

404
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:13,830
to approach a fucking spy in this movie

405
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:15,360
I haven't seen this many feathers in the

406
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,040
air during a shootout since true romance

407
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,660
before you die I want to get this

408
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,190
through your thick primitive skull

409
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:21,600
because I'm multum Utley kind of the

410
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,190
villain in this movie and I'm the only

411
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:24,720
one that hasn't properly revealed the

412
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,490
totality of my plan yet damn it yeah

413
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:29,040
triple agent you never saw that coming

414
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,540
unless you've seen a few movies before

415
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,190
this way in which case this final whammy

416
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:33,810
ends up falling flat and feeling a bit

417
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:36,480
too hungry let's go home so not only is

418
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,490
mi6 barely worried about this extremely

419
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:40,050
dangerous and stupidly named the list

420
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:40,530
anymore

421
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:41,640
they're letting one of their most prized

422
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:48,740
assets lead the country

423
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:56,400
Jared you like this shit back here

424
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:00,240
excuse me my associates and I we uh we

425
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,590
made a little bet on what you do for a

426
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:01,890
living

427
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:06,200
and I won Tommy

428
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:11,310
of the beeping

429
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:23,180
this is the end shall we begin

430
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:26,190
it's never been like this in Berlin you

431
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:27,810
should have become a poet they should

432
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:30,740
have said oh this is highly sensitive

433
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:38,000
trust no one
