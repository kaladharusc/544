1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,480
How's it going bros?

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,800
My name is Maaaaaaarkiplier

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:06,300
*laughs*

4
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:15,760
LWIAY intro song

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,500
Welcome to LWIAY

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,740
Last week you,

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:20,840

8
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:21,560
Are...

9
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,869
LWIAY the show where you guys think you make fun of me

10
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:30,360
But I make fun of you because I get all the revenue

11
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:35,369
Damn it. Alright, let's see what kind of memes you guys posted this week.

12
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:36,820
haha

13
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:40,060
Ohhh I'm sure they're gonna be so nice. What do we got?

14
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:43,049
new meme, new meme, new meme, meme review

15
00:00:43,049 --> 00:00:44,980
*laughs*

16
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:47,500
Stop saying that I kill memes

17
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,040
I make memes better

18
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,360
&quot;Bonus meme gets hit on the far side of the screen&quot;

19
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,520
*laughs*

20
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,870
the real reason there was no bonus meme

21
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:01,900
(reads) AH Yes the two genders

22
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:05,540
hoes and man

23
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:06,040
Ah

24
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,229
Yes, the intellectual

25
00:01:08,229 --> 00:01:10,030
expression of the genders

26
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:14,260
speaking of Daisy from Star Wars that reminds me of the good old meme

27
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:16,000
[Daisy Ridley] That represents people of all genders

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,500
Two genders. All races and A...

29
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,500
(pewds laughs)

30
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,500
That's right

31
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,400
Your move Lip Tards

32
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,799
*Laughs*

33
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,090
I made a portrait painting of Pewds. I hope you like it

34
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:36,250
I know I'm supposed to be thankful and I'm know I'm supposed to be happy, but is my nose really that big?

35
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:41,470
Thank you very much.
Press F to pay respect. Keyboard cat

36
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:47,680
Ah, Keyboard cat. I thought it was just a puppet. This whole time. He had the hand up in the puppet.

37
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:54,790
And then that's how he played how is it possible? Oh my God did Bento actually play the keyboard what?

38
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,880
That's incredible

39
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,280
Bento! Ah, no Bento!

40
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:07,270
Universals picture source of income movies and own content Pewdiepie's videos, that's right

41
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:12,700
Basically for those who you don't know my last meme review video got

42
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,660
Demonetized by- oh it's back. That's right!

43
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,300
(He's a little happy)

44
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,880
*laughs*

45
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,360
MY revenune! MY money!

46
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,129
Good

47
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:26,320
Justice has been restored

48
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,560
When you're not invited to YouTube Rewind.

49
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:36,000
When you're not invited to HowToBasic face reveal. that's correct. I wasn't invited. that's it. yes

50
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,610
That's what happened. I am NOT, howtobasic

51
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:46,239
Upvote if you can hear this image, stop, we need to let this meme go you can have the chair meme

52
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:51,989
But this meme has to go, you go to YouTube gaming and it's literally all Fortnite

53
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:58,870
It's all Fortnite. It's all Fortnite. It's all Fortnite. Everyone is playing Fortnite

54
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,579
god damn it

55
00:03:00,579 --> 00:03:07,750
I was banned from every gaming Royale game of all time because of this meme so let it go

56
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:13,980
When Marzia is in a PewDiePie video: a surprise to be sure but a welcome one

57
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:21,000
Man, the prequel memes have to be the best group of memes coming out of one source of entertainment

58
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,740
I feel like it deserves its own video

59
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,120
Probably will do it later this week

60
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,580
*Piano playing in video*

61
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:39,490
your mom gay

62
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:48,220
Why is the FBI meme still clinging about all the memes that I rate the lowest are the ones that keep going

63
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:56,500
Except the chair forget the handshakes awkward hugs is where it's at who took this?

64
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:01,020
Who took this, and why do you hug? It's like can I have a hug?

65
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,640
uuuuuuuh... Yeah... sure... here

66
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:07,480
There you go. Are you happy are you happy?

67
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:13,360
*reads comment* These clothes look exactly like my dealers. Thank you. Thank you so much

68
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,340
LWIAY HAS ARRIVED

69
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:19,060
*laughs*

70
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,360
oh, That's great, I'm gonna steal that right away

71
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,560
good meme good meme bravo

72
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,920
A picture of Pewdiepie made of pictures of Markiplier

73
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,200
Are they crying Markiplier ones?

74
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,720
I don't think sooo

75
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,840
Too bad. Try again next time

76
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:38,440
I want the crying PewDiePie out of crying Markipliers,  then I'll be impressed

77
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,270
Stop wasting my time

78
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:43,600
Will PewDiePie ever died?

79
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,000
Translated into Greek, and then translated Greek into English

80
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,900
The PewDiePie will never die

81
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:57,100
If there has ever been more solid evidence to show the fact that I have never died

82
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:00,190
Then let this be it

83
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:07,780
When you find me dead you will find me not dead, I'm SchrÃ¶dinger's cat, you can't kill what is already dead.

84
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:12,820
Upvote so pewds can give answers. OK so basically what happened was I was

85
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,120
*bunch of reversed sentences*
(Repainting my gundam and then it got on my hand)

86
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,600
 

87
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,720
what is this? *shouts in agony*

88
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,720
Stop, stupid BIRD!

89
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,060
*laughs*

90
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,540
hmmmm

91
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:29,580
Which one should I pick as my wife? Too bad!

92
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:34,040
Natsuki is trash. I'm sorry Marzia. I'm going with Monika!

93
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,840
*pewds' signature anime voice* hell yeah man

94
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,700
New LWIAY video an accurate amount of people watching

95
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:43,440
BONUS meme

96
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,280
ohhh

97
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:50,820
You know I film the bonus meme every time no matter what just know that.think of all the lost memes

98
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,880
Let's have a moment of appreciation for that .

99
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,960
All the lost memes that will never see the light of day

100
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:00,490
Posted this last week got a ton of support but didn't make it to LWIAY people were saying

101
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:05,160
This should be Felix new avi for YouTube, so I'm posting it again. That's really cool

102
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,570
I would love to use it

103
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:10,700
But it looks way too professional for anything to be associated with me. okay?

104
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:15,220
Here on the Pewdiepie channel we're stuck with mediocresy

105
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:18,240
If it gets above that then you know something's up, okay?

106
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,560
You know something is wrong. So thank you, but no thank you

107
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,000
When you see how big his mousepad is

108
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,100
That's right

109
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,180
How do you think I got a girl like Marzia?

110
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:33,800
What the heck is this picture? It's absolutely terrifying. What's wrong with her eyes?

111
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,340
What's wrong with her eyes?

112
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:41,880
I'm scared. I'm scared of going home now. Am I dating a reptilian monster? Jesus

113
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:47,620
three means with no bonus memes - 2 memes with one bonus meme

114
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,720
What it's very different?

115
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:55,960
For the average view or maybe you haven't been on the channel long enough to really graph the idea behind the bonus meme

116
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:05,440
But it's a it's a very much different thing. That's right. *more reversed crap* (Help me speak please)

117
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:12,120
It's Felix, Sive

118
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:17,960
I wonder what's it going to say?

119
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:23,960
Give this shirt to Brad

120
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:30,280
Good meme good meme everybody you guys are creative sometimes of course not always

121
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,660
Upvote this so I can see the horror in pewds face

122
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:37,060
It's 369... THAT'S A GREAT PRICE

123
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,200
369!!!!!

124
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,320
And you can do 69 on it!

125
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:45,560
Look! It's super easy! You're welcome! We're dropping the price!

126
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,440
It's 369!

127
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,500
It's 369! It's 369!

128
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,720
THIS IS OUR JOINT

129
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,760
when you're a successful fashion designer

130
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:58,340
businesswoman and a huge youtube personality having

131
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:06,520
7.21 million subscribers, but everyone on r/PewDiePie submissions treats you like an innocent ten-year-old girl

132
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:12,880
A woke, Marzia meme seal of approval well done whoever did this. I couldn't agree more of course

133
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:17,149
And there it is!

134
00:08:17,149 --> 00:08:24,640
Oh my God so cute, she just looks just like Natsuki if only they' switch the shirt and the skirt my god

135
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,620
So kawaii desu ne

136
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,509
Too bad Natsuki is the worst girl

137
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:35,440
I'm sorry Marzia you're despicable and this makes me like you even less. I love you. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry

138
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,860
I'm Fridays with Pewdiepie. Dr. Strange oh

139
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,100
Oh we're using made-up names

140
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,160
Then I am LWAIY

141
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:49,100
Alright yeah, this is Fridays with Pewdiepie by the way I forgot to tell you. How's it going bros?

142
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,050
Welcome to fridays with pewdiepie

143
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:53,500
It's definitely different from LWAIY

144
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,800
Complains about flexing on youtube meanwhile

145
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,760
Oh come on. I can't show off my ride? I was proud of that thing

146
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:08,000
It's got Korean wheels and a double clutch engine you can't hate on me for flexing a little bit

147
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:15,360
Come on guys. I loved when I did that video everyone gets so salty like everyone just went into defense mode

148
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,400
NO

149
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,760
No, I don't flex. What are you talking about?

150
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,500
Have I told you about my chair?

151
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,129
You guys are honestly the most

152
00:09:25,129 --> 00:09:28,990
Awesome overwhelmingly supportive my favorite group of people

153

154
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:42,760
Never stop Pewds! optimism is great. Ah such a sweet post read the first letter of each line fam

155
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,100
Maybe you should read the first letter of mine.

156

YouTube's favourite show! Thank you guys for watching and supporting and posting the memes keep posting the memes in the subreddit

160
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,120
It's right there. Have a good laugh

161
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,940
And be immortalized on the Pewdiepie's subreddit

162
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:03,840
Think about it

163
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,260
Not too looong!

164
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,960
Since this is fridays with Pewdiepie

165
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,100
Guys, I love you so much

166
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:14,880
I do not have a twisted opinion about what some people on the Internet sees me as and

167
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:20,360
Just overly emphasize the fact that there's some sort of love connection going on here even though

168
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:25,400
I probably will never meet you, but I do love you very much

169
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,720
I love you guys so much. You're my soul. You're my entity.

170
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,760
You're my being.

171
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,740
if I ever meet you. I won't shake your hand, but I will awkwardly hug you

172
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,460
Food for thought

173
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,660
And as always

174
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,360
Brofist!

175
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,700
