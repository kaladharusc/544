1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,480
How's it going bros?

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,800
My name is Maaaaaaarkiplier

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:06,300
*laughs*

4
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:15,760
LWIAY intro song

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,500
Welcome to LWIAY

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,740
Last week you,

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:20,840

8
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:21,560
Are...

9
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,869
LWIAY the show where you guys think you make fun of me

10
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:30,360
But I make fun of you because I get all the revenue

11
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:35,369
Damn it. Alright, let's see what kind of memes you guys posted this week.

12
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:36,820
haha

13
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:40,060
Ohhh I'm sure they're gonna be so nice. What do we got?

14
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:43,049
new meme, new meme, new meme, meme review

15
00:00:43,049 --> 00:00:44,980
*laughs*

16
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:47,500
Stop saying that I kill memes

17
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,040
I make memes better

18
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,360
&quot;Bonus meme gets hit on the far side of the screen&quot;

19
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,520
*laughs*

20
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,870
the real reason there was no bonus meme

21
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:01,900
(reads) AH Yes the two genders

22
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:05,540
hoes and man

23
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:06,040
Ah

24
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,229
Yes, the intellectual

25
00:01:08,229 --> 00:01:10,030
expression of the genders

26
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:14,260
speaking of Daisy from Star Wars that reminds me of the good old meme

27
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:16,000
[Daisy Ridley] That represents people of all genders

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,500
Two genders. All races and A...

29
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,500
(pewds laughs)

30
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,500
That's right

31
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,400
Your move Lip Tards

32
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,799
*Laughs*

33
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,090
I made a portrait painting of Pewds. I hope you like it

34
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:36,250
I know I'm supposed to be thankful and I'm know I'm supposed to be happy, but is my nose really that big?

35
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:41,470
Thank you very much.
Press F to pay respect. Keyboard cat

36
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:47,680
Ah, Keyboard cat. I thought it was just a puppet. This whole time. He had the hand up in the puppet.

37
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:54,790
And then that's how he played how is it possible? Oh my God did Bento actually play the keyboard what?

38
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,880
That's incredible

39
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,280
Bento! Ah, no Bento!

40
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:07,270
Universals picture source of income movies and own content Pewdiepie's videos, that's right

41
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:12,700
Basically for those who you don't know my last meme review video got

42
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,660
Demonetized by- oh it's back. That's right!

43
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,300
(He's a little happy)

44
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,880
*laughs*

45
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,360
MY revenune! MY money!

46
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,129
Good

47
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:26,320
Justice has been restored

48
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,560
When you're not invited to YouTube Rewind.

49
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:36,000
When you're not invited to HowToBasic face reveal. that's correct. I wasn't invited. that's it. yes

50
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,610
That's what happened. I am NOT, howtobasic

51
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:46,239
Upvote if you can hear this image, stop, we need to let this meme go you can have the chair meme

52
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:51,989
But this meme has to go, you go to YouTube gaming and it's literally all Fortnite

53
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:58,870
It's all Fortnite. It's all Fortnite. It's all Fortnite. Everyone is playing Fortnite

54
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,579
god damn it

55
00:03:00,579 --> 00:03:07,750
I was banned from every gaming Royale game of all time because of this meme so let it go

56
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:13,980
When Marzia is in a PewDiePie video: a surprise to be sure but a welcome one

57
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:21,000
Man, the prequel memes have to be the best group of memes coming out of one source of entertainment

58
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,740
I feel like it deserves its own video

59
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,120
Probably will do it later this week

60
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,580
*Piano playing in video*

61
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:39,490
your mom gay

62
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:48,220
Why is the FBI meme still clinging about all the memes that I rate the lowest are the ones that keep going

63
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:56,500
Except the chair forget the handshakes awkward hugs is where it's at who took this?

64
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:01,020
Who took this, and why do you hug? It's like can I have a hug?

65
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,640
uuuuuuuh... Yeah... sure... here

66
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:07,480
There you go. Are you happy are you happy?

67
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:13,360
*reads comment* These clothes look exactly like my dealers. Thank you. Thank you so much

68
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,340
LWIAY HAS ARRIVED

69
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:19,060
*laughs*

70
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,360
oh, That's great, I'm gonna steal that right away

71
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,560
good meme good meme bravo

72
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,920
A picture of Pewdiepie made of pictures of Markiplier

73
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,200
Are they crying Markiplier ones?

74
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,720
I don't think sooo

75
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,840
Too bad. Try again next time

76
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:38,440
I want the crying PewDiePie out of crying Markipliers,  then I'll be impressed

77
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,270
Stop wasting my time

78
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:43,600
Will PewDiePie ever died?

79
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,000
Translated into Greek, and then translated Greek into English

80
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,900
The PewDiePie will never die

81
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:57,100
If there has ever been more solid evidence to show the fact that I have never died

82
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:00,190
Then let this be it

83
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:07,780
When you find me dead you will find me not dead, I'm Schrödinger's cat, you can't kill what is already dead.

84
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:12,820
Upvote so pewds can give answers. OK so basically what happened was I was

85
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,120
*bunch of reversed sentences*
(Repainting my gundam and then it got on my hand)

86
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,600
 

87
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,720
what is this? *shouts in agony*

88
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,720
Stop, stupid BIRD!

89
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,060
*laughs*

90
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,540
hmmmm

91
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:29,580
Which one should I pick as my wife? Too bad!

92
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:34,040
Natsuki is trash. I'm sorry Marzia. I'm going with Monika!

93
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,840
*pewds' signature anime voice* hell yeah man

94
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,700
New LWIAY video an accurate amount of people watching

95
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:43,440
BONUS meme

96
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,280
ohhh

97
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:50,820
You know I film the bonus meme every time no matter what just know that.think of all the lost memes

98
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,880
Let's have a moment of appreciation for that .

99
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,960
All the lost memes that will never see the light of day

100
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:00,490
Posted this last week got a ton of support but didn't make it to LWIAY people were saying

101
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:05,160
This should be Felix new avi for YouTube, so I'm posting it again. That's really cool

102
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,570
I would love to use it

103
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:10,700
But it looks way too professional for anything to be associated with me. okay?

104
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:15,220
Here on the Pewdiepie channel we're stuck with mediocresy

105
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:18,240
If it gets above that then you know something's up, okay?

106
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,560
You know something is wrong. So thank you, but no thank you

107
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,000
When you see how big his mousepad is

108
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,100
That's right

109
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,180
How do you think I got a girl like Marzia?

110
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:33,800
What the heck is this picture? It's absolutely terrifying. What's wrong with her eyes?

111
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,340
What's wrong with her eyes?

112
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:41,880
I'm scared. I'm scared of going home now. Am I dating a reptilian monster? Jesus

113
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:47,620
three means with no bonus memes - 2 memes with one bonus meme

114
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,720
What it's very different?

115
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:55,960
For the average view or maybe you haven't been on the channel long enough to really graph the idea behind the bonus meme

116
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:05,440
But it's a it's a very much different thing. That's right. *more reversed crap* (Help me speak please)

117
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:12,120
It's Felix, Sive

118
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:17,960
I wonder what's it going to say?

119
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:23,960
Give this shirt to Brad

120
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:30,280
Good meme good meme everybody you guys are creative sometimes of course not always

121
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,660
Upvote this so I can see the horror in pewds face

122
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:37,060
It's 369... THAT'S A GREAT PRICE

123
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,200
369!!!!!

124
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,320
And you can do 69 on it!

125
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:45,560
Look! It's super easy! You're welcome! We're dropping the price!

126
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,440
It's 369!

127
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,500
It's 369! It's 369!

128
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,720
THIS IS OUR JOINT

129
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,760
when you're a successful fashion designer

130
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:58,340
businesswoman and a huge youtube personality having

131
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:06,520
7.21 million subscribers, but everyone on r/PewDiePie submissions treats you like an innocent ten-year-old girl

132
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:12,880
A woke, Marzia meme seal of approval well done whoever did this. I couldn't agree more of course

133
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:17,149
And there it is!

134
00:08:17,149 --> 00:08:24,640
Oh my God so cute, she just looks just like Natsuki if only they' switch the shirt and the skirt my god

135
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,620
So kawaii desu ne

136
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,509
Too bad Natsuki is the worst girl

137
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:35,440
I'm sorry Marzia you're despicable and this makes me like you even less. I love you. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry

138
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,860
I'm Fridays with Pewdiepie. Dr. Strange oh

139
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,100
Oh we're using made-up names

140
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,160
Then I am LWAIY

141
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:49,100
Alright yeah, this is Fridays with Pewdiepie by the way I forgot to tell you. How's it going bros?

142
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,050
Welcome to fridays with pewdiepie

143
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:53,500
It's definitely different from LWAIY

144
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,800
Complains about flexing on youtube meanwhile

145
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,760
Oh come on. I can't show off my ride? I was proud of that thing

146
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:08,000
It's got Korean wheels and a double clutch engine you can't hate on me for flexing a little bit

147
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:15,360
Come on guys. I loved when I did that video everyone gets so salty like everyone just went into defense mode

148
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,400
NO

149
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,760
No, I don't flex. What are you talking about?

150
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,500
Have I told you about my chair?

151
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,129
You guys are honestly the most

152
00:09:25,129 --> 00:09:28,990
Awesome overwhelmingly supportive my favorite group of people

153

I am so lucky to have you okay, so it reads you mom gay. Haha so clever am I right

154
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:42,760
Never stop Pewds! optimism is great. Ah such a sweet post read the first letter of each line fam

155
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,100
Maybe you should read the first letter of mine.

156

It's right there. Have a good laugh

161
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,940
And be immortalized on the Pewdiepie's subreddit

162
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:03,840
Think about it

163
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,260
Not too looong!

00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,960
Since this is fridays with Pewdiepie

165
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,100
Guys, I love you so much

166
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:14,880
I do not have a twisted opinion about what some people on the Internet sees me as and

167
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:20,360
Just overly emphasize the fact that there's some sort of love connection going on here even though

168
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:25,400
I probably will never meet you, but I do love you very much

169
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,720
I love you guys so much. You're my soul. You're my entity.

170
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,760
You're my being.

171
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,740
if I ever meet you. I won't shake your hand, but I will awkwardly hug you

172
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,460
Food for thought

173
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,660
And as always

174
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,360
Brofist!

175
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,700
