time

14
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,670

15
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:00,909
make a movie about a killer tire but you

16
00:02:00,909 --> 00:02:02,430

18
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,330
after years and years of being asked to

19
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,760
review this stinker I'm finally gonna

20
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,810

want to thank that yeah

25
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:30,400
any what I figure I explain what you're

26
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,140
about to see as an excuse to why it

27
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,150
exists isn't that like a poet explaining

28
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,070
what a poem is in the poem are you

29
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:39,280
peddling bad sounds even deeper maybe

30
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,660
you should just get to the review yeah

31
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,460
okay let's take a look at the film you

32
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:45,640
have to see to believe and you have to

33
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:53,480
believe to see

34
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:58,720
oh okay I get it go like this

35
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,330
I'm not we got it otherwise he's not

36
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:07,120
gonna start the review right

37
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,660
yeah I blew your mind

38
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:20,840
let's take a look at rubber

39
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,150
it may not be that nostalgic but I'm

40
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,800
sick to death of getting requests for it

41
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,230
so here it is an actual movie about a

42
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:30,620
killer tire released in 2011 rubber is

43
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,569
another one of those polarizing films

44
00:03:32,569 --> 00:03:34,250
where critics seem to like it okay but

45
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,980
audiences felt very disappointed it's a

46
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,989
movie about a killer tire you dumbass is

47
00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:40,459
quite frankly you deserve whatever movie

48
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:42,739
they give you there is no bar to meet so

49
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:44,720
is there a secret gem that's smarter

50
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,700
than it looks or is it so bad that even

51
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,769
people who pay to see a killer tire feel

52
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:51,349
let down again I don't know how you let

53
00:03:51,349 --> 00:03:54,170
a crowd like that down well it might

54
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:56,329
sound strange but this film is worth a

55
00:03:56,329 --> 00:03:58,730
deeper analysis so let's take a look at

56
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:00,349
critic why do we have to watch this from

57
00:04:00,349 --> 00:04:02,959
a distance it's symbolic of what well if

58
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,760
you have to ask you clearly don't get it

59
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,400
I know that's why I asked he's so naive

60
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,860
he is such a jackass let's take a look

61
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:13,970
at rubber we open our film with you know

62
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:16,010
you have one job show attire that's a

63
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:17,600
chair I can see why people hated this

64
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,639
just when you're wondering if this is an

65
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:21,979
Ikea uprising a car shows up knocking

66
00:04:21,979 --> 00:04:27,440
them all down so this is an Amish

67
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,320
driving test forget it buddy even that

68
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,910
amount of binoculars won't help you find

69
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:35,419
the plot a man in a cop uniform gets out

70
00:04:35,419 --> 00:04:36,950
of the trunk and gets a glass of water

71
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,660
from the driver well I'll be following

72
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:39,530
this just fine

73
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:44,090
in the Steven Spielberg movie et why is

74
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:47,990
the alien Brown no reason in love story

75
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:50,120
why do the two characters fall madly in

76
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,580
love with each other no reason in the

77
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,800
pianist how come this guy has to hide

78
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,930
when he plays the piano so well at this

79
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:02,990
point the killer tire would be normal he

80
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:04,490
goes on explaining other random

81
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:05,900
questions from movies they have no

82
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,940
answers or maybe they do they're just

83
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,830
asked in really dumb ways in the

84
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,630
excellent Chainsaw Massacre by tobe

85
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:14,240
Hooper why don't we ever see the

86
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,430
characters go to the bathroom well I

87
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:18,289
can't account for the excellent Chainsaw

88
00:05:18,289 --> 00:05:19,910
Massacre before the Texas Chainsaw

89
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:21,410
Massacre I think it's because the

90
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:24,830
director wasn't a sicko I mean okay he

91
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,450
was but not you

92
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:28,909
kind of sicko the answer to all of these

93
00:05:28,909 --> 00:05:31,490
he suggests is the same no reason no

94
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:34,580
reason no reason absolutely no reason

95
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,229
why did the second oldest boy in malcolm

96
00:05:36,229 --> 00:05:38,300
in the middle' never have a family no

97
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,669
reason why did the moon never receive an

98
00:05:40,669 --> 00:05:42,919
email from his favorite ball of gas no

99
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:45,530
reason why did I get five more but I'll

100
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:48,289
stop you know as Goofy's this opening is

101
00:05:48,289 --> 00:05:50,569
I'm not gonna lie I really feel like he

102
00:05:50,569 --> 00:05:52,219
belongs at the beginning of a much more

103
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:54,560
appropriate movie witness fit a lot more

104
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,150
with something like the film you were

105
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:59,840
about to see today is in homage to the

106
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,370
no reason Alvin and the Chipmunks

107
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:05,840
wouldn't that weirdly make a lot more

108
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,509
sense so after putting the pretend and

109
00:06:08,509 --> 00:06:10,250
pretentious we see he was talking to a

110
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,020
group of people who are given binoculars

111
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:17,210
to watch the movie I guess it's already

112
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,030
born well I could guess what movie they

113
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:22,550
were watching as the credits roll and we

114
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,110
see birth finally had enough with Ernie

115
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:27,319
shit we finally see the title but more

116
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:29,330
importantly we see the directors credit

117
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:31,580
immediately after the title yeah he

118
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:32,750
wants you to know what movie you're

119
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,430
watching but he especially wants you to

120
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:43,009
know who to blame for it oh wait I've

121
00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:44,900
seen this it travels across the world

122
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,340
connects to other parts and puts the

123
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,349
Iron Giant back together again and they

124
00:06:48,349 --> 00:06:51,229
say split was a surprise sequel the tire

125
00:06:51,229 --> 00:06:54,440
seems to learn how to live suddenly and

126
00:06:54,440 --> 00:07:00,529
starts moving on its own now the tire

127
00:07:00,529 --> 00:07:02,330
continues to move around but is having

128
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:03,949
trouble keeping his balance thus moving

129
00:07:03,949 --> 00:07:05,240
around like he's being controlled by a

130
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,539
Wii Remote he comes across his first

131
00:07:08,539 --> 00:07:10,580
antagonist in the movie though a water

132
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:19,879
bottle murderer he then comes across a

133
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:25,490
scorpion it's gonna be a long movie

134
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:27,979
isn't it he then comes across a beer

135
00:07:27,979 --> 00:07:29,839
bottle which he can't seem to crush so

136
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:32,569
he uses his psychokinetic powers to blow

137
00:07:32,569 --> 00:07:35,820
it up yeah Tigers have those now

138
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,620
the TSA's minor trail of nuisance

139
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:41,440
continues the on lookers comment on what

140
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,970
they're seeing looks like he has

141
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,380
telepathic powers

142
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,150
you mean psychokinetic I don't care

143
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,980
about the right word I think the kid is

144
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:51,550
right psychokinetic powers excuse me but

145
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:53,200
you have to come in everything allowed

146
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:57,880
yeah so the tire continues to roll and

147
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:03,070
blows up a can this time Allen man I'm

148
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,270
not getting much from the tires

149
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:06,130
performance but he does still give more

150
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:09,010
emotion than Kristen Stewart whoo things

151
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:10,540
are getting really exciting because now

152
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:17,170
we have a musical score you clearly

153
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,940
missed a perfect opportunity to play a

154
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,250
more fitting song

155
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:25,460
[Music]

156
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:28,639
but it looks like he's tired it's not

157
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,500
worth as he rests and guess up the next

158
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:36,020
morning to continue his travels well

159
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,870
that happened meanwhile we see how this

160
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,550
film was financed with one of the guys

161
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:42,020
in charge stealing from one of the

162
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:45,160
viewers let's go

163
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:51,080
where is he straight ahead I just woke

164
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:55,370
up okay just tell me is this the cabin

165
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,380
in the woods universe is the tire just

166
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,330
one of the killer monsters that escaped

167
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,220
and the onlookers are just monitoring

168
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,200
the progress I'd have makes thoughts but

169
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,420
it's better than no thoughts

170
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:11,089
look the tire is drinking water you know

171
00:09:11,089 --> 00:09:12,770
it's the weirdest things that leave you

172
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:15,950
empty he finally comes across a living

173
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:21,980
mammal and tests his powers on it what

174
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,330
the hell

175
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:28,079
[Music]

176
00:09:28,079 --> 00:09:30,869
odd musical choice for an odd segment

177
00:09:30,869 --> 00:09:32,850
you know this movie is feeling less like

178
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:34,499
a horror film and more like an

179
00:09:34,499 --> 00:09:37,529
old-school Miller Lite commercial you

180
00:09:37,529 --> 00:09:40,889
worked hard had a long week and are

181
00:09:40,889 --> 00:09:43,379
celebrating your best friend blowing up

182
00:09:43,379 --> 00:09:47,129
a rabbit your best friend is a tire now

183
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:50,339
more than ever it's Miller time because

184
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:52,739
you work hard you play hard and that

185
00:09:52,739 --> 00:09:54,839
tire can turn your brain to spaghetti

186
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:56,420
sauce

187
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:59,249
Miller because if you're watching a

188
00:09:59,249 --> 00:10:01,259
killer tire you're probably drunk

189
00:10:01,259 --> 00:10:04,949
already a woman tries buying a

190
00:10:04,949 --> 00:10:06,809
convertible catching the tires attention

191
00:10:06,809 --> 00:10:14,249
I shall free you my manacled brethren it

192
00:10:14,249 --> 00:10:16,019
was run over by dr. gonzo and his

193

attorney we can't stop here this is

194
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:20,819
Firestone Country she continues to drive

195
00:10:20,819 --> 00:10:22,860
on as the tire comes across a guy at a

196
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,739
gas station what's the most you ever

197
00:10:25,739 --> 00:10:32,240
lost in a coin toss for endo oh my god I

198

Venkman put it you only have 75 more to

200
00:10:37,769 --> 00:10:42,959
go wait that tire matches the

201
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,269
description turn around he comes across

202
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:47,040
a hotel where a part of me is hoping

203
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,929
he'll reenact psycho as the onlookers

204
00:10:48,929 --> 00:10:50,490
continue to bring the annoyance of

205
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:51,869
watching a movie at a theater to the

206
00:10:51,869 --> 00:10:59,939
comfort of your home come on can't you

207
00:10:59,939 --> 00:11:01,410
take a little joke yeah oh there's

208
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,209
plenty of space go somewhere else if

209
00:11:03,209 --> 00:11:05,220
we're bothering you why do I feel like

210
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,019
these people were conned by Nathan

211
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:09,389
fielder I promised these people an

212
00:11:09,389 --> 00:11:11,339
interactive movie experience without

213
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:13,589
movie theater hassles but I had no

214
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:15,990
interactive movie to show so I kept them

215
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:18,119
at a safe distance and said it was about

216
00:11:18,119 --> 00:11:21,029
a killer tire I feel like I could only

217
00:11:21,029 --> 00:11:23,540
get away with this in California

218
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:26,160
fear not though it gets weirder

219
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:31,890
[Laughter]

220
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:35,550
working his or rollbacks it's a

221
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:36,870
personally hard to think of a joke about

222
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,850
a tire in a hotel room watching workout

223
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:41,580
videos meanwhile in the same hotel one

224
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,380
of the guys running the show is given a

225
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:47,610
call oh yes master I understand

226
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:51,360
perfectly I'm gonna do it tomorrow

227
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,620
morning without fail

228
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:56,250
so just to recap a guy in a hotel gets a

229
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,990
call from the master well he has a

230
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:01,020
turkey in his room well I for one think

231
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,060
it's about time a man knows Thanksgiving

232
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,339
wings of fate finally got aired God how

233
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:06,570
do I have an easier time coming up with

234
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:09,150
that joke than this one the next morning

235
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,589
after a few days without eating the

236
00:12:10,589 --> 00:12:12,390
onlookers are given the roasted carcass

237
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:19,860
of poultry Geist Christ it's like 3 p.m.

238
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,560
at the Old Country Buffet a staff member

239
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,480
seems to interrupt the tyres shower oh

240
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,279
they didn't tell me there was nudity in

241
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,050
this and big shock the tire does not

242
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:35,370
take this with Goodyear humor well she's

243
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:38,160
a maid so she can clean herself up the

244
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,110
tire then watches TV and checks out the

245
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:51,210
woman in the pool you think his

246
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:52,710
fascination with humans has seen a

247
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:55,320
strange to others like is this interest

248
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,200
made fun of by other tires hey you see

249
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,540

something you know it's true man

255
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:14,660
actually that's a common misconception

256
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,310
not all humans want to have sex with

257
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:19,140
humans some of us enjoy the creative

258

lifestyle designs an overall environment

259
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:25,120

260
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,110

somebody is after you I have no idea if

267
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:51,750
that's true I never even met you but

268
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,490
going by statistics of online crime

269
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:55,410
someone probably is there's a lot of

270
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:56,700
snoops and hackers out there and you

271
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,990
want to be careful and you want to be

272
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:59,340
smart that's why it's good to use

273
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,800
Express VPN like me you can feel safe

274
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,120
knowing that your information is

275
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,550
protected trust me you need a VPN

276
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,020
because without it your information can

277
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:09,600
be tracked by ISP cellular providers and

278
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,120
companies and hackers when you use a VPN

279
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,550
though your public IP is masked so even

280
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:16,080
the websites you visit won't be able to

281

identify you but also trust me when I

312
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,830
so the son of the owner of the hotel

313
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:37,020
says he saw a tire close one of the

314
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,730
doors the owner doesn't believe him and

315
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,500
commands he gets him a pizza and don't

316
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,390
forget the double toppings I like the

317
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:43,860
idea of making a kid's punishment your

318
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,320
reward he seems to come across this

319
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,850
totally pointless hitchhiker guy whoa

00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:52,710
well that's just rude clearly two people

321
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:54,140
can fit on that bike

322
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,990
say here's some double toppings

323
00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:00,210
double-talking stop doing my jokes the

324
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:07,260
tire meanwhile falls in the pool and the

325
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,000
onlookers seem to get sick from the food

326

they ate a poisonous Turkey was a trap

327
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:19,110
do I take it this is where a tire bursts

328
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:21,450
out of one of their stomachs don't worry

doing whatever it is you're doing for

332
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,770
whatever reason you're doing it ooh more

333

[Music]

335
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:44,380
did she just put orange juice on her

336
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:47,860
breakfast did anybody watch this film

337
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:50,170
while they were making it this tires

338
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:52,360
alive he'd locked okay you know what

339
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,010
I've heard enough rubbish for the day

340
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:56,770
all right now get that dirty tire out of

341
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:58,690
the pool or I'm gonna get really mad and

342
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:00,610
there's not nearly enough bird guts on

343
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:03,070
this pizza to make it edible meanwhile

344
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:04,510
the cop from the beginning of the movie

345
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:06,670
seems to ask the same WTF nests as

346
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:09,040
before don't you find it strange we

347
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,470
can't see the air around us don't you

348
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:12,670
think it's weird we're not giving

349
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:15,520
refunds to the viewers of this movie but

350
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,040
in a very odd turn yeah I know what I

351
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,380
said the cap says the poison has had

352
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,180
enough time to kill the spectators and

353
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,370
so everyone can stop everyone however

354
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:27,370
has no idea what he's talking about you

355
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:28,570
know I'll go home to your families now

356
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:31,090
you're out of your mind stop acting like

357
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:33,730
this is real life I'm telling you we're

358
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:35,860
done there's no one watching anymore

359
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:38,260
okay moviegoers have clearly left the

360
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,700
theater by now there's no point in

361
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,950
continuing he tries to prove it by

362
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,750
having somebody shoot him and it has no

363
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:52,270
effect it's not real you understand you

364
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:54,220
know if you just slap these two names on

365
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,510
the title this would have the biggest

366
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:57,940
cult following in the world the cop is

367
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,560
told though that one of the on lookers

368
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,420
is still alive because he didn't eat

369
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,310
which apparently means the film has to

370
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:05,470
keep going so he returns to question the

371
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:12,700
owner of the hotel okay either Deadpool

372
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,170
directed this movie or this is bad

373
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:16,060
lieutenant three I'm fine with either

374
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:19,300
just pick one or both it just give me

375
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:22,830
something the tire finds a mirror and

376
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:27,990
thinks back to the glory days

377
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:32,539
[Music]

378
00:18:32,539 --> 00:18:34,759
sometimes you just gotta ask yourself

379
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:37,350
how can I see my reflection with no lies

380
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:42,080
or what's this hole I feel in my body or

381
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:47,100
maybe um when should I retire what am I

382
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,830
supposed to do with this the boy sees

383
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,539
the tire and tries to figure out what's

384
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:52,289
going on

385
00:18:52,289 --> 00:19:00,499
do you talk me fumin boy hey answer me

386
00:19:00,499 --> 00:19:03,539
so how was your day son well I went to

387
00:19:03,539 --> 00:19:04,950
school asked a girl out and then

388
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,779
demanded to tire to talk to me took you

389
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:09,450
off those meds too soon so the cop gives

390
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:11,190
an idea for the suspect they're looking

391
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:13,940
for this is what our killer looks like

392
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:18,989
tire exactly I'm honestly shocked they

393
00:19:18,989 --> 00:19:20,489
didn't utilize their sketch artist for

394
00:19:20,489 --> 00:19:22,889
this one one of the cats though has a

395
00:19:22,889 --> 00:19:28,559
question is it black that didn't happen

396
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:32,100
it just felt good the cops find a tire

397
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,450
and stop right behind him

398
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:35,070
not getting out the car because I don't

399
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:39,029
know you want to know how I got these

400
00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:46,109
skid marks let me take a wild guess what

401
00:19:46,109 --> 00:19:53,029
happens I should have put that together

402
00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:55,499
one of the guys running things tries to

403
00:19:55,499 --> 00:19:57,450
poison the last unlocker but he refuses

404
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:01,580
to eat so the other guy does huh okay

405
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:07,159
stuff was supposed to be for you to eat

406
00:20:07,159 --> 00:20:09,389
Suicide Squad from Life of Brian was

407
00:20:09,389 --> 00:20:11,609
easier to take out than you he sees a

408
00:20:11,609 --> 00:20:13,289
burning tire pile and goes absolutely

409
00:20:13,289 --> 00:20:15,570
insane because over the next three days

410
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:17,279
he goes on a killing spree

411
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,989
he gives a ton of people the skander

412
00:20:18,989 --> 00:20:20,820
treatment and then watches I guess his

413
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,710
version of the Olympics one of the cops

414
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:24,419
finds the tire though as they let the

415
00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:26,039
guy in charge know who's apparently

416
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:29,659
playing chess you can't do that really

417
00:20:29,659 --> 00:20:32,580
well you can if you want but it's

418
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,500
against the rules

419
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,400
that's good to know that this film

420
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,630
graduated from the Freddy got fingered

421
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:39,760
school of advertising we know we don't

422
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,870
know what we're doing

423
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:42,910
get a load of this they're actually

424
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,770
attempting to Woody Woodpecker his ass

425
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:51,100
come on this scene makes no sense at all

426
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,810
so the onlooker comes around and says

427
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:54,700
the scene makes no sense about doing my

428
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,390
job

429
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:57,430
the onlooker suggests that just shooting

430
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:59,350
the tire will end the movie faster but

431
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:01,180
one of the cops brings up this good

432
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,160
point yeah but then we wouldn't be here

433
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:07,240
if you'd eaten a damn turkey that's true

434
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,420
enough you saw some Looney Tunes cartoon

435
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:13,780
written by Charlie Kaufman so in I have

436
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,760
to admit maybe my favorite anti

437
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,580
climactic death of any movie monster the

438
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,560
cop goes in saying he's just gonna blow

439
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,070
him away

440
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:23,200
shoots him off-screen and then throws

441
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,700
the carcass on the onlooker and by

442
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,170
that's like in Halloween if Michael

443
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:34,780
Myers went out like this he blowed up

444
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:37,300
exit 2 you're right I have to admire

445
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,550
what a slap in the face that is but

446
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:42,490
there's a twist in this ending I guess

447
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:44,800
it comes back as a tricycle and blows up

448
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:48,790
the onlooker hey baby

449
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:51,280
he's off to play invisible paperboy as

450
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,290
he's apparently gathered to tire army to

451
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:57,640
follow him and that seems to be it ok so

452
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,800
on the whole I can't act like it was oh

453
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:03,550
there's more like several minutes more

454
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:06,640
the final image I guess is the tricycle

455
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,560
and his dawn of the tread heading to

456
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,780
Hollywood the credits also show the cop

457
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,670
giving the intro speech again only this

458
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:14,920
time it's too literally nobody yet he

459
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,110
still doesn't word for word why do some

460
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:19,180
people love sausages and other people I

461
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:23,440
hate sausages no fucking reason call me

462
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,060
crazy but I didn't take a movie about a

463
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:27,340
killer tire with require returned the

464
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:29,950
King number endings come on don't waste

465
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:31,600
your time explaining that garbage so

466
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,070
let's go just a minute

467
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:37,090
let me finish da shoe and I was hoping

468
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:38,680
the final image would be Woody Harrelson

469
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,970
with flaming red hair saying there will

470
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:41,830
be carnage what the burning rubber did I

471
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:45,430
just watch on the one hand I guess I can

472
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:47,800
see why some people didn't like it

473
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,630
of questions about this world are raised

474
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:52,000
and are never answered and it even seems

475
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,160
like some of the jokes are set up and no

476
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,800
real punchlines are delivered but as the

477
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,540
film clearly states in the opening it

478
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:01,510
has no reason if anything it kind of

479
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:03,640
feels like a troll film it still us

480
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,160
laughs it still has gore it still has a

481
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,620
killer tire it just doesn't really care

482
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,750
much on the story's overviews is to have

483
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,670
much of one it's almost like the movie

484
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:14,350
focus is on the spectacle of such a

485
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:16,690
crazy idea rather than the crazy idea

486
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:18,730
itself but you could argue some horror

487
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,410
films already do without even

488
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:23,920
acknowledging it I kind of like that so

489
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,660
yeah if you look at this less like a

490
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:28,000
human centipede kind of dumb and more

491
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,580
like an artsy return to killer Tomatoes

492
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,650
kind of dumb I think you'll get a fun

493
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:34,960
experience it's weird it's silly it

494
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,210
makes little sense but it gave a tyre

495
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:38,950
killing people and a few surreal laughs

496
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,810
I guess what the kind of film it is

497
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:42,910
that's enough for me to say roll on in

498
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:48,010
and enjoy so that's it another nostalgia

499

to replace shrubs that we've lost due to

555
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,419
invasive species Friends of the forest

556
00:26:50,419 --> 00:26:52,700
preserves was established 20 years ago

559
00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:00,019
nonprofit grassroots group that saw a

560
00:27:00,019 --> 00:27:02,990
need to get more support for the first

561
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:04,370
reserves of Cook County and their

562
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:06,620
initiatives to help restore the health

563
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,419
of the forest preserves we offer

564
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:11,389
different ways of engaging people so if

565
00:27:11,389 --> 00:27:13,159
you're not ready to jump in and get your

566
00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:15,519
hands dirty and cut down evasive species

567
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:18,799
we also like to work with people to get

568
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:21,149
them out canoeing or hiking the

569
00:27:21,149 --> 00:27:23,159
kinds of educational events and all

570
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:24,779
supporting the forest reserves of Cook

571
00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:27,599
County's mission to engage people in the

572
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:29,999
enjoyment of natural areas in the area

573
00:27:29,999 --> 00:27:32,129
you always hear a lot of people say it's

574
00:27:32,129 --> 00:27:34,320
important to look after forest preserves

575
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,249
and the environment

576
00:27:35,249 --> 00:27:37,139
what's a reason to do this that people

577
00:27:37,139 --> 00:27:38,549
usually overlook or they don't think

578
00:27:38,549 --> 00:27:41,219
about the forest preserves in the city

579
00:27:41,219 --> 00:27:44,460
for habitat or home for a great

580
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,259
diversity of plants and animals that you

581
00:27:46,259 --> 00:27:48,089
wouldn't expect to find in a city

582
00:27:48,089 --> 00:27:49,889
environment what it does for your help

583
00:27:49,889 --> 00:27:51,690
to get in the forest is very important

584
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:54,419
but we know that there's 1,000 different

585
00:27:54,419 --> 00:27:57,330
species that we've had logged here that

586
00:27:57,330 --> 00:27:59,399
live here this is their home and they

587
00:27:59,399 --> 00:28:01,349
were here before us a lot of volunteers

588
00:28:01,349 --> 00:28:03,839
showed us today well over 50 people I

589
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:05,669
think showed up to this you sound like

590
00:28:05,669 --> 00:28:07,289
they kind of come from different groups

591
00:28:07,289 --> 00:28:09,059
and organizations and stuff like that

592
00:28:09,059 --> 00:28:10,889
what's the process there the various

593
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:13,139
organizations that are involved we all

594
00:28:13,139 --> 00:28:15,359
communicate regularly about what's going

595
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:17,129
on and try to work collaboratively we

596
00:28:17,129 --> 00:28:18,659
all have the same goal of trying to

597
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:20,940
conserve nature and engage people with

598
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:23,549
nature our main goal is we want people

599
00:28:23,549 --> 00:28:25,289

600
00:28:25,289 --> 00:28:27,440
recognize everybody is a volunteer and

601
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,359
volunteers want to have fun they don't

602
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:31,799
want to come out and feel like they work

603
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:34,499
