00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,250
awesome I've seen a little we're gonna

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:03,330
make an error I'm gonna make an airplane

3
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:23,480
video today so yeah this will be a

4
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,810
comprehensive review of Qatar Airways

5
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:30,870
business class experience

00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:00,140
now I do want to say that this video is

9
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,600
not an ad I wasn't paid or hired by this

10
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,570
company to make it but the flight

11
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:07,940
attendants didn't recognize me last time

12
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,440
I made one of these videos and they're

13
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,409
being extra nice to me so maybe take

14
00:01:12,409 --> 00:01:20,300
that into consideration let's begin by

15
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:41,539
having a look at the amenities kit now

16
00:01:41,539 --> 00:01:43,460
in addition the amenities kid I was also

17
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:46,399
given some pajamas I don't need for

18
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,289
jobless immersion wearing pajamas but I

19
00:01:48,289 --> 00:01:49,490
feel like because of this video I should

20
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:50,880
at least try them on

21
00:01:50,880 --> 00:02:06,770
[Music]

22
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:10,410
from a comfort perspective cannot attend

23
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:13,670
home run from a style perspective

24
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:15,380
I would find a little bit of color or

25
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:19,500
maybe like a big fat supreme logo but

26
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,209
I put my clothes back on

27
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:32,239
better this slides like 11 and a half

28
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,640
hours so the entertainment system is

29
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,959
very important

30
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:37,879
looks like about a 20 inch screen or

31
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:40,010
something remote here that sort of looks

32
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:42,109
like an iPhone they have these cameras

33
00:02:42,109 --> 00:02:44,659
on the outside of the plane and you can

34
00:02:44,659 --> 00:02:46,550
see what's around you

35
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:47,990
that's pretty cool it's like I put a

36
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:51,340
GoPro up there or something

37
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:54,220
impressive bar looking area behind me

38
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,739
here I don't know what this area is for

39
00:02:56,739 --> 00:02:58,959
I always find planes to be really

40
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,420
crowded I like having a little space

41
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,190
where I can stretch out maybe do a

42
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:05,590
little exercise get the blood flowing in

43
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,110
my legs again so

44
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:23,520
this feels good what are they our planes

45
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,390
have Chin's

46
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:27,440
I mean if they can put showers and

47
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,290
bars and lounges and airplanes we can't

48
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:36,380
to put a gym on it here business class

49
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:39,830
menu now one thing the lady explained to

50
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:42,020
me is that I can order whatever I want

51
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:44,180
whatever I want there is into mealtime

52
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:54,260
so a lot of options here can I have the

53
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,420
pancakes and smoked salmon yep perfect

54
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,280
how about a drink before that make some

55
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,020
smoothie eat some fresh orange juice

56
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:04,010
I'd like the smoothie please you know or

57
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,410

58
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:08,150

59
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:10,430

75
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:11,319

seat into a bed now I'm gonna go to

81
00:05:45,060 --> 00:06:03,389
sleep the bathroom's here they're just

82
00:06:03,389 --> 00:06:05,729
kind of like regular airplane bathrooms

83
00:06:05,729 --> 00:06:07,919
but the lighting in the mirror is sort

84
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,430
of a nice touch that and the day also

85
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:13,289
unlimited toothbrush and toothpaste it's

86
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:18,060
a nice gesture body mist kind of smells

87
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,370
like an airplane bathroom and like all

88
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:22,050
they're playing bathrooms it does serve

89
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:24,120
as a nice place to go when you need a

90
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:29,080
little alone time all right
