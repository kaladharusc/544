110
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:44,759
downloaded the app this is what it looks

111
00:05:39,749 --> 00:05:48,029
like in your do your butt go

112
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:50,369

113
00:05:48,029 --> 00:05:55,379
old pal old broken

114
00:05:50,369 --> 00:05:58,800
hello get this this powerup works back

115
00:05:55,379 --> 00:06:00,509
alright it's been about 40 minutes later

116
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,819
but i did get this thing to work

117
00:06:00,509 --> 00:06:04,469
I'm going to take off from you ready all

118
00:06:02,819 --> 00:06:08,579
right this is the tiny hand round taking

119
00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:11,219

120
00:06:08,579 --> 00:06:13,709
ok false alarm once again have to do

121
00:06:11,219 --> 00:06:15,419
some key drones is not the hardware now

122
00:06:13,709 --> 00:06:18,059
this thing physically looks like what

123
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:19,860
matters is the software like what powers

124
00:06:18,059 --> 00:06:21,959
it what controls it when you're counting

125
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:24,389
on software to operate this like flying

126
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:25,800
camera there's like so many variables

127
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:27,659
and you need to be accounting software

128
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,029
and like I invited my friend over I just

129
00:06:27,659 --> 00:06:31,409
make him sit there and watch me not fly

130
00:06:30,029 --> 00:06:33,869
my grill it literally says right now

131
00:06:31,409 --> 00:06:35,920
that your drone gently

132
00:06:33,869 --> 00:06:41,320
how could you put home

133
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:45,729
but ok well here we are right in to

134
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:55,820

135
00:06:45,729 --> 00:06:58,970

136
00:06:55,820 --> 00:07:01,730
the little guys airborne that there are

137
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:04,160
no controls on the screen company will

138
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:07,640
continue to eventual took down your

139
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:10,220
template wouldn't do my job okay there

140
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:11,870
it is i have a role some video on this

141
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:18,920
thing

142
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:24,350
ok you have a student group can you be

143
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:25,820
so important that I see almost appear at

144
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:26,720
least landed safely if you take it

145
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,730
outside

146
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,050
yeah certainly wait let me just read the

147
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:32,480
manual first again

148
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:33,890
ok I take back most of the bad stuff

149
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,970
that I said about this drone that was

150
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:38,510
pretty fun

151
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:41,690
ok forward til 0x0 problems left till

152
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:45,410
but he may go up and down the cootie

153
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:46,940
because my office in front of a camera

154
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:48,560
store there's a light in the window

155
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:52,070
which makes us look professionally live

156
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:59,160
resetting the drone it did not work the

157
00:07:52,070 --> 00:08:00,990
way it's going it going here

158
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,700
girls what are you thinking a tiny

159
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:03,510
flying thing and it doesn't have a

160
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,160
camera

161
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:09,630
well sort of this is what it looks like

162
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:13,200
you kind of all that is a massive

163
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:16,460
massive overstatement

164
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:25,639
okay bring it back

165
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:28,130
darn the Walkabout got 100 lb you need

166
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:31,040
to show was in some Tim that cold and

167
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:33,410
the wind

168
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:35,840
I did lose a drone and that's an

169
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:37,940
irresponsible thing to do it was a toy

170
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:40,100
drone I probably should not have been

171
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:42,500
flying it outside even setting fly

172
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:47,540
outside but you know I was laughing and

173
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:50,870
that was fun like kinda stupid having

174
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:53,150
some late night on raw vegan food just

175
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:56,030
farted

176
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:57,620
I'm finding it helped the amount i

177
00:08:56,030 --> 00:09:02,390
remember telling you one day case you

178
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:07,130
would be vegan did not know it I know it

179
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:08,350
Francine whatever the music having a

180
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:10,110
dance party

181
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:12,899
cheese

182
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:18,670
that's the cheese I thought she pooped

183
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:25,270
her parents your pregnancy

184
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:28,450
very good

185
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:32,770
the conclusive outcome on this review is

186
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:34,390
a determinate finger I'm really good at

187
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:37,120
flying drones I've gotten so good at it

188
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:40,600
i just think that I wasn't applying that

189
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,460
row sure it will ever see it again

190
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:48,090
yes we gotta get back this

191
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:48,090
responsibility
