like it cheap but I don't know anything

81
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:58,329
about computers um honestly as of lately

82
00:03:58,329 --> 00:04:00,620
I'm not too intelligent when it comes to

83
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,880
you know PC building anymore just

84
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,190
because the everything advances so fast

85
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:06,200
and the technology is just so much more

86
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,780
advanced but for my knowledge you know

87
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,350
because I just recently built a new PC

88
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:13,580
without going through a company it's

89
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,530
probably cheaper to go through

90
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:18,079
company because people's oh thank you

Oh Dark Soul yeah mixer is not a good

133
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,760
place to stream when you're set to 18

134
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,650
plus you get lower on the pages compared

135
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:00,850
to family friendly or tomb raider

136
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:02,020
streams and I'm one of those people who

137
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:06,250
can't play under 18 plus I agree yeah I

138
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,660
mean I feel like if you're if you're

139
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,920
streaming on mixer you're probably

140
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,380
streaming on the platform that all of

141
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,270
these Minecrafters were originally paid

142
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:16,000
to stream on so of course the audience

143
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,890
in the main demographic they're gonna go

144
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:20,350
for is pretty young

145
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:23,680
I mean twitch and YouTube streaming has

146
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,090
gotten popular through games like

147
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:27,070
fortnight and pub G and Grand Theft Auto

148
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:31,720
and and you know mixer got popular off

149
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:35,980
of roblox and minecraft so roblox you

150
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,720

151
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,340
the website I guess you're streaming on

152
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:41,260

153
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,270
and who established and created and

154
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:47,020

176
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,660
issue let's see like skydive as much as

177
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:03,510
you want us actually got here faster

178
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:08,530
than anyone land and dusty yeah I'm in

179
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:11,740
dusty and I mean like any any hostels I

180
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,420
don't think so I didn't see anybody

181
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:17,830
around me which is perfectly feels like

182
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:21,090
the video to be the first really

183
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:25,470
congratulations baked bean no one cares

184
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:28,000
your one dislikes not going to affect my

185
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,140
channel in the slightest

186
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:33,130
oh no and in fact you're actually

187
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:35,110
helping my channel too with with that

188
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:37,260
one dislike I have to deactivate now

189
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:40,150
being here actually is helpful because

190
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,200
you're giving them what's called watch

191
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,820
time and watch time is actually more

192
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:45,550
important than likes or dislikes so you

193
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:47,890
can come to my my stream and then

194
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:50,290
dislike my my stream but then when you

195
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,460
do that you're actually pushing me up

196
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,750
into the algorithm is because you're

197
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,490
still on my stream to dislike it which

198
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:56,410
boosts my viewer retention you did it

199
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:59,820
mean nice try you failed but got him

200

the thermal is still in the game yeah

228
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,560
it's probably it's already a rare drop

229
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,840
so it's probably still around they

230
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,970
didn't say they were getting rid of it

231
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:42,500
the only reason you're going for Logan

00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,760
he was the first legit YouTube merch

291
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,740
businessman yeah that's true

that's pretty cool dude let's play

295
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,779
better than basket miro

296
00:14:49,779 --> 00:14:52,480
hi Adam do you remember me sorry for not

297
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,050
beating there yeah I mean I do what's up

298
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:58,089
Mira it's been a while since you've been

299
00:14:58,089 --> 00:15:02,980
back to this team sabe

300
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:07,510
guys we're doing so good emerald

301
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:09,980
Nightingale I'm not gonna lie I never

302
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,720
really listened Adams music just because

303
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,130
I'm not too into the style he was making

304
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:14,990
so that's actually super fair criticism

305
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:17,510
now the reason the reason why I want to

306
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,860
I want to go ahead and say that is

307
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,930
because you know for these for these

308
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:22,580
people who have been watching the post

309
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,650
things on YouTube you know I came at I

310
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:27,560
came at ksi with that that meme dis

311
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,610
track because it was in the middle of

312
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:29,960
all of his Cybermen drama which he

313
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:33,410
proved to be fake so of course of course

314
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:35,180
you know vehicle yeah I know I see him

315
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:38,150
of course there's a youtuber myself they

316
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:39,620
were all they're all making these like

317
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,420
this track memes so I was like alright

318
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,550
well it's all fake and I'm sure he won't

319
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:45,500
mind if I come in and me met him I'd

320
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,850
probably be great for whatever he's

321
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:49,430
trying to do so you're right it's all

322
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:53,210
fake anyway so on did that and then we

323
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:57,110
we wind up with ksi is literally faking

324
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:59,120
all his disconnect and then at one knock

325
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,990
down after I challenge him my diss track

326
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:04,670
was probably just better than anything

327
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,590
all of his friends made which were all

328
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:10,190
fake and then he decided it was it was

329
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:12,650
chill to bring my family into shit

330
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:14,930
because she's fucking losing oh shit and

331
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:17,990
that's totally dick move like just as a

332
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:22,670
human being here we go

333
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:27,220
tail down yeah I got you yeah yeah damn

334
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:37,940
close come on one bandage video output

335
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:40,850
low and then also tell these people who

336
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:45,770
keep going like that I got like fucking

337
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:48,950
owned or some shape it's I I do I guess

338
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:51,680
I just don't necessarily agree because

339
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,240
at the end of the day my net nobody

340
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,400
channel was sitting here with like

341
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,130
20,000 views a song and now I drop one

342
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:01,580
and it gets like 500 so it's like that's

343
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,090
a win

344
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:04,460
clear clearly yeah clearly I pulled like

345
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,780
people who actually want to listen to

346
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:08,600
real music from this this guy who slurs

347
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,199
his words every three seconds

348
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,030
it's like it's like if it's like trying

349
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:16,490
to compete with like Michael Jackson

350
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:20,150
versus ice JJ fish and like I don't mean

351
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:22,100
to compare and you know puff myself up

352
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:25,280
but I also know when someone's good and

353
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:31,580
when someone's being fed shit so and I I

354
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,980
think ksi needs work I think that the

355
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:36,230
longer that he actually sits here in and

356
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:38,980
treats it is his music career like a

357
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:42,190
expendable hobby that he can just throw

358
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:44,540
sad because I feel like he just threw

359
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,920
away his music career because it didn't

360
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,390
work out that well for him now he's

361
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:49,550
doing this stupid boxing thing yeah I

362
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:50,750
think he I think he could have actually

363
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,150
genuinely bit like a pretty good and I

364
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:57,350
think if he had kept on you know and was

365
00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:00,110
what's more focused on I don't know

366
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:01,700
something positive like a positive

367
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,770
message with his music versus like

368
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:06,590
knocking on depression and and like

369
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:09,350
calling his friends fat mmm doing a

370
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:11,360
bunch of stupid old shit like that and

371
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,050
they're just like what are we getting

372
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:16,460
like mm fucking 12 2010 Oh Sammy manages

373
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:21,200
by the way I have bandages isn't

374
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,480

375
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,120
his fortnight gameplay I mean there's a

376
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,440
lot of rumors going around that he's

377
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,179
faking his fortnight gameplay I can't

378
00:18:29,179 --> 00:18:33,990
100% confirm or deny because I don't

379

like what he do

541
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:14,100
he's streaming what do you guys think of

542
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:18,929
a song it's Watson who's Watson Watson

543
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:20,640
he's the whole reason I got good at

544
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,850
music it's like I he basically took me

545
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:27,030
under his wing as like a it's like a

546
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:27,809
protege

547
00:27:27,809 --> 00:27:33,780
so you're Watson no but uh I will 100%

548
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:36,840
say that like a lot of my um a lot of

549
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,720
everything I know nowadays I could say

550
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:42,210
that Watson definitely teaches me a lot

551
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:43,890
of it he teach me he taught me how to

552
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:46,260
like it taught me how to be my myself

553
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,120
when I came to music tell me how to just

554
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,610
go for it you know and that's that's

555
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:51,570
superburger

556
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:53,549
so you're saying Watson is not an entity

557
00:27:53,549 --> 00:27:58,130
or a being he's a mobile my black friend

558
00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:06,540
yep so he's dark so gaming but on the

559
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,040
mixer topic the only reason I haven't

560
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,419
streamed to multiple platforms is that

561
00:28:09,419 --> 00:28:11,070
I'd have to set up a lot more on stream

562
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,540
labs and the other websites on the OBS

563
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:15,440
makes things about three times harder ah

564
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,770
I can see how that would happen that is

565
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:21,600
complicated but might be worth in the

566
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,559

614
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,809
if you're dropping so much damn money on

615
00:30:41,809 --> 00:30:43,760

616

bands on a PC is crazy yeah it's

617
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:49,429
probably custom I mean like a custom

618
00:30:49,429 --> 00:30:50,450
water cooling or is it like an

619
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:52,520
all-in-one cuz I'd be really weird if it

620
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,380
was the custom they fucked it up yeah

621
00:30:54,380 --> 00:31:01,460
cuz that's so easy to push oh right I

622
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,140
was saying this earlier but I had a lot

623
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:05,779
of people whom they they saw me come

624
00:31:05,779 --> 00:31:07,669
into the whole diss track thing through

625
00:31:07,669 --> 00:31:09,710
the through the chaos I'd this track and

626
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:11,000
I started listening to my music and a

627
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,070
couple of them were like wow I can never

628
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:15,110
I just feel like you can never fucking

629
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:17,059
figure out which song I like or I don't

630
00:31:17,059 --> 00:31:18,440
like your song all this music is

631
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,940
different it's super weird it's kind of

632
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:21,530
funny because for the past year I feel

633
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:22,970
like I've been just developing my sound

634
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:24,409
and I've just been dropping what would I

635
00:31:24,409 --> 00:31:25,929
would consider

636
00:31:25,929 --> 00:31:28,179
just tracks on the fly you know like I'm

637
00:31:28,179 --> 00:31:30,759
not sitting here in my kitchen and like

638
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:33,610
I'm out I wasn't necessarily working on

639
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:35,710
like a project right but me and shad

640
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:36,639

641
00:31:36,639 --> 00:31:38,559
together so I'm hope I'm hoping that

642
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:41,049
when we release this it'll blow a lot of

643
00:31:41,049 --> 00:31:42,279
people's minds you guys are way back

650
00:31:57,789 --> 00:32:00,070

and the thumbnail yeah he switched the

799

00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:00,840
good meeting or something like I would

804
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:03,210
have laughed but instead he just decided

805
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:04,590
to act like a douche about it and then

806
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:06,450
when he was caught he was basically like

807
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:09,030

930
00:46:28,690 --> 00:46:33,790
suit on I'm gonna die now okay did you

931
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:36,670
see that eight did you see that he shot

932
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:40,270
him right in the fucking face in before

933
00:46:40,270 --> 00:46:45,760
fortnight hackings what is going on with

934
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,200
these pumps right now did they nerf

935
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,660
pumps they changed the way shotguns

936
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:52,030
shoot now oh yeah I noticed that I was

937
00:46:52,030 --> 00:46:53,770
hitting shit with the shotgun see you

938
00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:55,240
know the reason why most aiming is

939
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:56,500
really bad in this game is because they

940
00:46:56,500 --> 00:47:00,190
add they have a thing called bloom yeah

941
00:47:00,190 --> 00:47:02,500
so all the shots are completely random

942
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:05,050
they're not like a set recoil pattern

943
00:47:05,050 --> 00:47:07,890
like most games yeah sorry I'm echoing

944
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:10,450

probably the sixth grade yes it's great

1065
00:53:29,990 --> 00:53:37,670
when I started straightening my hair in

1066
00:53:37,670 --> 00:53:40,400
New York and then all my career when I I

1067

hair what by straining me so that's why

1071

I eventually needed to cut it just

1072
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:56,810
really short

1073
00:53:56,810 --> 00:53:58,820
