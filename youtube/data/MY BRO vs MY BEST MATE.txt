3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:08,580
position my bro versus one of my best

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,889
mates okay for those of you that don't

5
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:13,139
fully understand what's going on let me

6
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:15,660
give you a quick recap so it all started

7
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,050
from a sadness on the video I saw me and

8
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,600
everyone else we were just doing a quick

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,019
Family Fortunes video and this happened

10
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:27,890
a dead YouTube channel

11
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:47,219
edgy death as in not doing well Oh

12
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:51,719
survey says as soon as happened I kinda

13
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:55,440
knew that my bro wouldn't take that

14
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,780
nicely he kind of takes everything to

15
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:58,079
heart

16
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,149
you kind of overreact over everything so

17
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:02,780
it's just as we all expected he replied

18
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,760

82
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,730
let's bet 10 K obviously he lost but the

83
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:14,830

I want to 50% out of 100 percent I would

86
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:21,560
get from the boxing fight and I was like

87
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,220
no if you win I'll give you 40% and if

88
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:28,880
you lose you get 25% so I tried to give

89
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,890
and give him an incentive to win because

90
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:32,840
at this time he wasn't training as hard

91
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,540
as he could have and yeah well I mean we

92
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,970
all saw the fight he lost it so he got

93
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:41,300
