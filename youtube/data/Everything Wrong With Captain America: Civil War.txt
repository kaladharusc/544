[Music]

2
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:10,080
look you can show me an icy tundra if

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,370
you want but you've got to tell me what

4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:12,360
year it is ah

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,309
1991 why did I have to wipe Bucky at

6
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:16,199
this point wasn't he wiped before he

7
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:17,850
went into the crown sleep also this book

8
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,260
that supposedly controls the Winter

9
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,640
Soldier is introduced here but wasn't

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,350
referenced in Winter Soldier at all and

11
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,029
Zemo found it buried in some assholes

12
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:25,500
wall in Cleveland so how did they

13
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,180
control him in the last movie 20 seconds

14
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,769
of interrupting Marvel logo why the hell

15
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:30,150
would you rob police stations another

16
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:31,710
maybe some extra weapons sitting around

17
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:32,969
in the evidence room but there's no way

18
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:34,170
there would be enough there to make it

19
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,940
worth it for super villainy also this

20
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,290
article is the newspaper version of

21
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:38,760
clickbait as the article underneath it

22
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,140
is some sort of vague repetitious

23
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,520
nonsense that's probably trying to sell

24
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,320
viagra the other barrier on the left was

25
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,460
still standing and the truck was

26
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,690
blocking the whole right lane but

27
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:47,100
seconds later these assholes somehow

28
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,360
drive straight through wide open

29
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,160
entrance make crossbones he'll be you're

30
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,510
expendable villain plot device for the

31
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:52,320
next seven minutes

32
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,879
I know cap is impervious to a lot of

33
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:55,350
stuff but this gas is apparently pretty

34
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,000
lethal if it didn't capacitated this

35
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,980
dude immediately in caps unaffected he's

36
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,539
also been developing an immunity to I

37
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:04,379
okay in powder that's badass but tell me

38
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:05,580
what kind of bullshit is this

39
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,320
how can a shield of this power bounce

40
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,760
off floors and walls instead of just

41
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,350
destroying them and how did cap the gear

42
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:11,610
out the geometry of that shop

43
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:16,590
I also agree this is cool but why didn't

44
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:17,670
he do something like this the very

45
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,590
beginning Scarlet Witch helpfully throws

46
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,210
the gas into the atmosphere where it can

47
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,280
affect many more people in Lagos Black

48
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,509
Widow canned through one of those taser

49
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:26,100
things faster than this asshole can fire

50
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,619
a bullet ah welcome back 500 edits per

51
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:30,240
fight editing how Scarlett's stunt

52
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,979
double doing great just great look I

53
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:33,360
have other people to talk to but we'll

54
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,860
have a beer later alright I know she's a

55
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,930
badass but come on Black Widow just took

56
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,880
out eight heavily armed bad guys did the

57
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,960
Avengers not have a drug testing

58
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,090
protocol in place

59
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:43,890
where these assholes doing this entire

60
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:45,420
fight our comrades are getting their

61
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,950
asses kicked but we see no reason to

62
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,270
step out of this tank and fire bullets

63
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,890
at anybody do to our conscientious

64
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:53,670
objections she survives this oh good

65
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,229
another villain who thinks he can win a

66
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:56,670
punching contest with Captain America

67
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,219
after cap inevitably wins I'm sure no

68
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:00,479
one else will try this during the rest

69
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:01,079
of this movie

70
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:04,469
his name is Red Wing he's cute better

71
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:06,060
huh huh huh while you guys are cracking

72
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,140
wise has anyone checked on cap Olsen ex

73
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:11,849
machina welcome to comic book movie

74
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:13,620
number two of the year where heroes get

75
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,150
all guilty about the innocent lives they

76
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,680
kill during their missions it only took

77
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,840
13 movies be nice tear he's been

78
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,030
studying abroad really which broad Roger

79
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,489
starkly less than zero CGI Robert Downey

80
00:02:23,489 --> 00:02:25,319
jr. plus six hundred eleven million

81
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:27,150
dollars for my little therapeutic

82
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,739
experiment it appears that Tony is

83
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:30,840
merely being honored at MIT but he

84
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,370
decided to show the audience his virtual

85
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:34,110
reality memory which just so happens to

86
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,129
be important to the plot of this movie

87
00:02:35,129 --> 00:02:36,750
also he could tell these students he

88
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,250
funded their dumb projects is this a

89
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,360
hologram teleprompter

90
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,799
do you mean all the students saw what

91
00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:42,329
Tony was going to say albeit backwards

92
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:44,400
before he had a chance to say it I am so

93
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,170
sorry about the teleprompter I didn't

94
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:47,609
know miss Potts had canceled even if

95
00:02:47,609 --> 00:02:48,959
they didn't know about pepper canceling

96
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,459
before the talk began it was the last

97
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:52,019
line of the speech so they totally had

98
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:53,579
time to remove the unnecessary reference

99
00:02:53,579 --> 00:02:55,500
to a character we won't be seen be donut

100
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,109
I'm right where I want to be alfre

101
00:02:58,109 --> 00:02:59,609
woodard somehow knew tony would be not

102
00:02:59,609 --> 00:03:01,260
only exiting the stage this way but also

103
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,060
that he would bypass the bathroom and go

104
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,590
straight for the elevator míriam waste

105
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,180
State Department tax dollars by leaving

106
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,069
work driving to MIT and briefly with

107
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:10,650
Ironman victory at the expense of the

108
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:13,799
innocent is no victory at all damn it

109
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:15,419
sure got all Don of Justice he up in

110
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:18,269
here moving very specific unfortunately

111
00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:20,849
her accent is not I'm lost and Bucky all

112
00:03:20,849 --> 00:03:23,130
said now is a 16 year old kid again in

113
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:24,569
Brooklyn you could say that the word

114
00:03:24,569 --> 00:03:26,010
Bucky is almost Captain America's

115
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:28,590
kryptonite or Martha

116
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:31,390
please we talked about this

117
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:34,060
beeping vision no vision Tom Captain

118
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,890
Rogers wished to know when mr. stock was

119
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:37,870
arrived so I came to Wanda's room right

120
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:38,260
away

121
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,500
world owes the Avengers unpayable debt

122
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,629
that's it he should stop right there

123
00:03:43,629 --> 00:03:44,920
there is nothing else that needs to be

124
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,170
discussed not sokovia or Lagos or even

125
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:48,430
Manhattan they saved the universe

126
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,540
multiple times

127
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,790
how about dangerous as in Batman V

128
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:53,349
Superman the government comes in and

129
00:03:53,349 --> 00:03:54,519
explains that they're scared of

130
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:55,810
superheroes now because of what they can

131
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:57,430
do and what's the difference between the

132
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:59,379
two movies again once brighter and tells

133
00:03:59,379 --> 00:04:01,030
a few more jokes and doesn't suck I mean

134
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,470
what's the difference what would you

135
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:05,250
call a group of US based enhanced

136
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,780
individuals who routinely ignore

137
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,060
sovereign borders that seem unconcerned

138
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,950
about what they leave behind

139
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:14,440
um the Justice League Ryan Lochte also

140
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,060
the entire last part of the battle of

141
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,739
sokovia was the Avengers saving as many

142
00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:19,329
individuals as possible discount

143
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:21,070
Quicksilver even died for a kid does

144
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,810
nobody want to mention this tell me

145
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,789
captain do you know where a Thor and

146
00:04:24,789 --> 00:04:26,830
Banner are right now of course he

147
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,240
doesn't if he did this would be an

148
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,190
Avengers movie and it's totally not an

149
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,960
Avengers movie three days from now the

150
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,660
UN meets in Vienna to ratify the Accords

151
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,220
the sokovia accords were approved by a

152
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,630
hundred and seventeen countries and

153
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,010
somehow the avengers didn't get the news

154
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:40,810
until three days before the ratification

155
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:43,210
and if we come into a decision you don't

156
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:45,820
like then you retire apparently Ross

157
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,410
thinks he's Santos considering he makes

158
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:48,669
this statement as if he would have any

159
00:04:48,669 --> 00:04:50,710
say in the matter also let's say the UN

160
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,000
decides they need the Avengers for

161
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,200
something how does that prevent the

162
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,220
Avengers from accidentally killing

163
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,960
people hey guys we need you but let's

164
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,580
try extra hard not to kill innocent

165
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:58,210
people this stunt

166
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:59,560
once again I'm happy they didn't have to

167
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,699
put the state or country that

168
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:02,380
Cleveland's in but do they have to use

169
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,599
the largest freaking font ever the cops

170
00:05:04,599 --> 00:05:06,550
this guy who's definitely afraid of

171
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:08,169
anybody who might come by wanting to

172
00:05:08,169 --> 00:05:09,520
steal the information he has willingly

173
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,440
opens his door to this guy without a gun

174
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,970
and a story that smells of immediate and

175
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:14,830
total bull I mean can you just say that

176
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,750
wasn't his car outside zimos power must

177
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,520
be x-ray vision considering he found the

178
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:23,440
book in an innocuous wall but the box of

179
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,000
water stops before his nose and mouth

180
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,530
and the water is already spilling out of

181
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:28,750
the box so zimos plan is to wash that

182
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,340
evil right out of his hair since mrs.

183
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,260
doc announced himself as AI man the

184
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,900
number of known enhanced persons has

185
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,030
grown exponentially during the same

186
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:38,860
period the number of potentially

187
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,719
world-ending events has risen at a

188
00:05:40,719 --> 00:05:41,860
commensurate

189
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,090
but thinking about the conflicts that

190
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:44,680
arose in the Marvel Cinematic Universe

191
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,300
since Tony announced he was Iron Man

192
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,949
Thor came to earth because of some bulk

193
00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:49,360
that happened on his own planet which

194
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,919
brought Loki and some dickhead robot

195
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:52,300
monster thing with it the Avengers movie

196
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,289
happened because of the stuff that

197
00:05:53,289 --> 00:05:55,240
happened in Thor Iron Man 2 is because

198
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,680
some dude wanted revenge against Tony

199
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,090
Thor to the dark world

200
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:59,770
something-something realms something

201
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:02,080
something dark elves Iron Man 3 happens

202
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,430
because another asshole wanted revenge

203
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,060
on Tony

204
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,740
the Winter Soldier happens because Hydra

205
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,270
is still around and Avengers 2 happens

206
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,860
because Tony created Ultron and that's

207
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,990
the end of that argument ova site is not

208
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:12,430
an idea that can be dismissed out of

209
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,199
hand ok but you just mentioned that the

210
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:15,580
existence of the Avengers invites

211
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,409
conflict how would that change with any

212
00:06:17,409 --> 00:06:19,120
administrative oversight Tony takes out

213
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,349
his phone and lays it in a fruit basket

214
00:06:20,349 --> 00:06:22,060
so that it can play hologram footage of

215
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,219
somebody's dead son gee it sounds kind

216
00:06:24,219 --> 00:06:25,270
of stupid when you say it out loud

217
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:27,159
aren't you the same woman who told the

218
00:06:27,159 --> 00:06:28,840
government to kiss her ass a few years

219
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,150
ago I'm just reading the terrain first

220
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:32,409
off Falcon would be amazing at

221
00:06:32,409 --> 00:06:34,360
cinemasins second off this bee or so off

222
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,189
character from Romanoff that I can't

223
00:06:36,189 --> 00:06:38,379
stop saying on I just knew her as an

224
00:06:38,379 --> 00:06:38,830
Peggy

225
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,840
it was a lot to live up to which is why

226
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,490
I never told anyone we were related

227
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:44,259
until now when the plot demands it and

228
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:45,669
I'm the featured speaker for her eulogy

229
00:06:45,669 --> 00:06:47,710
I know what are you doing here I didn't

230
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,750
want you to be along also I needed to

231
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,159
give you in the audience some exposition

232
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:52,659
and set the stage for the next scene I

233
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:54,279
knew you'd be here well after the

234
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:55,539
funeral and didn't bother to call or

235
00:06:55,539 --> 00:06:56,050
text first

236
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:58,089
wait they just found this bomb after the

237
00:06:58,089 --> 00:06:59,229
van had been parked right across the

238
00:06:59,229 --> 00:07:00,610
street from the meeting don't they check

239
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:01,990
that stuff before it gets to a horribly

240
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:03,909
strategic location he heroically jumps

241
00:07:03,909 --> 00:07:05,289
into the blast but is one of the only

242
00:07:05,289 --> 00:07:07,270
ones to survive this also who the

243
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,409
thought there would be a cataclysmic

244
00:07:08,409 --> 00:07:09,580
event during a gathering of world

245
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,379
leaders well if you hadn't seen homeland

246
00:07:11,379 --> 00:07:13,210
or does it need a survivor White House

247
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:15,400
down Independence Day Batman V Superman

248
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,509
or King Ralph this burgeoning

249
00:07:16,509 --> 00:07:18,339
relationship when you boil it down it's

250
00:07:18,339 --> 00:07:22,169
like Edward and Bella and Twilight Steve

251
00:07:22,169 --> 00:07:24,279
something you got to see you need to

252
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:25,419
come take a look at this cock-blocking

253
00:07:25,419 --> 00:07:28,900
cliche is 12 Undead 12 sure there's

254
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,069
probably gonna be more deaths later

255
00:07:30,069 --> 00:07:31,330
because that's the way the news works

256
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:32,919
but that explosion blew up a whole city

257
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:34,629
block and I can't believe that when he

258
00:07:34,629 --> 00:07:36,039
told everyone to get down that somehow

259
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:38,759
saved a lot of people mister its noise

260
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:41,139
thank God Sharon is Peggy's niece and

261
00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:42,400
was here for the funeral and is in love

262
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,719
with Steve Rogers so she can pass him

263
00:07:43,719 --> 00:07:45,610
important information illegally also why

264
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:46,930
do they think he could set off a bomb in

265
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:48,580
Vienna and make it back home in time to

266
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,380
arrest him that's a 12-hour Drive and

267
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,880
everything else requires a well-known

268
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,589
fugitive to go through airports or train

269
00:07:53,589 --> 00:07:54,849
stations which I'm not buying

270
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:55,210
unless

271
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:56,919
the Buckey identity if Becky's face is

272
00:07:56,919 --> 00:07:58,360
so well known that the news can casually

273
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,680
refer to him as the Winter Soldier

274
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,539
everyone knows what that means then how

275
00:08:01,539 --> 00:08:02,560
can he walk around without getting a

276
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,120
disguise and without getting noticed if

277
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,259
he's been hiding out here for the last

278
00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:07,000
couple here is more like Bucky rest am i

279
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,590
right does anyone want to shoot this guy

280
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:10,240
anywhere but is obviously bulletproof

281
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,259
and that's right it took four cups for

282
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:15,639
that one badass takedown

283
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:17,590
welcome to action movies in 2016 the

284
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:19,060
shooter from the UN task force just

285
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,889
fires with impunity without seeing

286
00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:22,449
there's another person there it's almost

287
00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:23,380
like they'll accept some collateral

288
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,759
damage for the good of the overall

289
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:26,110
mission luckily everyone can just

290
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:27,550
blindly jump down onto this busy road

291
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:31,419
without getting plowed into however

292
00:08:31,419 --> 00:08:33,250
implausible this sequence is I'm gonna

293
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,810
remove a sin for black panther being a

294
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:36,849
badass or machine took so long to get

295
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,080
here they consider replacing him with

296
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,909
Terrence Howard we now take you division

297
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:41,680
and Scarlet Witch the most powerful

298
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,390
characters in this movie flirting over

299
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,880
some goddamn soup and what do you want

300
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:50,230
well people to see you aside so is this

301
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,940
getting serious if so what's that

302
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,709
bedroom gonna look like hang on Google

303
00:08:53,709 --> 00:08:55,839
Maps tells me it's 18 King hours from

304
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,640
Bucharest of Berlin there isn't a task

305
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,920
force office in Bucharest or Belgrade or

306
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,560
anywhere nearby even Vienna's closer so

307
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,390
you like cats you're just now asking

308
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:06,490
this even if they flew here this banter

309
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:08,250
should have happened long ago your suit

310
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:11,470
vibranium the Black Panther has been the

311
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:13,990
protector of Wakanda for generations a

312
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:17,350
mantle passed from warrior to warrior if

313
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:18,700
you ask about the Panther suit you'll

314
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,500
get some heavy what cannon exposition

315
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,480
hello everyone I'm Everett Kay Ross from

316
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,310
the black panther series of comics I am

317
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:25,930
not to be confused with Thaddeus Ross

318
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,670
the guy from Incredible Hulk who also

319
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:28,899
makes an appearance in this movie I

320
00:09:28,899 --> 00:09:30,310
would the task force released this

321
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:31,990
filler to begin much seems like a normal

322
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:33,190
thing that happens every time something

323
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:34,510
like this happens but Steve is

324
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:36,310
suspicious of it all so you had an

325
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:37,930
18-hour trip in a van to think about

326
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:39,130
this I can understand you being

327
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:40,510
suspicious but isn't that your nature

328
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:41,860
since Winter Soldier aren't you like

329
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,149
Sherlock Holmes now even though that's

330
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:46,179
Tony's job Jelani

331
00:09:46,179 --> 00:09:48,949
hey dude there are ways not to listen to

332
00:09:48,949 --> 00:09:50,989
this right like talking you've had a

333
00:09:50,989 --> 00:09:52,489
couple years to create a defense against

334
00:09:52,489 --> 00:09:54,139
this cap and Sam must have stopped off

335
00:09:54,139 --> 00:09:55,519
for Starbucks enroute to the holding

336
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:56,839
room so that Bucky had enough time to

337
00:09:56,839 --> 00:09:58,489
provide the mission report to Zemo and

338
00:09:58,489 --> 00:10:00,529
kill all these government agents Jesus

339
00:10:00,529 --> 00:10:01,670
this fight is like trying to watch

340
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,649
people play Marvel vs. Capcom and trying

341
00:10:03,649 --> 00:10:04,549
to figure out what the fuck is happening

342
00:10:04,549 --> 00:10:06,739
okay if we have to remove three sins for

343
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:08,629
this I guess we would sin counter will

344
00:10:08,629 --> 00:10:11,110
not be happy

345
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,009
government agents and the rest of the

346
00:10:13,009 --> 00:10:14,809
Avengers took their union mandated smoke

347
00:10:14,809 --> 00:10:16,369
break during the whole escape chopper

348
00:10:16,369 --> 00:10:18,679
crash scene cuz I'm not the only one or

349
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:20,779
soldier remember Bucky's only the Winter

350
00:10:20,779 --> 00:10:22,279
Soldier because Zola remembered he got

351
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:23,600
thrown off the train in the first movie

352
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,980
and went backpacking in the mountains to

353
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,209
pick him up later for some dumbass

354
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:27,949
reason what's so special about Bucky

355
00:10:27,949 --> 00:10:29,420
that they need to give him the serum in

356
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,799
the first place and they kidnapped a

357
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:32,299
whole bunch of people in 1991 and gave

358
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:34,189
them the serum and doesn't Hydra know

359
00:10:34,189 --> 00:10:35,720
the ingredients of this cocktail they

360
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,489
had access to Zola for years I guess

361
00:10:37,489 --> 00:10:38,749
they didn't because Bucky had to kill

362
00:10:38,749 --> 00:10:40,100
Tony's parents forward and set up the

363
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,269
spite at the entities they can take a

364
00:10:41,269 --> 00:10:43,040
whole country down in one night you

365
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,209
never see them coming

366
00:10:44,209 --> 00:10:45,769
why haven't they that I know in Winter

367
00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:47,149
Soldier Zola said something about blah

368
00:10:47,149 --> 00:10:49,009
blah take away freedom blah blah people

369
00:10:49,009 --> 00:10:50,959
resist but if you have 30 super soldiers

370
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,850
all created before the Avengers existed

371
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:54,259
then why not use them to do that very

372
00:10:54,259 --> 00:10:56,209
thing who knows if the Accords a lot of

373
00:10:56,209 --> 00:10:57,860
help but they're not ratified yet

374
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:02,119
remember bomb 72 hours guaranteed 36

375
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:04,309
hours arbitrary timeline is arbitrary

376
00:11:04,309 --> 00:11:05,929
that's you right

377
00:11:05,929 --> 00:11:07,610
I must know this because somewhere in

378
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:09,019
this YouTube video you take off your

379
00:11:09,019 --> 00:11:10,759
mask 100 times following the existing

380
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:12,619
movies patterns and I've had these

381
00:11:12,619 --> 00:11:14,329
powers for six months Peters only had

382
00:11:14,329 --> 00:11:15,889
his Spidey powers for six months but

383
00:11:15,889 --> 00:11:17,509
Tony's had time to scout him study the

384
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:18,949
strength of his webbing and build a suit

385
00:11:18,949 --> 00:11:22,160
form you can't overpower me I know I did

386
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,649
she can why did she change her mind she

387
00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:25,819
went from I've caused enough problems

388
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:27,410
and I think I'm in love with vision to

389
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:28,879
screw it in 30 seconds all because

390
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:33,110
Hawkeye told her to stop moping

391
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:35,910
wait did Wanda just send vision to hell

392
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:38,730
come on yeah when we're stopped -

393
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:40,500
Hawkeye a pic cap side just because

394
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,060
Quicksilver saved him in age of Ultron

395
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,680
you can't assume he'd go against the

396
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,910
other Avengers just to give Wanda a

397
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:48,029
right move well you will be moved as

398
00:11:48,029 --> 00:11:50,220
entertaining as that would be it

399
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:53,009
wouldn't there'd be 1767 cuts just for

400
00:11:53,009 --> 00:11:54,750
them to end up being friends anyway so

401
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:55,829
if you come with us you're a wanted man

402
00:11:55,829 --> 00:11:58,139
yeah well what else is new so much for

403
00:11:58,139 --> 00:11:59,250
spending time with her daughter which

404
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,480
was the whole reason you wanted to be a

405
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,500
good guy in your own movie

406
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,180
Cap'n Tony take an hour and a half to

407
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,829
start syllable war in your old war buddy

408
00:12:04,829 --> 00:12:06,089
killed innocent people yesterday and

409
00:12:06,089 --> 00:12:07,709
there are five more super soldiers just

410
00:12:07,709 --> 00:12:09,089
like them but what's not important to

411
00:12:09,089 --> 00:12:10,230
tell you at this moment is that Bucky

412
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,819
had no control over his actions because

413
00:12:11,819 --> 00:12:12,870
there's a complicated series of

414
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,550
passwords that evil people programmed

415
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:16,319
him with and off oh come on

416
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:17,940
these webs are so strong that cap

417
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,259
himself can't get free of them but

418
00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:21,060
Hawkeye's arrows are good enough ant-man

419
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,620
chooses to attack spider-man first

420
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,959
because arthropods I guess you have a

421
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,839
metal arm that is awesome dude thank God

422
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,550
they got a great actor got Spidey just

423
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:33,240
right even if he wasn't a Don you know

424
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,160
thank God Ironman decided to blast that

425
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,630
arrow out of the air there's no telling

426
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,709
what kind of property damage that would

427
00:12:37,709 --> 00:12:39,029
have done don't worry no one will be

428
00:12:39,029 --> 00:12:40,050
killed in the beautiful action

429
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,490
centerpiece of this movie so sit back

430
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:42,660
and enjoy the other lack of stakes

431
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,370
because we only know Steve and Tony

432
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:45,870
strong feelings on the sokovia accords

433
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,910
the other combatants in this melee start

434
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,439
to run together I've got to remember

435
00:12:49,439 --> 00:12:51,630
Natasha's on Tony's side because reasons

436
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,009
Rhodey and vision are on Tony's side

437
00:12:53,009 --> 00:12:53,880
because they're boring

438
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,740
Black Panthers simply only anti Winter

439
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,209
Soldier side Spidey's in it for the

440
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:58,800
money just like the studios involved

441
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,569
ant-man and Hawkeye are on Steve's side

442
00:13:00,569 --> 00:13:02,550
because trying to figure that out

443
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:03,839
vonda's on Steve's side because of peer

444
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,759
pressure but I generally forget every

445
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:07,259
bit of that after every 10 seconds of

446
00:13:07,259 --> 00:13:09,120
random hero and hero violence I didn't

447
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:09,779
kill your father

448
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:12,389
why did you run what kind of question is

449
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:13,860
that he was running because you were

450
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,660
chasing him in a scary cat suit doesn't

451
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,009
it feel like Scarlet Witch could just

452
00:13:17,009 --> 00:13:18,689
end this whole battle right now you know

453
00:13:18,689 --> 00:13:20,279
because she's the one who practices real

454
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:20,790
magic

455
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:23,730
you got a hard kid are you from please

456
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:25,949
Brooklyn does Brooklyn have that kind of

457
00:13:25,949 --> 00:13:27,870
hard reputation anymore I mean isn't

458
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:29,279
book won one of the most gentrifying us

459
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,420
places in the world right now

460
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,769
I mean maybe because cap comes from

461
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,209
old-school Brooklyn he still wears that

462
00:13:33,209 --> 00:13:35,130
like a badge but I for one can't wait to

463
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:36,839
decorate my bed-stuy brownstone with

464
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:38,459
French coffee shop posters and my three

465
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:40,290
bicycles I'll take the vision you get to

466
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:42,389
the jack by the way Tony side could stop

467
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:43,740
this whole thing by simply destroying

468
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,480
the jet for disabling it nobody

469
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,339
gonna do that alright Sam what's the

470
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:48,899
plan we need a diversion

471
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:49,800
The Avengers always have these

472
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,240
communication devices built into their

473
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,949
uniforms but if half of them are using

474
00:13:52,949 --> 00:13:54,149
them shouldn't the other half be able to

475
00:13:54,149 --> 00:13:55,769
hear the same conversation did they meet

476
00:13:55,769 --> 00:13:57,300
earlier and determine which side uses

477
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:00,690
which frequency it's just the title of

478
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:06,510
the movie is all Paul Rudd is such a

479
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,279
goddamn national treasure and a welcome

480
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:09,570
bit of levity in this movie that I'm

481
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:11,269
removing a sin for his awesomeness

482
00:14:11,269 --> 00:14:13,139
vision finally decides to start

483
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:15,269
visioning also seriously did this movie

484
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:16,529
just have no clue how to use this

485
00:14:16,529 --> 00:14:17,940
character all he's done is a spouse

486
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,680
random wisdom cook and wear some j.crew

487
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,050
not gonna stop what the hell is she been

488
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:23,399
doing this whole time she got knocked

489
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:25,019
out of the battle earlier so then she

490
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:26,850
decided to hang out by the jet she was

491
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:27,990
gonna be the last defense against

492
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:29,910
captain freakin America heartbeat

493
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,350
detected why don't we just call this

494
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:33,209
movie civil unrest or domestic

495
00:14:33,209 --> 00:14:34,740
disturbance to the one without Vince

496
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,720
Vaughn what's so wor about this civil

497
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,980
anyway sorry just like my mom said it's

498
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,269
all fun and games until someone gets

499
00:14:42,269 --> 00:14:43,860
knocked out of the sky by an infinity

500
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,660
stone and breaks their back where police

501
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,730
also found a wig and facial prosthesis

502
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:49,829
approximating the appearance of one

503
00:14:49,829 --> 00:14:52,980
James Buchanan Barnes Zemo seriously

504
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,930
found ways to do amazing things over one

505
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:56,519
year's time he's not only great with

506
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:58,019
computers and decrypting classified

507
00:14:58,019 --> 00:14:59,579
documents but also making a mask of

508
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:01,170
Barnes that fools facial recognition

509
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:04,139
software get this - Ross which one also

510
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:05,579
if he's sending it to Ross why can't

511
00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:06,930
Tony also send the information - black

512
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:08,579
panther whom he knows is still hunting

513
00:15:08,579 --> 00:15:10,019
Bucky does this facility still have

514
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:10,410
power

515
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,600
start facial scanning for this Simo guy

516
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,160
you seriously think I'm gonna listen to

517
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,069
you after that Fiasco in Leipzig look

518
00:15:17,069 --> 00:15:18,149
you're not in one of these cells

519
00:15:18,149 --> 00:15:19,949
high-ranking government official thinks

520
00:15:19,949 --> 00:15:21,510
he's in a Transformers movie in ignores

521
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:22,949
obvious evidence of an international

522
00:15:22,949 --> 00:15:24,839
catastrophe did he give you anything on

523
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:26,699
Rogers not told me to go to hell Ross

524
00:15:26,699 --> 00:15:28,440
who doesn't trust stark when it comes to

525
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,970
Zima suddenly trust stark in the

526
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:32,630
situation and doesn't haven't followed

527
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:35,240
oh how lucky Black Panther just happens

528
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,069
to be five seconds behind Ironman even

529
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:38,480
though he was secretly following cap and

530
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,100
Bucky the whole time what was your name

531
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:40,370
again

532
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:42,889
Dolores you called her da Steve

533
00:15:42,889 --> 00:15:44,209
remembers the name of some random

534
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:45,949
redhead Bucky tried to impress more than

535
00:15:45,949 --> 00:15:47,959
seventy years ago okay a cabin Bucky no

536
00:15:47,959 --> 00:15:49,670
the exact coordinates and they have a

537
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:51,259
serious head start Tony had to take

538
00:15:51,259 --> 00:15:52,759
Rhodey to the hospital chat with scar

539
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:54,889
Joe right out to the wavy prison talk to

540
00:15:54,889 --> 00:15:56,540
Papa Doc to get the location then fly

541
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,610
all the way to goddamn Siberia but they

542
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:00,410
arrived if roughly the same time I know

543
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:02,420
that run you know that road what about

544
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,250
that date maybe that's more recognizable

545
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,050
yeah just incredible footage on a tree

546
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:08,329
line country road km3 as it turns out

547
00:16:08,329 --> 00:16:10,250
cams everywhere in the area you never

548
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,660
know when Bigfoot might be around and

549
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,370
the footage was saved even though we're

550
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:14,720
seeing this in full color the movies

551
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,430
trying to say Tony can see this same

552
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:18,199
angle in footage - driving home the

553
00:16:18,199 --> 00:16:19,310
drama of his mother getting strangled

554
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:21,170
but really all he'd be able to see is

555
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:22,699
Bucky standing next to the car doing

556
00:16:22,699 --> 00:16:24,680
something probably bad presumably this

557
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,180
means he shot the camera but it was

558
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,769
conveniently impervious considering we

559
00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:29,480
have this footage also suddenly this

560
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,889
movie is saying there was a facility

561
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:32,360
nearby that could capture security

562
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,860
footage first off that's terribly

563
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,480
convenient but second off terrible

564
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,370
nonsense because there was no such place

565
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:38,899
nearby in the beginning of the movie now

566
00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:40,639
Tony gets mad even though he knows for a

567
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,079
fact that Bucky had no control over his

568
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:43,699
actions or is this movie saying he

569
00:16:43,699 --> 00:16:45,380
didn't I find that hard to believe

570
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,880
and even though he just learned somebody

571
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,589
framed Bucky ten minutes ago he gets

572
00:16:48,589 --> 00:16:50,389
blinded with anger this conflict as his

573
00:16:50,389 --> 00:16:51,740
manufactured as it gets

574
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:54,050
did you know yes to be fair the only

575
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:55,670
reason he knows is because Zola showed

576
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:57,290
him what Hydra did the people who work

577
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:58,880
for shield in that bunker scene in the

578
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,439
Winter Soldier but then right after that

579
00:17:00,439 --> 00:17:02,240
Hydra fired missiles into the building

580
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,470
and he had to make a miraculous escape

581
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:04,970
so it might have slipped his mind I

582
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:06,199
still can't believe this is the reason

583
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:07,640
they're gonna fight them all so when

584
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,319
would he tell Tony about this while they

585
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,730
were just hanging out hey man I know

586
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:12,409
where the strip club and stuff but Bucky

587
00:17:12,409 --> 00:17:14,240
killed your parents she's older you

588
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,130
wanted to see them rip each other hot

589
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:18,289
pot yep and just think he could have

590
00:17:18,289 --> 00:17:19,640
done this by simply sending the tape to

591
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,049
Tony with a little post-it note that

592
00:17:21,049 --> 00:17:23,270
read play me we're miles from harm and

593
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:26,709
the dust cleared it took me two days

594
00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:29,570
until I found that body but if they were

595
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:31,730
together how did demos survive if I

596
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:33,740
could get them to kill each other let's

597
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,659
talk about zimos plan the entire thing

598
00:17:35,659 --> 00:17:36,919
relies on Scarlet Witch doing something

599
00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:38,360
incredibly stupid during the crossbones

600
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,860
fight in Lagos without that there would

601
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,240
be no sokovia in the course which Zemo

602
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,290
had no idea what happened when he

603
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:43,820
started planning his revenge and yet is

604
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,350
a huge part of the plan in this movie

605
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,520
then he plots to bomb the

606
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,350
when frame Bucky and somehow someway he

607
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,460
knows Steve and Tony will hate each

608
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,110
other over it and he also knows Tony

609
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:51,980
will figure out about the dead

610
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,690
psychiatrist at the perfect time learn

611
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:55,490
the Siberia location and show up at the

612
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:56,840
same time as captain bucket he knows

613
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,460
Steve won't tell Tony what he knows that

614
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,930
it lose all control and they'll fight

615
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:01,400
each other in this building I mean how

616
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,080
does mo know all this just by pouring

617
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,000
over a Natasha's Wikileaks analyze his

618
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,850
fight pattern scanning oh sure you can

619
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:09,350
analyze his fight pattern but your

620
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:10,670
targeting system a minute ago was

621
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:12,260
totally messed up your does whatever

622
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:15,320
this movie needs doesn't it again he's

623
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,270
not gonna die what a pussy this movie is

624
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:19,970
Valentine all that effort will see it

625
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:23,660
fail so spectacularly did it well pretty

626
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,850
much yeah I mean Bucky lost an arm but

627
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:27,590
generally cap and Tony are good to go

628
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:29,180
for infinity war unless they're saying

629
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,130
there's more to zimos plan like he's

630
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:32,690
Joker in the Dark Knight and he needed

631
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:34,130
to be captured more proof that the

632
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:35,480
filmmakers lost sight of their vision

633
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,280
Stan Lee finally makes an appearance in

634
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,900
one of these Marvel movies geez only

635
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,550
took 13 tries but they found a way to

636
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,410
pay tribute to him yeah I guess I

637
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:44,570
thought by not telling you about your

638
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:46,970
parents I was sparing you but I can see

639
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:48,530
now that I was really sparing myself

640
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:51,380
from what also the I didn't tell you so

641
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,790
that I could protect you cliche once

642
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:54,410
again aren't you glad that you waited 10

643
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:55,550
minutes to see this thing and you have

644
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:56,300
no clue what it is

645
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,890
guess I'm gonna have to go research this

646
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:03,649
now thanks Obama

647
00:19:03,649 --> 00:19:08,180

leads to anger anger leads to hate hate

651

for more than a year Donald Trump has

652
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:26,010
been the people's champion they can take
