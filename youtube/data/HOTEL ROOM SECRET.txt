1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
yeah

2
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,040
I don't think police officers should write on segways there's just there's no

3
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,040
way to ride a segway with dignity

4
00:00:26,009 --> 00:00:29,670
i'm in san francisco

5
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,989
I'm here for work whatever last night I was looking for a hotel room online and

6
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:39,390
like this fancy hotel bedrooms for super crazy cheap like fifty percent off

7
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,710
so this is the room it's not so bad it's very small it's not so that look at the

8
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,710
view

9
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:57,980
haha that the views of like a pit of concrete

10
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:11,830
so this is what my view was that

11
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:15,330
your fortune

12
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:34,700
whoa

13
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:25,319
yeah

14
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:28,319
hit it with my head up my luggage

15
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:39,260
interesting side note a couple years ago I made a video or commercial for j.crew

16
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:42,260
suits

17
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,910
this

18
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:49,420
and we shot part of it in this lobby no permission

19
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,420
no permits nothing we just shot it

20
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:04,599
just as I was leaving that hotel a lovely young lady I think her name was

21
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:07,870
Melissa came up to me introduce yourself as the head of public relations or

22
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,219
something for the hotel

23
00:03:09,219 --> 00:03:12,549
I just want to clear I wasn't complaining about my view the room was

24
00:03:12,549 --> 00:03:14,739
like a super great price great deal

25
00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:19,359
I had a wonderful stay I did I did I hope I didn't get you in trouble for

26
00:03:19,359 --> 00:03:22,359
finally on the roof

27
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:34,990
here in San Francisco for the day for a bunch of business meetings the beam

28
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,820
launched last week was insane

29
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:40,630
hundreds of thousands of new users more people downloading it every single day

30
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:45,010
so now you're meeting with my investors and advisors just to discuss with the

31
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:47,950
future of the company looks like honestly it's not particularly

32
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:51,820
interesting blog material so if you want to stop watching right now I totally

33
