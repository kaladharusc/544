1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,009
I want you to be upset we do our part is my home

2
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:38,450
I am a half hours in a week

3
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:41,310
our flight got three hours of landing

4
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,079
seven hours back to be a little

5
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:46,079
I cannot tell you how good it is worried about the baby

6
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,470
for peace for

7
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:51,470
silvers work

8
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:10,460
yeah

9
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:19,570
people sitting out there

10
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,280
some sort of police situation

11
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,130
thank you for a ride

12
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:33,210
police will let us leave the plane and they boarded our plane like machine guns

13
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:39,160
make that they were on the wrong plane they left that was the police station

14
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,160
sure is a lot less fun without canvas and Francine

15
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,080
yeah

16
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:08,250
there is nothing like a shower and a shave and fresh socks and make you feel

17
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,090
make you feel ready to start the day thank you got a new man

18
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:26,939
that shower oaks made me late for my flight and I don't get to buy food not

19
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:29,900
stick to texts

20
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,900

21
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:44,550
one except for one very much for the same cases since I child right

22
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:49,410

23
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:55,460

24
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,520

28
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:28,340
clips they weren't very interesting

29
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:36,269
ok ok what do you think the taxis are on their way

30
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:43,560

31
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,280
yes

32
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,880

33
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:07,160
ok

34
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:10,090

35
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:11,770

37
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:27,770
man does it feel good to be back

38
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:31,370
i miss the studio so much

39
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:34,370
well lookie lookie what do we have here

40
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:42,860
just the latest and greatest unreleased pre production version of the new canon

41
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:46,220
8d so get this the day I left for South Africa

42
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:53,600
I got a phone call from B&H Photo saying they had an early version of the can and

43
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,500
a TD that I could have I just had to go picture is the day I left

44
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,890
so this is actually been sitting here for the entire time I was in South

45
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:04,070
Africa first huge thank you to be h for making this happen

46
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:08,390
so I don't get to keep this exact model this is like literally a pre production

47
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:11,210
version that has to be sent back to canon

48
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:15,380
when they have the production versions that commit so like this is a precious

49
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:21,410
very early special thing to have those of you who are not total nerds like me

50
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:25,370
the canon 70d is the main camera what I'm sitting on right now that I used for

51
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:29,630
this vlog the 8th ed is its successor which is supposed to be better in ways

52
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,890
that I don't really understand

53
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:33,890
needless to say i'm pretty excited about this thing

54
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,160
now i'm going to switch cameras from the 7th ed to the a.d.d ready

55
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:02,280
this is the 8th ed are you prop this is the old 70d here he probably can't tell

56
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:06,210
i think the difference this is not the best situation to like but expect a full

57
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:07,350
review from me

58
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:10,410
if you're a regular viewer of the blog you know I always say that and I never

59
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:13,050
actually do the full review but maybe this time I will

60
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:21,660
all right I got to go well I have kind of an embarrassing problem here as a

61
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:25,919
sitting here playing with this camera from B&H Photo two spots showed up from

62
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,940
Kane em photo and then is the photo or just a office

63
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,710
they're also great I don't cross the owner for a while

64
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:46,680
generally there's this awesome folks I can't tell you how flattering this is

65
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:53,430
due

66
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:56,610
first of all thank you Obama always a pleasure thanks for the support

67
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:01,860
there's a small problem though you gave me one literally at the same moment that

68
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,139
BH gave me when your competitor

69
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:07,770
ok how do i resolve that how do i be gracious

70
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:11,639
well we're right below you and we support you all the time

71
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,940
how can you compete with that okay yeah you can't computer bag with that

72
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:18,030
shop shop New York City local camera stores

73
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:21,389
thank you come say hi to one thank you baby - 600

74
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:27,139
all right later guys thanks to get one that's a good night

75
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:33,080
then create an advertising feature of the basement for five ten o'clock go

76
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,860
home from work now has a little later in this camera any better

77
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:52,850
this house is so empty and so lonely without canvas and without friends seem

78
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:56,570
to think this might be the first night i've ever slept here alone

79
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:08,570
that is so sad i don't know maybe we could do like a human shark repellents

80
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:11,570
like excess of that

81
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:32,479
I thought Dan was messing with me I hoped dan was nothing really

82
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,140
I don't think he was any last-minute words of wisdom

83
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:39,410
broadwave picture okay yeah
