2
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:10,340
isn't about time these assholes merge

3
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:11,990
these two logos into one and spare us

4
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:13,400
the forty-five seconds it takes to suck

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,980
their own nice hot cake guilt cake this

6
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:17,540
shutting Jesus another fish is gone

7
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:19,310
missing speak me feel like the NSA dude

8
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:20,540
at the end of Hunt for Red October

9
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:23,390
you've lost another submarine hi I'm

10
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:26,419
dory can you please help me Finding Nemo

11
00:00:26,419 --> 00:00:27,980
opened with a gut-punching emotional

12
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:29,450
scene of loss of life setting the

13
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:31,340
urgency tone early this movie opens with

14
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:33,230
the scene of a forgetful child then cuts

15
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:34,520
straight to her being alone we could

16
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,840
have done itself tons of favors by

17
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,430
showing us the actual moment Dory lost

18
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:38,900
track of her family but instead we just

19
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,970
lost that daughter she could come from

20
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:43,670
anywhere Wow you are you are no help

21
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:45,620
today movie gets terrific comic actors

22
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,090
Bill Hader and Kate McKinnon - voice

23
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:48,620
fish but then gives them nothing else to

24
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:49,940
do in the whole movie which is a waste

25
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:51,620
the sin is for the fact that her blindly

26
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:53,270
trusting ass hasn't been gobble hole by

27
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:54,770
a bigger fish yet the idea that fish

28
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:56,150
come up to the surface to stare at the

29
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:57,860
stars that's actually laughably stupid

30
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,780
but whatever good milky way shot Pixar

31
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,560
you're perfect I'm dory

32
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,299
was it something I said no it was you

33
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:06,710
popping out of nowhere suddenly thereby

34
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:08,030
scaring them are you stupid

35
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:11,689
in addition to having memory issues

36
00:01:11,689 --> 00:01:14,600
Finding Nemo origins a whole year making

37
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,710
it a whole year is going to make it very

38
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,210
hard for me to swallow the dory will be

39
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:18,920
successful in finding her parents also

40
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,000
be telling me that after the original

41
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,829
Finding Nemo adventures she's managed to

42
00:01:21,829 --> 00:01:23,270
stick around but then a whole year after

43
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:24,560
that she's gonna wander off think

44
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,409
seriously about three sharks no no there

45
00:01:27,409 --> 00:01:29,780
were definitely four last time he told

46
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:31,159
it there were three movie decides

47
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:32,719
Marlene is a compulsive liar which was

48
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:34,099
not a trait he displayed prior to this

49
00:01:34,099 --> 00:01:35,750
movie but whatever sequels got to find

50
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:38,060
humor where they can almost miss field

51
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:38,599
trip

52
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:40,069
even though Dory got you up early where

53
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:42,289
are we going I thought you told I didn't

54
00:01:42,289 --> 00:01:44,149
tell her yeah Marlon but why did you

55
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:45,110
bring her here if you told her she

56
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:46,399
couldn't go on the field trip anyway and

57
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:47,420
has it Nemo been through enough she

58
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:49,009
could have made this trip on his own I

59
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:51,770
mean one year later says how I am so

60
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,539
honored I have never been a teaching

61
00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:56,569
assistant before mr. Wray you got help

62
00:01:56,569 --> 00:01:58,250
Marlon who has absolutely nothing to do

63
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,899
gives up on trying to tell dory she

64
00:01:59,899 --> 00:02:01,280
can't go on this field trip after one

65
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,659
misunderstanding but I guess he's busy

66
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:04,429
and all with all the many anemone

67
00:02:04,429 --> 00:02:07,099
amenities back at home you see kids when

68
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:09,979
two fish love each other man will stop

69
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:10,819
right there

70
00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:12,170
apparently dory who was never taught

71
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:13,459
about reproduction knows about

72
00:02:13,459 --> 00:02:15,440
reproduction and also the act of egg

73
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,150
fertilization is given the same Puritan

74
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:19,040
embarrassment as human reproduction even

75
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,569
though these kids are a year older and

76
00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:22,430
should already know this I remembered

77
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:24,109
something luckily this class mr. ray

78
00:02:24,109 --> 00:02:26,150
taught today contained exactly the sort

79
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,650
of clues Dory needed to kick-start her

80
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,090
journey and she doesn't forget them

81
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:30,680
within seconds making her memory in this

82
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,120
movie super convenient something

83
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,430
important what how's Marlon here right

84
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,750
now did he get a premonition about

85
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,400
checking on mr. Ray's field trip and

86
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,410
somehow find all these assholes then

87
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:41,000
somehow found Dory even though she was

88
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,530
carried into the undertow and a mass of

89
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:45,349
stingrays somewhere out there is my

90
00:02:45,349 --> 00:02:47,840
family it's a massively ginormous ocean

91
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,040
though do you really think you can

92
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,660
strike finding a missing fish goal twice

93
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,730
also it takes nearly 1/3 of this finding

94
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,590
Dory movie for Dory to even go looking

95
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,299
for herself you can get us all the way

96
00:02:56,299 --> 00:03:00,079
across the ocean right no but I know a

97
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:01,790
guy good thing it's been a whole year

98
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:03,410
and these turtles are migrating again

99
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:05,450
huh also as happy as I am to see dude

100
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:07,280
crush again he rides the East Australian

101
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,720
current and shouldn't have anything

102
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,160
knowledge or ability to get these fish

103
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,900
to California sea turtles are not an

104
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,090
entire globe inhabited species sequel to

105
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:15,620
Finding Nemo perpetuates the myth of

106
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,150
clownfish being able to hold on to

107
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,980
turtle shells during this speedy tubular

108
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:22,430
journey

109
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:24,319
squirt hasn't aged a day in the last

110
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,970
year I'm concerned about his growth in

111
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:27,620
lack of nutrition Dory somehow doesn't

112
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,900
see or doesn't react to this scary giant

113
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,370
ass eyeball that appears right in her

114
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:32,959
field of view while Marlene is talking

115
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,730
once again predator decides to announce

116
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:36,080
itself instead of just killing these

117
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,670
fish right now have you ever seen that

118
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,530
show animal ninja warriors yeah of

119
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:40,940
course don't announce their presence

120
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,620
they just suddenly snapped and they're

121
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,060
dead 20,000 Leagues Under the

122
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,100
entertainment value also fortunately for

123
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,690
the scene setting an entire cargo ship

124
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:49,610
at all its containers sunk here and all

125
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:51,110
those containers have stayed stacked on

126
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:53,110
the ship despite the 45-degree angle

127
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:55,070
this is why you don't bring your child

128
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:57,100
on intercontinental ocean adventures

129
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:00,019
physics ex machina you can go wait over

130
00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:03,260
there go wait over there and forget it's

131
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,220
what you do best

132
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,080
this is super mean for a fish that's

133
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,610
lived near her and called her friend and

134
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:09,170
tolerated her forgetfulness for an

135
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:10,880
entire year and now of course she's

136
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,290
going to get just far enough to get

137
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:13,819
separated from them to cause further

138
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:15,500
calamity all because Marlin was an

139
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,600
uncharacteristic dick I'm sick warning

140
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,609
neither why is audio intended for human

141
00:04:19,609 --> 00:04:21,440
guests of the park so audible from

142
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,419
outside and underwater other than to

143
00:04:23,419 --> 00:04:25,280
advance the plot I mean do they actually

144
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,810
have speakers underwater so all the fish

145
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:28,669
can hear this too where we believe in

146
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:32,479
rescue rehabilitation and release except

147
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:33,890
all the fish who can help Dory find her

148
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:34,280
parents

149
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,600
they aren't released yet that would be

150
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,430
silly and why would a marine life

151
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,050
Institute in California have a picture

152
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:40,580
on the wall of the Australian dentists

153
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,680
nice from the first movie and how old is

154
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,510
that apple 2e computer back there octopi

155
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,430
can camouflage but that's very different

156
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:48,260
from complete invisibility there wasn't

157
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,940
even a telltale lumpier meaning this

158
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,340
octopus can also camouflage his 3d body

159
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,470
into something 2d if I just take your

160
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:56,510
tag I can take your place on the

161
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:57,979
transport truck how the hell does he

162
00:04:57,979 --> 00:04:59,600
think he's getting this tag off this is

163
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,070
one of those super impossible cable ties

164
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,870
no maybe it's because he's not too puss

165
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,729
he doesn't know that but he does know

166
00:05:04,729 --> 00:05:05,900
something about Cleveland and

167
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,520
understands human speech so you can

168
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,990
forgive us for being assholes about that

169
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:10,880
I suffer from short-term memory loss

170
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,110
it's kind of a drag she has to keep

171
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:13,700
saying this over and over because it

172
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,720
makes the movie kind of boring

173
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,950
we're supposed to be releasing the

174
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:18,050
octopus back to the ocean today amazing

175
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,550
this octopus was planning his Prison

176
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,050
Break on the very day Dory got captured

177
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:22,610
and these two could start some sort of

178
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:23,750
symbiotic relationship

179
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,039
how does Hank look green when his

180
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,360
camouflage takes the color of his

181
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,950
surroundings there's no green here

182
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,419
except for on the map and it's not in

183
00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:31,099
range by the way nice job making the

184
00:05:31,099 --> 00:05:32,720
octopus basically Randall from monsters

185
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,520
Inc

186
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:39,490
look shells huh Jesus this movie is like

187
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:41,259
momento across with Slumdog Millionaire

188
00:05:41,259 --> 00:05:42,699
Dory's memory is inconvenient until the

189
00:05:42,699 --> 00:05:44,319
world which is conducting some sort of

190
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,090
parental scavenger hunt provides perfect

191
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:48,430
clues at the perfect time base this is

192
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:52,930
Carol missing octopus oh what a liar

193
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,490
when did you ever see the octopus during

194
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,349
this walk down the stairs yeah you might

195
00:05:56,349 --> 00:05:57,940
have stepped on octopus goop

196
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,050
but you didn't get visual confirmation

197
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:03,759
so stop lying you lying liar hmm destiny

198
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,520
oh destiny destiny is not only the name

199
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,860
of a whale dory knows but the mantra by

200
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,389
which this screenplay was written Dori

201
00:06:10,389 --> 00:06:11,620
knocks over the coffeepot without

202
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,940
breaking it or making a noise and

203
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,889
absolutely nobody will wonder wife and

204
00:06:14,889 --> 00:06:18,520
coffee pot is suddenly here this

205
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,050
employee can't hear Hanks grunts and

206
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:21,669
loud ass monkey barring also this

207
00:06:21,669 --> 00:06:23,380
octopus is so James Bond I'm wondering

208
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,460
how he hasn't broken out of this place

209
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,020
on his own yet or found and put himself

210
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,400
in whatever tank he's trying to get to

211
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,560
and then this person absent mindedly

212
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,569
throws a regal blue tang out into the

213
00:06:31,569 --> 00:06:32,319
whale shark tank

214
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,440
I mean people look at things right

215
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,030
friends know we've talked through the

216
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,770
pipes when we were little we were pen

217
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:39,340
pals

218
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,960
because aquarium rehab places like this

219
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,610
always have pipes connecting each

220
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,990
exhibit for easy marine life

221
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:46,240
communication of course also know you

222
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,680
weren't pipe pals you fucking weren't

223
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,719
you you were not Dory's little voice

224
00:06:49,719 --> 00:06:51,279
couldn't carry that far or even helped

225
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:53,259
Horton here who much less be piped pals

226
00:06:53,259 --> 00:06:56,229
with a whale shark ocean exhibit hmm

227
00:06:56,229 --> 00:06:57,849
fish with a memory problem a shark with

228
00:06:57,849 --> 00:07:00,069
an eyesight problem Nemo's weak fin it's

229
00:07:00,069 --> 00:07:01,210
almost as if these movies think

230
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:03,039
disabilities are easy joke fodder I'm

231
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,719
sorry but there's no other way there's

232
00:07:04,719 --> 00:07:09,819
no other way now this movie is getting

233
00:07:09,819 --> 00:07:11,409
fucking ridiculous like Dory spent a

234
00:07:11,409 --> 00:07:12,759
whole year not hearing anything that

235
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:14,409
reminded her of her parents now she's

236
00:07:14,409 --> 00:07:16,000
had a virtual treasure trove of memory

237
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,860
joggers in one day and maybe the movie

238
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,300
is saying her memory is simply just

239
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,469
getting better but it's still a

240
00:07:20,469 --> 00:07:22,120
ridiculous amount of reminders in a

241
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,440
short amount of time what are we even

242
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,529
doing we're cooling along in the animal

243
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:27,880
kingdom the pronoun game is a huge

244
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,500
problem even worse than poaching or

245
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,099
overfishing

246
00:07:30,099 --> 00:07:31,779
Nikki keeps humorously pecking Marlatt

247
00:07:31,779 --> 00:07:33,909
but isn't this beak of beak like tear

248
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:35,560
fish and other small prey apart gotta be

249
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,050
all you have to do is imprint with at

250
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:39,849
night oh man they drank Twilight

251
00:07:39,849 --> 00:07:42,100
Breaking Dawn too into this didn't they

252
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,760
Jackley is becky supposed to carry us oh

253
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,410
man how many lost fish have broken their

254
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:48,850
way into quarantine using becky and a

255
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:50,650
sand pail these sea lions make it sound

256
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:52,540
like all the time hey movie how did

257
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,400
these two get out of the tank and across

258
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,230
the massive human walkway to hide in the

259
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:58,030
stroller I know you glossed over it but

260
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:01,180
I cannot still not clear these assholes

261
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,680
watching two amazingly large sea

262
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,360
creatures are not in any way dumbfounded

263
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,890
at this kind of behavior right now just

264
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:07,630
the belugas posture alone with its fin

265
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:08,830
in the air would make me want to call

266
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,660
the park authorities mad on the loose

267
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,100
baby stroller driving through families

268
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,840
and other moms but nobody gives a hey

269
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,480
the world's most powerful pair of I know

270
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,820
that why do I know that no idea since

271
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,110
you were just a little baby when you

272
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:21,580
left and I can't think of one reason why

273
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,170
you'd ever see that sign while in

274
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,610
captivity this feels sort of like the

275
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:26,440
traffic cone thing in Toy Story 2 where

276
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,300
miraculously no one is observant and no

277
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,190
one even as much just walks by this tree

278
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,810
with a pail of fish in it tree limb has

279
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:33,910
unreal catapulting powers and insane

280
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:35,680
accuracy by throwing Marlon and Nemo

281
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,419
into a fish tank but would definitely be

282
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:38,919
sitting around outside a gift shop but

283
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,450
thank goodness they landed in water am i

284
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:41,740
right what are the odds of that by the

285
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,510
way I believe my disbelief has served

286
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:44,920
its proper suspension when it comes to

287
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,540
this octopus driven stroller that no one

288
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,070
in this entire building notices and is

289
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:52,570
now on full alert Bullock status lucky

290
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:54,640
alcove of wackiness that's it

291
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,560
you have wasted my time wait no that

292
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,570
transport truck leaves it gone and I'm

293
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:00,430
not missing it so give me your tag I

294
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:02,080
honestly can't argue with a single thing

295
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,850
this guy says here why would a spiky

296
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:05,260
fish like this be put in the children's

297
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,670
touch pool do you want to get sued

298
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,140
because this is how you get sued she

299
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,400
remembers that just keep swimming song

300
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,080
from her childhood and decides that his

301
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,580
advice for her current situation and

302
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,680
despite all logic it apparently is you

303
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,000
made her feel like she couldn't do it

304
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,650
didn't we cover this in the first movie

305
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:19,510
we're really covering it again seriously

306
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,100
she would just look at the first thing

307
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:25,810
she sees and it's at this point Jeremy

308
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:27,850
lost his ability to sigh this is a sigh

309
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:29,890
moma the movie thoroughly extinguished

310
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:31,600
all of them in the first 30 minutes so

311
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,910
I've been forced to do it sigh gave all

312
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:38,570
hold on to me physics

313
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:41,000
right this tag comes off way too easily

314
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,350
considering what we know about it which

315
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:44,300
is way too much my parents are actually

316
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,460
down there probably not actually but

317
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,640
whatever there we go now if you ever get

318
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,620
lost doors by doors parents not being in

319
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,150
this tank for quite some time the shells

320
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,710
they let out still managed to keep their

321
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:56,810
trail over a whole year that why you're

322
00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:01,460
not in quarantine quarantine the ex

323
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,660
Malkin is in this movie could fill a

324
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:05,050
whole series of Harry Potter novels

325
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:09,680
sorry hello pipe bouncing saves the day

326
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,480
with a lucky whale who uses echolocation

327
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,670
in the other tank I mean I'd settle for

328
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:15,200
a convenient trail of Reese's Pieces at

329
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,030
this point also thankfully for dory in

330
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,500
this movie this beluga figures out his

331
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,330
echolocation abilities at just the right

332
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:22,460
time oh thank god it's Marlin a Nemo but

333
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,990
why the fuck did dude's echolocation

334
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,700
show a much larger fish this whole time

335
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,680
was it for suspense purposes I bet it

336
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,500
was you've shown me how to do stuff I

337
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,390
never dreamed of doing outsmarting

338
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:35,210
sharks and jumpin jellyfish yeah those

339
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:36,890
would be called lucky not some sort of

340
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:38,810
amazing intellectual survival skills you

341
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:41,480
made all that happen ditching I think

342
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,920
the sea turtles the Pelican and the

343
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,390
dentist tank fish deserve a lot more

344
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:45,710
credit than you're giving them here I

345
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:52,300
mean did you even see the last movie

346
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,590
this is it man just in time to be

347
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:56,120
guarded away to you were about five

348
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,530
seconds away from being on the floor in

349
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,270
debt but luck is so much on your side

350
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:00,830
you should buy a fish lottery ticket

351
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,930
right now my family and it's

352
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:04,580
miraculously lit unlike all the other

353
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,380
loser tanks in here who do you think

354
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,180
major all these open-topped fish tanks

355
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,200
were in the right order for this

356
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,880
progression of jumps the screenwriter or

357
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,230
God I want to know what kind of marine

358
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:13,970
life Institute leaves up King that of

359
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:15,410
mop water lying around during working

360
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:17,000
hours when the janitors aren't even here

361
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,830
yet also let's not forget all the

362
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:20,510
nastiness that is in this mop water that

363
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:22,130
would likely kill fish and is dumped

364
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:23,330
into another fish tank later

365
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:25,010
dilution can only do so much people tell

366
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:26,089
me

367
00:11:26,089 --> 00:11:30,170
that was years ago they never came back

368
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:31,610
how long have these blue tangs been in

369
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:33,829
the ml I to know the Dory story and just

370
00:11:33,829 --> 00:11:35,720
now the Institute decides and we'll take

371
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:41,569
him to Cleveland allmovie long door he's

372
00:11:41,569 --> 00:11:42,709
been talking about her parents and

373
00:11:42,709 --> 00:11:44,149
calling them by name but suddenly she

374
00:11:44,149 --> 00:11:46,129
forgets Marlon and Nemo and his conclude

375
00:11:46,129 --> 00:11:48,110
because the plot needs her to be Dory

376
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,459
gets out to the open sea and is so

377
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:50,959
unsure of what to do that I'm positive

378
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:52,730
she's about to accidentally herself into

379
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:54,290
her parents Dory was thrown out of the

380
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:55,910
quarantine and down a sewer grate and

381
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,350
funneled out into the sea where she

382
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,579
couldn't remember anything except what

383
00:11:58,579 --> 00:12:00,379
would Dory do miraculously this leads

384
00:12:00,379 --> 00:12:01,939
her to some kill which leads her to a

385
00:12:01,939 --> 00:12:03,470
magic seashell which leads her to her

386
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:04,819
parents who just happened to be here all

387
00:12:04,819 --> 00:12:05,329
these years

388
00:12:05,329 --> 00:12:06,980
I'm all for Dory doing this without help

389
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,389
but this officially broke me watching

390
00:12:08,389 --> 00:12:10,699
this movie way to lucky everything in

391
00:12:10,699 --> 00:12:12,290
this movie is way to lucky with the

392
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:13,939
numerous seashell trails wouldn't she

393
00:12:13,939 --> 00:12:15,410
have seen one of these well before she

394
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:16,910
actually did there are so many trails

395
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,410
here that finding any particular one

396
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:19,790
should have been easier than the miracle

397
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,230
that appeared to be a minute ago also

398
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,850
all shells lead to the Drowned radial

399
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:25,220
tire wait what okay the parents put this

400
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,569
together and hung out here for years

401
00:12:26,569 --> 00:12:28,519
just in case Dory somehow came here this

402
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:29,959
is like the parable of the talent and

403
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:31,279
these parents are the ones that buried

404
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:32,660
their talent which did not impress the

405
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,579
master it's a big thing ocean y'all last

406
00:12:34,579 --> 00:12:35,990
movie we saw what a real parent does

407
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:37,370
when a child goes missing he goes

408
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:39,199
looking for them when the dories dad's

409
00:12:39,199 --> 00:12:41,389
eyes turn hazel or whatever the color is

410
00:12:41,389 --> 00:12:43,970
why do you think we stayed tortue here

411
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,620
all these years instead of going to the

412
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,149
MLI and finding a way back in the

413
00:12:47,149 --> 00:12:48,529
exhibit which would have been way more

414
00:12:48,529 --> 00:12:50,209
logical considering the problem-solving

415
00:12:50,209 --> 00:12:52,029
skills of fish in these movies but

416
00:12:52,029 --> 00:12:53,720
Marlon and Nemo

417
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,069
oh yeah the problem that makes this

418
00:12:55,069 --> 00:12:56,990
movie feel longer than it is see when

419
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:59,059
they found me it felt like fate do you

420
00:12:59,059 --> 00:13:00,980
know what I mean oh what's another word

421
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:04,309
for fate like destiny oh we all knew

422
00:13:04,309 --> 00:13:05,779
what you meant by fate but somehow that

423
00:13:05,779 --> 00:13:07,160
triggers your thesaurus and bills you

424
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,050
out of yet another Jam it's your destiny

425
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:13,300
destiny writes itself

426
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,769
with this whale's echolocation work this

427
00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:17,720
well above water don't get used to it

428
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,490
general

429
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:20,620
Chiqui Joe why are these California sea

430
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:23,320
lions British Oh way to stop traffic

431
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,640
this is something that I highly doubt a

432
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,290
beluga whale a whale shark and a blue

433
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:27,459
tang we'll be able to figure out

434
00:13:27,459 --> 00:13:29,050
considering this is human stuff they've

435
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:30,580
never encountered but Dory gets the

436
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,990
bright idea to use these X mocking

437
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:35,890
honors to stop traffic oh honey you're

438
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:37,600
not believing us again this is actually

439
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,250
exactly like Marlin doubting Nemo at the

440
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,930
climax of the first movie is so

441
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:42,430
paint-by-numbers even Bob Ross looks

442
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:43,779
down on it from heaven

443
00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:45,160
these otters willingly stand in traffic

444
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,800
to stop it for a fish they never met

445
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,850
yeah those things just appeared out of

446
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:50,260
nowhere well within your sight one

447
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:50,800
minute ago

448
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,630
also these otters are looking dead these

449
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:54,070
cars are going too damn fast to prevent

450
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,959
roadkill right now apparently the otters

451
00:13:55,959 --> 00:13:57,459
also knew they needed to hug in the

452
00:13:57,459 --> 00:13:58,930
street or else their natural cuteness

453
00:13:58,930 --> 00:13:59,680
would not have been enough

454
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,330
none of this glass breaks after this

455
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:06,610
ruff stop by the truck I'll forgive the

456
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:08,080
cartoon speed at which this bird showed

457
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,580
up but I will not forgive the fact that

458
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,230
this bird hurt Marlins call in the first

459
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:13,990
place Dori follow me but of course she

460
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:15,430
doesn't follow because this movie is an

461
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:18,060
aggressive dickhead to stuff like ending

462
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,620
okay kid I guess this is goodbye

463
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,630
no what do you mean not the assholes who

464
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:24,010
shoot away the otters a minute ago

465
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:25,990
decided F get there's a multi-million

466
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,520
dollar animated aquatic adventure going

467
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,930
on so we'll leave the doors open for a

468
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:30,339
record amount of time to allow all that

469
00:14:30,339 --> 00:14:32,440
to happen what is so great about plans I

470
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,270
never had a plan thing that I understand

471
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,709
told the writers when this movie began

472
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:36,970
production somehow finds its way into

473
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:38,800
the script also do they have time for

474
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,630
this windows time get invented in this

475
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,370
world the best things happen by chance

476
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:44,320
because that's life this movie's message

477
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,700
seriously that we shouldn't plan for

478
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,870
stuff and just take life as it comes

479
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:48,850
while I recognize the problems with over

480
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:50,230
planning this is a terrible terrible

481
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:52,120
message to send to kids I see this

482
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,339
movie's a 1:13 gag is here so a few

483
00:14:54,339 --> 00:14:55,810
dozen animators across the country can

484
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:56,529
jerk off now

485
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:58,510
I dress this what which where we gone

486
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:00,250
this Joyride doesn't end with 20 people

487
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,290
and numerous species of fish dead all

488
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:04,000
these fish switched tanks which is

489
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,500
definitely hilarious but none of them

490
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,240
fall or break this truck jumps to

491
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,890
concrete highway barriers and keeps

492
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:11,290
going that's bull then the goddamn fish

493
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:13,450
tanks inside again go unscathed it's

494
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:14,829
like this movie was made just to test my

495
00:15:14,829 --> 00:15:19,380
patience and the movie is one seagulls

496
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,670
she goes off and fly in from the ocean

497
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,680
at least as often as they fly out to the

498
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,220
ocean

499
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:26,170
but hey you had a 50-50 chance and you

500
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:27,820
needed a lucky brick the cop responds to

501
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,920
a stolen truck is mesmerizingly fast and

502
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,940
despite the fact that they had no idea

503
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:31,930
where this truck was gone

504
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:33,250
they managed to set up a roadblock in

505
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,290
this direction sweet I enjoy this what a

506
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:36,820
wonderful world slow-motion shot as much

507
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,710
as the next guy but these doors were

508
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:40,480
locked from the outside damn it they did

509
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,490
not fall open during a free fall all

510
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:44,140
these fish miraculously missed the rock

511
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:46,029
on which these sea lions are perched you

512
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:48,459
can do what ever you put your mind to

513
00:15:48,459 --> 00:15:50,230
another terrible message to send to kids

514
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:52,810
because that's patently untrue if my kid

515
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:54,370
sees this movie and then puts his mind

516
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,750
to jumping off a building to fly

517
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,040
huh-huh-huh

518
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,740

water as far as the eye can see you fish

520
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,160

521
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,630

522
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,070
