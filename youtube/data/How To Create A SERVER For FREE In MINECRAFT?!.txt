minecraft server now what's pretty cool

20
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,109
is you can actually have your own domain

21
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:03,930
let's say you have to login the server

22
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,390
first and then there's so much you can

23
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,850
do like as you see right here here's all

24
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:10,710
the commands you have shops you have so

25
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,360
much different stuff and to get your own

26
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,159
domain once you log in it's just your

27
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,270
user name dot M Li or it'll be down all

28
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:19,439
that information will be down in the

29
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,000
description but you know walking around

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,960
this is fully our whole world we can

31
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,970
break anything we want we can do

32
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:29,310
whatever we want we can have friends

33
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:33,720
join our own world it's that awesome so

34
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,220
you know walk it around here you know

35
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,380
you can see it's just a randomly spawn

36
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,560
world and we can do whatever we please

37
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,020
we can build whatever we want we can

38
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,810
create minigames we can we can just do

39
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,820
what we want we can do what we want

40
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,820
you look like friends or you know people

41
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,590
I'm even thinking about building

42
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:55,710
something pretty cool on this world for

43
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:58,380
you guys that would be absolutely fun

44
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,719
and absolutely awesome so if you guys

45
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,000
want to know how to get / fly it's

46
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,799
pretty easy on the server I'm doing it

47
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,680
right now I am on the Vote page as you

48
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,470
can see and you get / fly you get a

49
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,569
thousand in-game money where you can buy

50
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:13,480
stuff at slow

51
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,019
- shop so that that's pretty cool itself

52
00:02:17,019 --> 00:02:18,610
you're probably gonna want some supplies

53
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:21,580
- you know actually build something cool

54
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,870
or you know you could just play vanilla

55
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,430
minecraft on the server it's all up to

56
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:26,500
you so we're going to go on each and

57
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,970
every single one and we're just going to

58
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,230
vote all we got to do is put our user

59
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:32,920
name in and then hit I'm not a robot I'm

60

not I'm not a robot guys I'm not a robe

61
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,930
and then we're gonna do the same thing

62
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:41,319
on the other you know websites until we

63
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:43,030
vote through all of them then right when

64
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,370
you get back into the game you will end

65
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:48,430
up having slash fly and a thousand

66
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,920
balance and your minecraft account which

67
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,660
is pretty cool for starting your own

68
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:55,030
server start in your own world it's

69
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:55,629
