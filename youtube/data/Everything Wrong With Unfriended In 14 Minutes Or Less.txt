[Music]

2
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:16,260
with the constant buffering of this logo

3
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,670
it's no surprise that this movie was

4
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,560
brought to us by Comcast also what

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,760
exactly is this supposed to be a ping

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,310
dial-up internet issues in 2014 this

7
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,050
warning notice seems way too complex

8
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,210
should just read warning live suicide

9
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,040
only dickhead should enter a level of

10
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,420
douchebaggery that would compel someone

11
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:31,830
to film this instead of attempting to

12
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:33,600
help might exist but I'm not willing to

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,129
deal with that thought so soon I shall

14
00:00:35,129 --> 00:00:37,050
lower suicide video can't decide how

15
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,850
long it actually is here it seems to be

16
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,070
159 but when we escape full screen

17
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,290
somehow the time has changed to 230 also

18
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:45,420
personal requests can we please not make

19
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,590
any more movies that start with

20
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,360
realistic first-person video of suicide

21
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,969
thanks Hollywood you're the best I'm not

22
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:52,530
gonna lie the idea of telling an entire

23
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:54,329
story just on a computer screen is

24
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:56,010
brilliant and the movie deserves credit

25
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,719
for having the balls to mostly follow it

26
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:59,670
through Plus this is the usual BS movie

27
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,200
software these are real sites and real

28
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,489
videos and while the videos have been

29
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:03,960
removed these links still actually work

30
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,090
to this day this video has 75 thousand

31
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:08,220
741 views and not a single one of those

32
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,869
viewers hit the subscribe link even

33
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:11,070
accidentally I'm not saying it's

34
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,360
impossible but go ahead and see if you

35
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,920
can find a video with more than 50,000

36
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,149
views and no subscribers

37
00:01:15,149 --> 00:01:19,049
I'll wait sound like a little oh no no

38
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:21,240
great just watching suicide videos I'm a

39
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,590
good friend it's just another day that

40
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,659
ends in Y you are now looking at the

41
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:27,689
outside of the human's right leg you

42
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:29,040
know he's just let me come over and show

43
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,720
you how it's done it sorry Mitch if you

44
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,220
want to go full cyber someday you'll

45
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:40,290
have to do the legwork first that was

46
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:41,670
the reaction Blair was looking for

47
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:42,329
really

48
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:43,829
I appreciated boobies all through high

49
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:45,479
school and it got me nowhere but add

50
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:47,189
some cheer rhyming to it and it somehow

51
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:49,259
works somehow Blair's own video gets all

52
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:50,700
hot and buffered even though we're

53
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,439
viewing her machines direct feet sure

54
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:53,880
maybe lowers the cause of this but

55
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,110
considering it'll happen throughout the

56
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,610
movie with no confusion on her part

57
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,500
here's an extra 20 sins for constant

58
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,610
self buffering which coincidentally

59
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:01,690
describes my entire adolescence

[Music]

61
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,520
what's goofy boast has to poltergeist

62
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,319
some miners like answering a group call

63
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:10,610
while boobs are about to be shown

64
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:11,959
instead of just killing everyone she

65
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:17,660
finds responsible for her death Ken

66
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,400
tries the always productive second stab

67
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,599
at a joke when the first one went

68
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:25,400
completely unacknowledged eases Christ

69
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,629
this movie should really just be called

70
00:02:26,629 --> 00:02:30,110
helpdesk ticket the movie but don't

71
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,610
actually say who's calling whom so we

72
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,110
can get some exciting Skype text between

73
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,580
Blair and Mitch I'm not saying the

74
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,079
structure of this film isn't clever but

75
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:37,280
just because you come up with a clever

76
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,599
idea doesn't mean it needs to be

77
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:40,610
realized into a white released film mmm

78
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,140
my owner Blair's got some Ray Parker jr.

79
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,099
in this library

80
00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:44,930
why is Blair asking Mitch this question

81
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:46,610
her previous screen clearly stated that

82
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:49,190
at 9:00 she added Jess Mitch Adam and

83
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,810
Ken to the conversation also she was

84
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:51,980
already in a conversation with Mitch

85
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,840
doing her striptease routine so why

86
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,280
would it say she added him along with

87
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,840
the other three come on newbie if you're

88
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,549
gonna Skype Skype right really Blair

89
00:02:58,549 --> 00:03:00,530
it's been two seconds he's not ghosting

90
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:01,940
you I know we're in a movie but give a

91
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,079
guy at least a full minute before you

92
00:03:03,079 --> 00:03:04,280
start going all overly attached

93
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,389
girlfriend on his ass how about I call

94
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:11,239
Blaire back and then we'll go from there

95
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:13,040
seriously we're doing another callback

96
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,630
this movie really needs to start on

97
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,130
fronting the most unbelievable part of

98
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:17,660
this movie is the ability of these kids

99
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,489
to type nearly flawlessly without using

100
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:20,150
autocorrect

101
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,620
I mean look Blair even used the correct

102
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,690
version of who's and ended a sentence

103
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:25,370
with the punctuation oh where did the

104
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:26,780
previous messages go she originally

105
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:27,980
responded that's not funny

106
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,420
and he said I'm serious now those are

107
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:30,709
gone so how am I supposed to know if it

108
00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:32,660
was funny or if he was serious and now

109
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:33,680
the message is back again

110
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,239
I get that the ghost of Laura Barnes is

111
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:36,380
messing with them but I'm pretty sure

112
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,819
this one has less to do with her and

113
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:38,810
more to do with the ghost of the

114
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:40,160
continuity department if today's the

115
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,840
one-year anniversary of Laura suicide

116
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,090
which we know happened April 12 2013

117
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,680
then this movie should be happening

118
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,139
Saturday April 12 2014 but Blair's

119
00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:50,030
computer says today is Monday so neither

120
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,470
her computer's broken or the filmmakers

121
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,609
don't think I know how to read a

122
00:03:52,609 --> 00:03:54,490
calendar

123
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:56,690
why can't we continue to hear the Skype

124
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:58,040
conversation that's obviously still

125
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,330
going on behind this window or whatever

126
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:00,860
the Mac version of a window is called

127
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,360
the professor probably actually killed

128
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,980
herself because none of her teaching was

129
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,210
getting through to anyone considering

130
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:06,590
whomever posted this couldn't even

131
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,810
capitalize the lead of the sentence no

132
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:10,100
one will be seated during Blair's

133
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,690
detailed reporting at a lower Barnes

134
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:13,580
account hacker also as interesting as

135
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,230
this concept is I'd be lying if I said

136
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,460
there aren't many moments of sheer

137
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,989
boredom as we watch someone simply

138
00:04:17,989 --> 00:04:19,340
navigate the internet if this has been a

139
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:20,630
short film maybe they could have cut out

140
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,070
a lot of the digital downtime which

141
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,780
still uses the mouse to select the copy

142
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,520
function if you weren't using command or

143
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,200
control C and V for all your cut and

144
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,790
paste needs you may actually deserve

145
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,980
what's coming to you in this movie troll

146
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:34,040
credit and now we can hear the Skype

147
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,750
conversation again sure it might be

148
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,980
distracting to listen to whatever was

149
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,690
going on in this teenage talk fest but

150
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:39,920
it's a little more distracting to have a

151
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,450
computer that randomly decides to play

152
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:42,950
audio only when it's convenient ooh the

153
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,020
plot

154
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,670
well Ken I don't like you and I really

155
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:47,840
don't understand how you joey fatone

156
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,640
your way into this group trashy little

157
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:54,230
bitch bleep damn it I think we've hit on

158
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:56,180
a new formula for the real world saves a

159
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:59,270
lot on production costs I guess and we

160
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,800
can go fight outside of a Wendy's or

161
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:07,850
something to be fair to Val all the

162
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,740
pictures are on justice page so it makes

163
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,390
perfect sense to assume she posted them

164
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,860
no one is aware there was a supernatural

165
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,930
presence at work yet you said it was

166
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:17,780
just a glitch hi

167
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,370
the teenage dialog in this movie makes

168
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:21,020
my soul to take sound like classic

169
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,640
Pinter probably just like a troll or

170
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,470
something a troll that has Laura's

171
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:26,720
actual account what is it troll this

172
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,100
question only makes me wish that there

173
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,690
were still people in 2018 that didn't

174
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:31,400
know what a troll is I have to sign with

175
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,080
Billy two to seven here there's already

176
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,060
been 250 scenes in less than 30 minutes

177
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,380
of them hanging up and calling everybody

178
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,270
back there's a third I'm gonna go all

179
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,070
unfriended up in this joint come over

180
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:42,530
Adam we'll go see Kyle we'll go across

181
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:44,960
the tracks across the tracks man this is

182
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,400
what you get when you rely too much on

183
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,050
an improper form it's Oh for the love of

184
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,850
jobs Skype throws up a pop-out window

185
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,350
when she navigates away this time

186
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,940
apparently Blaire just upgraded to the

187
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,290
version of Skype with the enhanced AI

188
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:58,120
integration for maximum dramatic tension

189
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,050
fortunately Ken would be excellent at

190
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:00,620
cinemasins

191
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,510
just send it to Ken so we can find out

192
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:04,610
who it is Kenda has been zero help with

193
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:06,320
the whole Billy to 2/7 thing he thought

194
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,220
it was a fucking glitch

195
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,360
why in the hell do they think he can

196
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,370
figure this out okay either I'm going

197
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,860
crazy or there's no forwarding button so

198
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,420
the ghost somehow eliminated Blair's

199
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,520
ability to forward in Gmail sure lore

200
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,140
has been grave hacking other things too

201
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,730
but the difference here is that this

202
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:21,500
hack exists only so that she has to

203
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,000
share her screen for the plots benefit

204
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,680
and for no other ghostly reason

205
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,640
shouldn't say that stuff and you

206
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,570
shouldn't forget that you never close

207
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:34,100
down screen share and he and everyone

208
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,690
can still see what you're doing except

209
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:36,710
the movie doesn't seem to care either

210
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:38,090
and considering it'll never come up

211
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:39,680
again why should any of us goddamnit

212
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,570
they're still on the Skype call like

213
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:44,030
Mitch is right in there just me asking

214
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:49,970
what's coming on Luby's idea of tension

215
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:51,620
and suspense is this scene I was more

216
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,240
afraid when Jeremy corner was waiting to

217
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,740
figure out if he'd keep a client when he

218
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:58,220
went solo the original tagline for this

219
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:04,010
movie 5250 actually Blair you're

220
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:06,200
highlighting 51 50 and honestly I'm

221
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,150
gonna go full 51 50 if we don't start

222
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:10,010
moving this along very soon also why is

223
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:11,990
care Blair even highlighting things as

224
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:13,100
she's reading them except for our

225
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,630
benefit at some point this whole thing

226
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,160
started to feel like a morbid PowerPoint

227
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:16,880
presentation

228
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,540
nobody except no one exactly maybe a

229
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,370
Mitch even if it's not a virus you know

230
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:23,840
it's not going to be anything good plus

231
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,250
if you leave it alone the movie would be

232
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,110
over so let's just finish this damn it

233
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:28,550
Blair as if I don't get frustrated

234
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,200
enough waiting for files to download in

235
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,610
real life now I'm going to movies to

236
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:32,720
watch it happen does this movie I'm an

237
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,790
uninstall feature also if you're skyping

238
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,380
with us many people this easily there is

239
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,030
no way one megabyte photo download

240
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:39,440
should take this long I actually don't

241
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,970
know since all these assholes are still

242
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,230
essentially nameless to me at this point

243
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,850
and I just assume they're all horrible

244
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:44,090
people

245
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:45,890
cyber saw we already know this is

246
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:47,240
supposed to be April 12 so why is all

247
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,650
Blair's recent email from mid-october

248
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:50,690
it's all of those in an empty recycling

249
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:52,640
bin okay pretty sure not okay just

250
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,840
couldn't even figure out how to delete

251
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,490
facebook photographs Claire didn't know

252
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:56,990
what a troll was this crew doesn't seem

253
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:58,070
like an effective group of children

254
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:04,310
virus detection launchers haha yes nice

255
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:06,020
work Ken no need to check on Val or

256
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,640
anything until we revel in your ability

257
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,200
to get this annoying user off our group

258
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,180
Skype ah-ha-ha damn when did Mitch

259
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:14,169
become Billy from scream all of a sudden

260
00:08:14,169 --> 00:08:16,910
what so Laura is somehow answering for

261
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:19,370
911 now with the real human voice she

262
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:20,840
moved from possessing laptops to

263
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,639
possessing random 9-1-1 operators will

264
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:23,930
any of these things even try to make

265
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:25,400
sense okay

266
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,860
can I guess Ken would say that can

267
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,330
conveniently getting up at the exact

268
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:32,510
moment is convenient why is the action

269
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,700
of Ken moving boxes so loud on Blairs

270
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,020
computer his computer is on the other

271
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,219
side of the room let's assume there's a

272
00:08:37,219 --> 00:08:38,419
headphone mic picking up some of the

273
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:40,250
noise it still wouldn't be that loud 30

274
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,169
seconds of Ken steering also I swear

275
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:43,729
this movie pauses in moments for so long

276
00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:44,779
that I sometimes wonder if the

277
00:08:44,779 --> 00:08:46,490
screenwriters brains are buffering so

278
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:48,830
does a medieval aura have the ability to

279
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:50,360
kick them offline why would she want to

280
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,520
exactly are her abilities and why wait

281
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,290
until the anniversary to do all this how

282
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:55,580
did she even know they would all be on a

283
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,140
group call on the suicide anniversary

284
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,700
why is this movie 25% people

285
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,350
disconnecting calls why did everyone

286
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:01,940
except for Blair wait for Ken to freak

287
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,350
out to appear on screen is Blair's

288
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,640
computer the only one that has a flair

289
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,830
for dramatic timing 47 minutes in and

290
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:08,420
I'm actually excited to see Ken's hand

291
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,680
and a blender since it means at least

292
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,720
something has been happened goddamnit

293
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,100
these are kids who have been raised with

294
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,990
mobile devices as their primary tool and

295
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:16,460
none of them are using it to do anything

296
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,650
after that call text call use the

297
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:20,029
flashlight the movie wants to use that

298
00:09:20,029 --> 00:09:21,950
9-1-1 fake out from a few moments ago

299
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,720
was an out to eliminate the phones and

300
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,730
I'm not buying it especially after they

301
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:27,470
know for a fact that someone died there

302
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:28,610
was no group of teens that wouldn't be

303
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:29,779
trying to reach out to all sorts of

304
00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:31,370
people as this was happening even after

305
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:35,660
a weird 9-1-1 call yeah well if there's

306
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,220
no one there then what exactly are you

307
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,170
checking out also are no one's parents

308
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:40,580
at home sure Blaire and Mitch's dad's

309
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,020
are up drinking together but there are

310
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:49,400
no other mothers in this universe when

311
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,320
Blair selects the force quit tab and the

312
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,850
video doesn't disappear immediately why

313
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:54,620
does the sound clearly shows in the

314
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,970
front youtube video that the sound has

315
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,620
not been muted why do these two videos

316
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,240
that look to be in the exact same spot

317
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,070
show time codes that are eight seconds

318
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:02,900
apart also it's pretty fitting that in

319
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,459
the end this movie's inciting incident

320
00:10:04,459 --> 00:10:06,890
is literally Jesus I know teens could be

321
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:08,450
assholes but suggesting someone should

322
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:10,220
kill themselves over themselves well

323
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,959
passed out drunk is this the same school

324
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:14,180
from wrinkle and time also if all these

325
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,740
messages were being sent then why was

326
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,390
Val criticized so much earlier in the

327
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:19,070
movie for the email suggesting Laura do

328
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,900
the exact same thing is Blair actually

329
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,760
trying to get information from a pink

330
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,740
don't talk to dead people reddit also

331
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,330
apparently this sentence construction

332
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:28,100
has also been possessed somebody just

333
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,750
tell me how to play thunder you

334
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,149
my fingers and then if you've done

335
00:10:33,149 --> 00:10:34,800
something you have to put your finger

336
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,569
now actually that's just one way to play

337
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:37,980
never have I ever you can also drink

338
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,839
every time you've done the D or remove

339
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,399
an item of clothing since Billy two to

340
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:43,079
seven is giving no directions then let's

341
00:10:43,079 --> 00:10:44,550
hope Jessa's version is the one she

342
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,990
wants them to play or they're all dead

343
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:49,379
why are you why but Blair just confessed

344
00:10:49,379 --> 00:10:52,290
to posting about Laura and that they

345
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:54,149
were all doing it so why don't they just

346
00:10:54,149 --> 00:10:54,930
come clean now

347
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:59,040
don't they all know what they did based

348
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,689
on the previous 55 minutes of this film

349
00:11:00,689 --> 00:11:02,160
pretty sure that would have only been

350
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,899
one of many reasons Adams dad should

351
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:09,269
disown it this little game I've never

352
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:10,860
have I ever is bringing up some sore

353
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,750
spots among these four but doesn't that

354
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,639
seem a bit strange to start turning on

355
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:16,319
one another when this kind of weird is

356
00:11:16,319 --> 00:11:19,560
going down I'm signing with Blair here

357
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,000
she's the one person who has done

358
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,800
nothing to Adam during this game why

359
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:28,980
didn't he go after Jess or Mitch - Blair

360
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,810
just assumed mitch is seeing this - no

361
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:32,069
one else is complained about their

362
00:11:32,069 --> 00:11:33,480
screens getting hijacked and he didn't

363
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,399
say a thing about it also who even took

364
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:36,029
this video

365
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,470
where was it stored and how did it get

366
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:39,629
uploaded so fast did Laura work as part

367
00:11:39,629 --> 00:11:41,459
of the Geek Squad before she died also

368
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:42,959
also why are every one of these videos

369
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,240
edited damn I guess they just let any

370
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,160
kind of smut on YouTube these days those

371
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:56,189
unscrupulous bastards but why has a

372
00:11:56,189 --> 00:11:58,290
Billy 2 to 7 killed any of them yet they

373
00:11:58,290 --> 00:11:59,879
keep taking their hands down and how

374
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:00,839
would any of them remember how many

375
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:02,279
fingers they should still have up in all

376
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:03,990
this confusion it's calm down okay just

377
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,459
a quick reminder it's been 15 minutes

378
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:06,839
since these members of the teenage

379
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:08,730
wasteland saw a friend die and still

380
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:10,230
none of them have even thought to use

381
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,939
their readily available phones for any

382
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:15,779
purpose whatsoever how about not show

383
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:17,069
with a paper that gets one of your good

384
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,899
friends killed I mean I've never been in

385
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:20,399
a situation where me and four of my

386
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,019
friends were held hostage by a ghost

387
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:23,879
that has a fondness for finger pants but

388
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:25,110
I'm pretty sure I would do the exact

389
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:26,430
opposite of everything these dumbasses

390
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:28,949
have done so far also what the hell this

391
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:30,689
pop-up ad feels so out of place here

392
00:12:30,689 --> 00:12:32,009
that I'm wondering if it's only meant to

393
00:12:32,009 --> 00:12:33,209
cover up something in the background

394
00:12:33,209 --> 00:12:34,829
they didn't like and yes I do realize

395
00:12:34,829 --> 00:12:36,420
there's a bit of Blair unbuttoning or

396
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,129
sure taniad but I still feel like the

397
00:12:38,129 --> 00:12:40,470
tone is way off you're in a life or

398
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:42,120
death situation friends are dying and

399
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,290
you have your phone nearby and you're

400
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:43,740
opening

401
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,240
Roulet to save the day do you want

402
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,440
penises player because that's how you

403
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,940
get penises the ghost in the machine has

404
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,920
shown the ability to impact any area of

405
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,720
these computers that she wants so why is

406
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,770
she leaving this chat completely

407
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:59,730
unaffected dear god this constant signal

408
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:01,470
degrade effect is annoying I know it's

409
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:02,730
supposed to be scary but it's more

410
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:04,020
likely that's just meant as a way to

411
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,730
hide necessary cuts either way

412
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:07,350
eventually I'd like to actually see or

413
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:09,780
hear what's going on okay does your

414
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:11,130
phone not have a flashlight

415
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:12,600
why is everyone continuing to ignore the

416
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,230
best tool in the toolbox time and place

417
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:20,340
player time and place if Laura has been

418
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,540
possessing everyone else to kill

419
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,190
themselves why is she all the sudden

420
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:24,630
physically manifesting to kill Blair

421
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:26,520
also isn't this movie a hundred times

422
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,020
better if it sticks to its guns and

423
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,490
takes place entirely on the computer

424
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:30,930
screen and maybe ends with an empty

425
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:32,610
skype room or maybe Laura deleting files

426
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:34,170
and covering her tracks you got the ball

427
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:35,670
of the one-yard line movie why fumble

428
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:46,370
now

429
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:51,360
get the knife what the knife you have

430
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,800
part of my attention you have the

431
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,010
minimum amount hello do you wanna play

432
00:13:56,010 --> 00:14:04,380

433
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:07,000
oh hello
