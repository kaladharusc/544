1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,319
hello everybody my name is markiplier

2
00:00:01,319 --> 00:00:03,149
and welcome back to Red Dead Redemption

3
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:06,919
- now this is the episode where I go

4
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:09,630
hunting and I ain't gonna hunt around it

5
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:11,160
the first place that I need to go is

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,620
apparently right here because in this

7
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,369
general area there is what is known as

8
00:00:16,369 --> 00:00:19,680
the trapper and the trapper is what I've

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,330
been looking for this entire time the

10
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,250
guy that's gonna help me get the recipes

11
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,039
that I need to be able to make what I

12
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:27,960
want to make and that may include a

13
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,539
certain possum at now I don't know if

14
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:31,529
I'm gonna be able to do that but I'm

15
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:33,510
gonna go all the way over there and I'm

16
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:37,920
going to kill every animal I see my god

17
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,800
it is foggy out here also I feel like I

18
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:49,289
have to sneeze okay thank you okay I'm

19
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:51,690
better now I think no no I bet I've been

20
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:53,489
having this constant feeling that I

21
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:54,870
needed to sneeze for a while and that

22
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:56,820
finally paid off in dividends I think

23
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,850
it's the fogginess of this area so we're

24
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:01,590
you having entered legendary animal

25
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,030
territory but it will take some time

26
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,960
before the animal returns to the area oh

27
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,549
because I didn't do it as the it's a

28
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:10,049
legendary Fox but whatever it don't

29
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:12,479
matter it don't matter it don't matter

30
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,500
ooh hello you okay there we are

31
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,229

32
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:20,430

34
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:28,170

35
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,420
lovely lovely lovely lovely lovely

36
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,049
environment and talk about some stuff

37
00:01:33,049 --> 00:01:37,409
and we want to talk about yeah oh so a

38
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:39,240
while back I was talking about my trip

39
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,640
to Korea how I realized it I I have a

40
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,229
lot of stories from Korea but I never

41
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:45,090
really got around telling him I always

42
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,500
thought that I would find a place to do

43
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,820
it when I'm in a game but I always ends

44
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,950
up being like god dammit this XYZ

45
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,899
happens and I can't do nothing about it

46
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:55,409
but now I can so it's nice and one of

47
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:57,689
the one of the greatest things about my

48
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:00,990
trip to Korea was just the ability to

49
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,060
appreciate this part of me that I've

50
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,460
never really embraced before and I've

51
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,530
said that before but like it really

52
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:09,039
really really met

53
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:12,430
meant a lot to me this is because like I

54
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,230
am half Korean for those of you who

55
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:16,510
still don't know somehow I am half

56
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:19,599
Korean yes and when I was growing up as

57
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,189
a kid you know I didn't really get a

58
00:02:21,189 --> 00:02:24,549
chance to embrace any of that it wasn't

59
00:02:24,549 --> 00:02:26,439
just a part of my child it wasn't any

60
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:29,680
any sort of that you know as a kid

61
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,930
growing up in a small town called

62
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:36,310
Milford in the middle of Ohio you don't

63
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:38,290
get a lot of reinforcement about your

64
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:40,299
cultural heritage so it ends up you just

65
00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:42,489
kind of do whatever you can to not stand

66
00:02:42,489 --> 00:02:44,200
out nearly as much and kind of fit in

67
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:49,109
where you can sorry didn't mean that

68
00:02:49,109 --> 00:02:52,450
yeesh okay well I got one

69
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:56,560
I kinda anyway kind of beat up a little

70
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,109
bit but that's alright yeah so but when

71
00:02:59,109 --> 00:03:01,329
I went to Korea like one of the things

72
00:03:01,329 --> 00:03:03,129
that I really noticed isn't so much that

73
00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:06,250
like I I didn't really identify with all

74
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:09,519
of the it's not like that I super

75
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:10,870
identified with the culture or anything

76
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,370
like that because it's super hard to say

77
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:15,129
that and do that when this is the first

78
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:16,120
time I've gone over there for

79
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,709
appreciating it but what I did realize

80
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:20,859
is that I could I felt like I could I

81
00:03:20,859 --> 00:03:22,599
felt like it could really be a part of

82
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:24,609
it and I felt like I wanted to where as

83
00:03:24,609 --> 00:03:26,260
I was starting to learn Korean just to

84
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,699
try to learn Korean for the sake of

85
00:03:27,699 --> 00:03:29,949
speaking with my family I want to now

86
00:03:29,949 --> 00:03:32,229
learn Korean for the sake of kind of

87
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:34,389
living in Korea and one of the best ways

88
00:03:34,389 --> 00:03:35,799
that I could possibly do that is by

89
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,419
going over to Korea and living there for

90
00:03:37,419 --> 00:03:44,620
at least a little bit of time hello okay

because that's amazing but at the same

134
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:10,030
time I already have a mission for this

135
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:12,610
and it's hunting down different animals

136
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:12,950
and

137
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,750
I have a funny feeling you wouldn't be

138
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,880
appreciative if I murdered all your

139
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,920
animals so I'm not gonna do that

140
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:28,490
hello hi there hello what again again

141
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,270
again

142
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:32,120
what the heck in heck what the heck in a

143
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,590
queue just let's go I think my

144
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:34,910
controller might be broken because I've

145
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:37,190
dropped it and probably thrown it at

146
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:39,500
some juncture or another hey can you

147
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:46,730
come back here come on now no don't let

148
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:51,770
go don't let go man you could impale me

149
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:56,570
real easily with those okay yeah so was

150
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:59,000
I talking about oh yeah so I feel like I

151
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,810
could really go to Korea like go there

152
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:05,360
enjoy the land enjoy everything about

153
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,790
Korea really learn the language and

154
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:09,590
immerse myself in the experience of it

155
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:12,200
like if I live there for about two

156
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,540
months I figure that's what I want like

157
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,610
you know and I don't know exactly how

158
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:19,310
I'm gonna work for it but uh you know I

159
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,650
say that but obviously it would be a lot

160
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:24,080
easier for me to do then pretty much

161
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,880
anything I could just go there I have

162
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,590
family there that would take care of me

163
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:29,690
and I could stay with them or I kind of

164
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:30,920
want to live on my own just to see like

165
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,350
would be like to live in Seoul and I

166
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:34,850
know the whole renting system is weird

167
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:37,160
over there so I got to deal with that I

168
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,440
think I can only care one of those maybe

169
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:45,710
yeah I'm gonna see it again gee I've

170
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:48,710
been so I've been so like I don't know

171
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:51,440
I've been so in my own bubble as far as

172
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,420
living on YouTube I think this is like

173
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,340
personal stuff like I've been in so in

174
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,110
my own bubble and I sometimes forget

175
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,980
that I can just do whatever I want like

176
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,230
whenever I can

177
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:05,630
okay what was that city is asked for a

178
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:08,590
harmonica oh oh

179
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:12,470
even know that yeah so like I could I

180
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:14,000
could go like I could leave well I got

181
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,360
tour I got tour but like if I had some

182
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,970
free time I could just like go find a

183
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:22,610
flight same day go out there bring some

184
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:25,170
recording equipment and make some

185
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:27,570
make some videos while I'm there can you

186
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:31,770
get over you looked there we go can you

187
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:33,870
get over a little closer please a little

188
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:36,900
closer yeah family that's besides the

189
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,340
point the logistics of it aren't exactly

190
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,200
what I was talking about but yeah I just

191
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,660
I really like the culture of it I really

192
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,280
feel like I could be part of it but then

193
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,080
again I've also got the option the funny

194
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,510
option that in LA there's this place

195
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:50,070
called Koreatown and you can

196
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:54,000
legitimately just oh yeah you can't do

197
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,390
it okay well forget this how do I drop

198
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:59,310
you yeah you can only do one of those at

199
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:00,600
a time but an unlimited number of

200
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,900
pellets so I could I could just like go

201
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,610
to Koreatown everyday and just kind of

202
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:08,430
hang out there which could be fun yeah

203
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:10,410
but at the same time I'm not sure if it

204
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:11,910
would be entirely the same experience

205
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:14,700
but I mean Koreatown is I miss Koreatown

206
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,280
so you wouldn't be too far off from the

207
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:23,120
general experience of it again again

208
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,430
okay why cuz it automatically hops off

209
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:27,840
the horse one that does it so it's not

210
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,220
like I have a choice it just gets too

211
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:32,300
far away and then suddenly it's gone I

212
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,530
will join you but I don't want to take

213
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:37,230
my weight off in that weird way that you

214
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:39,300
suggested me to there's a lot of options

215
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,010
that I can do and it's it's all it's all

216
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:43,440
leading into like what I want to do in

217
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,570
the next decade of my life because next

218
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:47,220
year I'm gonna be 30 years old I'm gonna

219
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,590
hit the big 3-0 and I kind of wonder

220
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,570
like what am I to be doing after that I

221
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:53,400
know it's not in any way shape or form

222
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:57,210
old but it will feel old like her I'm 29

223
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:00,050
I already feel old Bonin comes down to

224
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:02,370
it comes down to living like the next

225
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:03,930
decade of my life I really do wonder

226
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:05,910
like how is it gonna shape up what one

227
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,590
of my pursuits gonna be like what am I

228
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:09,120
gonna what I got what am I gonna be

229
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,980
focusing on and I'm gonna be focusing on

230
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,320
like trying to improve the videos that I

231
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,610
make cuz I'm probably gonna be doing

232
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,350
YouTube for the next few years at least

233
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:19,020
in one shape or another and just like

234
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,700
what's that gonna be like do I want to

235
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,830
go and make some movies which I could do

236
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,680
like see how that goes do I want to try

237
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,620
to start a business of some sort like

238
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,030
what am I gonna be doing to my 30s

239
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,310
because my 20s are largely defined by

240
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:34,320
what I did on YouTube I started my

241
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,090
youtube channel when I was 20 to eat

242
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:38,520
just before I turned 22 years old like

243
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:41,279
23 years old so I was like 2 months away

244
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,920
from 23 years old I started my channel

245
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,360
so from 23 to 30 was all that I do and

246
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,980
all that you see right now and then I

247
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,890
know what's what's 30 to 40 gonna be

248
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:55,290
like what am I gonna be like when I'm 40

249
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:57,839
yeah I can't even imagine that I mean I

250
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:58,920
have a pretty good idea of what I'm

251
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,750
gonna be like when I'm 30 at least I'm

252
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,640
gonna be moderately healthier cuz I've

253
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,500
started running lately and for some

254
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,120
reason I never thought that I would but

255
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,700
I like running I just enjoy it it's

256
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,980
something that I can actually get behind

257
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:12,630
so I feel healthier and I feel like I'm

258
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,060
actually getting in shape I feel excited

259
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,740
when I get ready to run and even after

260
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,720
I'm done running I'm like oh boy I wish

261
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,670
I could run some more which is an

262
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:21,959
experience that I never thought I'd ever

263
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:23,850
have but I'm not worried about my health

264
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,260
I'm not worried about all that I've had

265
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,180
enough healthy peers in my 20s I'm sure

266
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,640
I'll have more health care soon but yeah

267
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,140
it's just like what am I gonna do

268
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,180
purpose wise because a lot of what I do

269
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,190
on YouTube is very purpose-driven I feel

270
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:38,010
I feel like a lot of what I've done and

271
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:39,420
what we've done is the community has

272
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,130
accomplished a lot in terms of helping

273
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:42,390
people and spreading a lot of goodwill

274
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:44,610
and I wonder if it's gonna carry on in

275
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:47,250
the same way that it's been done or if

276
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,740
there's gonna be some new form that I'll

277
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,050
have to explore you know what I mean I

278
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:53,670
don't know where it's gonna lead and I

279
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:55,560
don't know how I'm gonna get there but I

280
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,970
know that I'm gonna keep working at it

281
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:59,790
and all I can do is be curious about it

282
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:02,550
yeah oh wait that's the trapper that is

283

when it told me hit the button but was

372
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:14,530
like these are these are mechanics that

373
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:17,200
I've never seen before so wouldn't no

374

from the rich oh hey art a Parsi who is

380
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:34,960
this some stuff okay I don't know what

381
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:40,780
this is but I got some of it oregano all

382
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:41,919
right let's keep going what was I

383
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:42,370
talking about

384
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:45,669
oh yeah if you think about like from 23

385
00:18:45,669 --> 00:18:50,500
to now like the YouTube channel has been

386
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,940
my big project

387
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,650
whereas everything inside the channel

388
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:55,000
has been smaller projects different

389
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,919
things that I do but the overarching

390
00:18:56,919 --> 00:19:00,549
theme of my 20s is that I made a YouTube

391
00:19:00,549 --> 00:19:02,760
deal like that is the overarching theme

392
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,200
so I'm like wondering like what is the

393
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,030
next 10 years ago my life gonna be I

394
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:09,250
know thankfully like thankfully I I know

395
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,530
thankfully that um like I'm probably

396
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:14,470
gonna be able to have the freedom to do

397
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:16,179
whatever I want which is not something

398
00:19:16,179 --> 00:19:18,010
that everybody can say and I know that

399
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:20,380
I know that I should never take that for

400
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,990
granted because I never will and I never

401
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:24,760
want to forget like the people that

402
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,380
helped me along the way like the friends

403
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,760
that were there for me and you guys who

404
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,740
supported me the entire time that's

405
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,030
something that I can never forget but I

406
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:33,310
also wonder like what what next thing am

407
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:36,520
I gonna try to make myself improve that

408
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,050
what what next thing am I gonna try to

409
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:39,970
build myself up about what next thing am

410
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,760
I gonna conquer like what am I gonna do

411
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,520
cuz me as a person I'm very much defined

412
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,990
by the goals that I put in front of me

413
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:50,350
I'm very much built up by like the

414
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:51,940
challenges that I see on the horizon

415
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:55,450
very much like encouraged by the next

416
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:57,100
thing that I could possibly do and I

417
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:00,990
always look at it like that really cool

418
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:04,410
yeah and so when it comes down to

419
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:07,210
hopefully having something more down the

420
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:08,860
road I would only want to do that if it

421
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,990
was fulfilling it was challenging and it

422
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:12,730
really pushed me as an individual and it

423
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:16,270
made me take risks because it being

424
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:17,650
where I am and all the success that I

425
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,570
have like on the counter side of that is

426
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:21,400
like all having all that success makes

427
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,590
it very difficult to push myself in a

428
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:32,380
way that makes me risk everything I'd

429
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,780
like to talk to you about your Wild West

430

00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:10,690
well what was that what the hell just

486
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:13,049
happened all right then

487
00:25:13,049 --> 00:25:15,669
man they're just gonna introduce a

488
00:25:15,669 --> 00:25:18,460
character that cool and just she's gone

489
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:21,399
like just like that that is outrageous I

490
00:25:21,399 --> 00:25:24,580
can't believe that that is so cool I

491
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:27,220
hope we see her again I really always

492
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:29,169
hear again because that was amazing

493
00:25:29,169 --> 00:25:33,190
oh oh oh God

494
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:38,019
Oh oh god oh god oh he is in the mark

495
00:25:38,019 --> 00:25:39,700
all right you know what I don't feel too

496
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,200
good about looting these buys mostly

497
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,330
because they're horrible and covered him

498
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:47,740
and the many types of shit okay anyway

499
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:51,600
back to waxing philosophical about my

500
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,879
cuz um like I've talked about before I

501
00:25:54,879 --> 00:26:01,409
don't think that I'm gonna be doing

502
00:26:01,409 --> 00:26:14,200
fried just damn it I was chips trying to

503
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:27,070

508
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:45,909
probably gonna be playing video games in

509
00:26:45,909 --> 00:26:48,190
one way or another until the day I die

510
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:51,490
like video games are an integral part of

511
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:54,070
my life but I also don't know if I'm

512
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:56,139
gonna be doing Let's Plays until dad

513
00:26:56,139 --> 00:26:59,049
like who knows what kind of content

514
00:26:59,049 --> 00:27:01,330
people will be making or watching like

515
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:04,210
in the next 10 years and just to just to

516
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:07,539
like be all like I'm old like just

517
00:27:07,539 --> 00:27:09,730
looking at the technological

518
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:12,070
advancements of the last 10 years alone

519
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:12,570
that

520
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:14,909
like living just seeing how far things

521
00:27:14,909 --> 00:27:16,860
have come from that like this cell phone

522
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:19,529
era that only started in oh seven it's

523
00:27:19,529 --> 00:27:22,259
2018 that was just over ten years ago

524
00:27:22,259 --> 00:27:24,120
now not the self of the smartphone era

525
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,220
it's like seeing how that's happening

526
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,769
now that's like move forward and I can't

527
00:27:28,769 --> 00:27:29,880
imagine what kind of technological

528
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,159
progress we're gonna make in the next

529
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:34,590

534
00:27:44,009 --> 00:27:45,539
people gonna see like am I even gonna

535
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:47,250

536
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:49,259
adapt to it am I am I gonna like be set

537
00:27:49,259 --> 00:27:51,240
in my ways and be like it was better

538
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,159
back in my day when you had to make a

539
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:54,990
let's play with it with a screen

540
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:56,519
recorder and a camera we didn't have

541
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:58,620
this beam casting directly into their

542
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:01,139
eyeballs nonsense people weren't virtual

543
00:28:01,139 --> 00:28:03,330
reality seing inside my recording room

544
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:05,580
we were in all on a couch together it's

545
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,320
bullshit but I know that I'm gonna keep

546
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:10,620
changing because for me life is change

547
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,659
you always change you always got to

548
00:28:12,659 --> 00:28:14,519
change if you stay the same you're never

549
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:16,350
gonna get anywhere in life and like

550
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:17,759
everyone that wants to hold on to

551
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:19,679
something it never made sense to me that

552
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:22,080
whole mind said that you could stay the

553
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,149
same and you keep things controlled and

554
00:28:24,149 --> 00:28:26,009
you hold on to what you have never made

555
00:28:26,009 --> 00:28:26,639
sense to me

556
00:28:26,639 --> 00:28:28,320
that's why I've always said you know I

557
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,940
didn't care if my channel died tomorrow

558
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,590
it's not that I didn't care about a

559
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:34,590
channel it's that you know if it does

560
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:38,370
I'm ready to move on if it does die or

561
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:40,740
if for some reason it does go away I am

562
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,419
ready to move on to something new

563
00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:45,090
because I like the idea of the challenge

564
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:48,389
I like the idea of seeing what else I

565
00:28:48,389 --> 00:28:50,850
can do of being forced into a

566
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:52,950
circumstance where I have to change and

567
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:54,450
I have to adapt and I have to do

568
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:56,789
something new and I have to see what

569
00:28:56,789 --> 00:28:58,110
life is gonna throw at me and I have to

570
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,730
roll with it or else I'm just gonna end

571
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:03,299
up being rolled over like that's that's

572
00:29:03,299 --> 00:29:05,879
the only real set rule there is is that

573
00:29:05,879 --> 00:29:08,190
there will be change you have to adapt

574
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:11,340
or you die that's been the rule of life

575
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:13,980
since the beginning of it so yeah why

576
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,120
should I try to make it any different

577
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,549
and technology is just gonna make it

578
00:29:17,549 --> 00:29:18,930
wildly different

579
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:20,280
I think that's that's definitely gonna

580
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,630
be something that's gonna be ingrained

581
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:23,730
in whatever I do next the the deep

582
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:26,280
appreciation of of technology and trying

583
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,410
to build something off of it and if I do

584
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:30,450
start a comedy or if I do do different

585
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:37,020
videos it'll be hello John John yeah if

586
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,670
it's me it'd be something to do with

587
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:40,830
technology because for me like

588
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:43,080
technology and advancing humanity and

589
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,000
making sure that humanity is always

590
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,520
moving forward like that system that's

591
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,290
just essential for me there there there

592
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:52,200
really is no other thing to do besides

593
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,720
that and making sure that mindset is

594
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,530
spread as far as implies the candy and

595
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:59,730
making sure that people's minds are

596
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:02,790
always pushing forward is essential all

597
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:05,610
right Bill Williamson what the hell you

598
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:07,080
going on about you've been trying to get

599
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,970
my attention for three goddamn episodes

600
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:11,040
now what do you want what do you want

601
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:18,510
bill the hell do you want been cooking

602
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:20,730
since horseshoe but you went kicked up

603
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:22,590
all that commotion at violent end

604
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:24,210
now we was preparing to rob the bank

605
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:26,220
there until you got involved and all

606
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:28,650
that nonsense and I don't know I just

607
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:30,420
feel like it's unfinished business that

608
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:32,850
wasn't my fault it was just one of them

609
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:35,310
things how come every time I get in

610
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:37,260
trouble I'm called a fool and an idiot

611
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:40,230
but when you get in trouble oh it's just

612
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:42,120
one of them things it's a good point

613
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:48,450
often yeah that's good point hit the

614
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:53,460
goddamn bank with us you really think

615
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,710
it's worth going back there four of us

616
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:57,990
can hit the bank easy but angle out of

617
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:01,080
you there will be loss we linger serious

618
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,600
no just local boys being rounded up and

619
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,240
pressed into action meaning if we go in

620
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,460
quick and quiet we can hit it just fine

621
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:12,240
if there's four of us I mean y'all think

622
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,120
it's worth the risk it's a bank Arthur

623
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:19,620
so is the take according to the fella I

624
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:22,050
met yes it's the end of the stock sales

625
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:24,240
plenty of money and plenty of people

626
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,980
milling about

627
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:31,110
all right now suppose it's worth taking

628
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:35,520
a look at least any case I need to

629
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,990

1131
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,090
on River Road through silt water

stranding ship okay I think I know a

1133
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:01,810
good spot to wait follow me why do you

1134
01:03:01,810 --> 01:03:04,180
talk like you're got a spasm in your

1135
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:07,810
diaphragm I wonder if like coz that

1136
01:03:07,810 --> 01:03:10,810
whole like transatlantic thing that's

1137
01:03:10,810 --> 01:03:13,930
not quite transatlantic but like I feel

1138
01:03:13,930 --> 01:03:16,600
like just people's desires to talk fancy

1139
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:20,110
I just came out of nothing I guess there

1140
01:03:20,110 --> 01:03:22,240
was trying to sounded distinct from one

1141
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:24,820
another somehow never works really just

1142
01:03:24,820 --> 01:03:26,350
sounded like a pompous douche most of

1143
01:03:26,350 --> 01:03:27,760
the time no matter what way you tried to

1144
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:29,500
do it that's why I'm proud to have a

1145
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:30,940
Cincinnati an accent

1146
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:34,650
the most basic and non special accent

1147
01:03:34,650 --> 01:04:29,080
that's okay Oh God why would he say that

1148
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:31,270
unless something went wrong something's

1149
01:04:31,270 --> 01:04:34,660
gonna go wrong we man of distinction who

1150
01:04:34,660 --> 01:04:39,070
are discouraged it's gonna go wrong here

1151
01:04:39,070 --> 01:04:42,960
we are all right if you say so

1152
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:58,240
nice spot my good okay they're safe

1153
01:04:58,240 --> 01:04:58,930
sorry

1154
01:04:58,930 --> 01:05:01,870
what we think well according to this the

1155
01:05:01,870 --> 01:05:04,120
loot is located in a strongbox which is

1156
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:06,109
in the back I'll put on a little

1157
01:05:06,109 --> 01:05:08,839
formants and you can scurry around open

1158
01:05:08,839 --> 01:05:10,789
the strongbox and relieve them of the

1159
01:05:10,789 --> 01:05:12,890
goodies how do i open the strongbox

1160
01:05:12,890 --> 01:05:15,349
without threatening someone to open it

1161
01:05:15,349 --> 01:05:20,539
for me this should work I'm hoping

1162
01:05:20,539 --> 01:05:23,210
complete silence won't be necessary

1163
01:05:23,210 --> 01:05:24,410

[Laughter]

1211
01:10:41,150 --> 01:10:48,360
fishing on my map but we gotta go

1212
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:52,770
and because it's last mission

1213
01:10:52,770 --> 01:10:55,830
so we're heading in Hosea

1214
01:10:55,830 --> 01:10:57,929
oh yeah the brick water the breakwall

1215
01:10:57,929 --> 01:11:22,980
the bravely the Brit wave okay I gotta

1216
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:25,440
stop do with that so we're gonna make

1217
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:27,119
our way over to the great wave this

1218
01:11:27,119 --> 01:11:29,969
place meet with Hosea and then we're

1219
01:11:29,969 --> 01:11:32,489
gonna finish off probably the dynamics

1220
01:11:32,489 --> 01:11:34,949
between the two feuding families that's

1221
01:11:34,949 --> 01:11:37,020
what I would guess that this particular

1222
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:39,599
adventure is gonna do now I don't know

1223
01:11:39,599 --> 01:11:42,239
if I'm welcome on this place but I think

1224
01:11:42,239 --> 01:11:44,280
I am I think we left on good terms even

1225
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:46,380
though I stole their horses whose

1226
01:11:46,380 --> 01:11:48,630
mysterious group of people stole our

1227
01:11:48,630 --> 01:11:51,210
horses looked a lot like you but he had

1228
01:11:51,210 --> 01:11:52,830
a mask on there's no way I could

1229
01:11:52,830 --> 01:11:54,570
possibly tell if it was actually you

1230
01:11:54,570 --> 01:12:01,760
also I want to see Hosea really really

1231
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:05,520
what we didn't even hit anything that

1232
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:07,739
time this seems like this games trying

1233
01:12:07,739 --> 01:12:09,389
to play the joke too hard I ain't gonna

1234
01:12:09,389 --> 01:12:10,349

intelligence as a matter of some

1251
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:00,810
conjecture some say he is as dumb as he

suspect that maybe something's going on

1495
01:30:10,640 --> 01:30:13,080
maybe something a little bit problematic

1496
