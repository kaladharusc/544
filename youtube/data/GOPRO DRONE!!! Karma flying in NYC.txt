1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
yeah

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,890
that's via that's the GoPro common play right there

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,700
ok referred through some real test now

4
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,230
everybody

5
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:27,519
here

6
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:33,100
today's entire episode is going to be about gear to his friends first day at

7
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:33,940
school by herself

8
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:37,930
oh my god gear haven't talked about gear in awhile this entire episode you can be

9
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:42,190
focused on gear if you're an interesting camera gear come back tomorrow for our

10
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:46,420
regularly scheduled programming that my thesis on gear is pretty straightforward

11
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:50,559
I've shared it with you a million times i always want the very best image

12
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:53,980
possible so long as it doesn't get in the way of me living my life

13
00:00:54,519 --> 00:00:58,089
we're doing my thing now what that literally means is like this like when I

14
00:00:58,089 --> 00:01:02,650
walk into I walk into an airplane and I'm carrying my big blogging camera

15
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:03,790
which looks like this

16
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:06,850
the flight attendant says hey you can't have that there's no filming in here it

17
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:10,630
gets in the way when I walk onto an airplane holding this so this is the

18
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:13,570
thing they just assume that I'm a nerd who has two talking to a camera in there

19
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:17,350
are other places we just can't bring a camera into I just use my cell phone

20
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:20,590
that's what i mean by the best image possible as long as it doesn't get in

21
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:27,280
the way the gist of this whole thesis is that this five-thousand-dollar camera is

22
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:33,070
often not as good as this $1,500 camera this $59 camera is often not as cute as

23
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:37,930
500 our camera less good than this 200 our camera and this tune our camera at

24
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:41,380
time is not as good as the camera on my cell phone

25
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:46,060
you see when the story is king and the story is always King these things just

26
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:52,030
serve this story and whatever one of these can tell your story the best is

27
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:57,220
the best camera now I've said all this before why am i repeating myself today

28
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:03,280
today is a very special day today is well in the world of drones about if

29
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,510
you're a longtime viewers of this show you know how conflicted my relationship

30
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:10,510
has been with drones

31
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:19,120
i still use this like toy drone because of its convenience this was the only one

32
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,510
that fit into my backpack equip the image quality on that thing is like a

33
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:26,170
bad cell phone camera but this thing has been amazing

34
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:29,410
it produces incredible results it looks like we've got a helicopter following me

35
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:29,950
around

36
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:34,480
it's not super manageable in fact this is a regular backpack and this is the

37
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:41,500
pack that's meant to carry the Phantom for its kind of the only way to keep but

38
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:45,700
it's like the only way to keep it safe now going back to where I started about

39
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:49,840
having the gear get in the way of you telling your story i gave up on keeping

40
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,930
that thing safe and I just take the propellers off and cream and my normal

41
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:59,920
size backpack that is in part the reason why i have 127 broken ones

42
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,879
what is the best answer to like the camera conundrum

43
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:08,500
but with drones I don't know and I don't know if it's been answered yet but today

44
00:03:09,069 --> 00:03:13,239
gopro announced their new drone and maybe that's it

45
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:17,620
Oh what can it be

46
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:29,220
yeah

47
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:35,710
so much more than a drug now i happen to have one right here so I thought we'd

48
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:40,300
take a look just as a disclaimer this is not a commercial for or was paid for by

49
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:45,430
or is an endorsement of anything for gopro they just gave me the opportunity

50
00:03:45,430 --> 00:04:06,580
to check out this early prototype so this this is the actual drone itself

51
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:18,940
this here this is the battery fully charged battery into drone feels pretty

52
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:28,660
good now the magic the drone wings actually just flip out on this so this

53
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,000
big guy

54
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,200
collapse it down to something far more manageable even with the propellers on

55
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,860
there something big here that's different is the fact that instead of

56
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:45,700
having a set of having a fixed camera is actually this is a GoPro on the front

57
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:49,840
now I don't know what that better or if that's worse because i haven't flown

58
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:57,820
this sucker yet but no just for a quick size size comparison you can see here

59
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:04,419
the manageability is favors the GoPro in a big way because the cameras on the

60
00:05:04,419 --> 00:05:08,230
front here it means the legs could actually be smaller and pulled out in

61
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:11,740
the bottom because they're not responsible for protecting the camera

62
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:16,419
like here all right and this is the gimbal here this is what keeps the image

63
00:05:16,419 --> 00:05:24,790
totally steady symbol here gimbal here but this is what GoPro did that's

64
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:30,370
totally next level ready the gimbal actually ok you turn this like this and

65
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:35,950
then just slide it out the gimbals pops out you take this little guy

66
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:44,210
and then you've got a handheld gimbal that gets totally study handheld footage

67
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:53,180
and it's the same it's the same this is the same symbol that works with it's the

68
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:59,330
same gimbal that works on the drone i can now use an attached to stuff i'm not

69
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:03,590
going to pack up the drone take the gimbal skate to somewhere where I can

70
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:06,590
find fly the drone and test the gimbal

71
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:18,180
also I didn't show you the controller so haven't used it yet but one day I'm

72
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:23,460
totally psyched about it doesn't your phone like this is the whole touch

73
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:29,430
screen here controls here buttons here buttons here it's kind of like a

74
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:32,430
gigantic gameboy

75
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,349
alright thrown in backpack there

76
00:06:42,349 --> 00:06:49,610
this is the custom custom backpack that comes with no gonna try something right

77
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:53,689
I'm going to try to skate there with this thing on with this thing on my

78
00:06:53,689 --> 00:06:56,870
chest

79
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:02,539
alright this little guy right here it's stabilized and it's rolling

80
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:38,010
it was just able to stop the entire stabilizer to my chest pretty cool

81
00:07:43,849 --> 00:07:54,349
yeah

82
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:03,120
all right full disclosure this is the maiden flight my maiden flight probably

83
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,620
the universe maiden flight of a girl from karma in the wild

84
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:15,060
I've read no instruction manuals and I've had no instructions on this thing

85
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:20,850
here's what we're dealing with here I get the nice screen of available twenty

86
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:23,289
patients

87
00:08:23,289 --> 00:08:31,990
yes not yet obtained off i'm leveling irobot here we go

88
00:08:32,829 --> 00:08:35,829
you what

89
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,360
what

90
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,190
yeah

91
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,880
this thing is fast

92
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:23,070
yeah

93
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:33,640
ok is far against is like business is like the only GoPro karma prototype on

94
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:39,010
planet earth right now and I've got like a mile from me things up town okay bring

95
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:45,250
it back at 21 minutes left in this flight so i think it's time to step it

96
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:50,320
up a little bit and try something a little bit more complex that is the

97
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,000
operating the drone while flying the boosted board as my first time on this

98
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,590
thing so this will be telling all right wish me luck

99
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:17,130
yeah

100
00:10:27,089 --> 00:10:34,949
so that's it that is the first look at the GoPro karma drone system stable that

101
00:10:34,949 --> 00:10:38,160
was unfinished product the software wasn't finalized so I'm gonna reserve

102
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:44,519
giving you my judgment on it but i can say this it's very very exciting that

103
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:49,589
that is where things are headed like in one backpack is essentially like a fork

104
00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:54,749
a Steadicam a helicopter with a stabilized camp like if you had told the

105
00:10:54,749 --> 00:10:58,889
younger version of me don't have all of that available to me in a backpack I

106
00:10:58,889 --> 00:11:01,019
wouldn't believe you

107
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:06,899
all right full disclosure here obviously by the way I anymore after you push the

108
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:11,939
red button here this is colin from GoPro he's sort of been supervising my visit

109
00:11:11,939 --> 00:11:17,459
today with the prototype Karma's I've been telling him like don't tell me how

110
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:21,180
to use this let me figure this thing out but these are but I don't get to keep

111
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:26,910
these when i get one so we said today they'll be available in October 23rd

112
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:30,779
when I said I didn't get any instructions or anything I mean it when

113
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:33,600
I said that I had not been given any instructions i really want to try this

114
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,939
thing without anybody teaching me how do thank you for letting me play with it

115
00:11:38,939 --> 00:11:42,300
my pleasure thanks for going up we always love Sharon stop with you Casey

116
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:46,259
I'm very impressive to ride a boosted board that little practice something
