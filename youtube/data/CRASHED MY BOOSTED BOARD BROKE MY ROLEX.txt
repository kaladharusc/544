bring anything that I just felt most people look at my elbow

51
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:06,300
this is close to pornography as i will show on my channel this is what you call

52
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:17,250
camera pornography look at these deese open normal vehicle but it was regarded

53
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:22,800
for those of you not in the know the canon 5d mark for is like the newest

54
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,920
latest greatest benchmarked in camera

55
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:37,800
this is the old lens thank you i can you save your boy

56
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:48,310
yeah

57
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:51,310
yeah

58
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:56,379
million dollars isn't cool

59
00:05:56,379 --> 00:05:59,379
no it's cool

60
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,600
a billion dollars

61
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:23,170
that's right a billion my youtube channel just crossed 1 billion views 1

62
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:39,940
000 000 000 1 billion now I don't know really what or if that means anything

63
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:46,240
but I just remember years ago reading the New York Times an article titled the

64
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,610
girl with a billion views

65
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:54,250
it was about youtuber jennamarbles by Jenna and how she had accrued 1 billion

66
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:59,680
views and when I read that I was like my god that is an infallible number there

67
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,010
are only 300 million people in the United States of America there are only

68
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:09,040
seven billion people on the entire planet in this one young lady via our

69
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:13,570
YouTube to have 1 billion views in today I cross that threshold

70
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:23,020
thank you all 1 billion of you or 100 of you who have each watch 10 million views

71
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:28,090
or 1000 of you who have each watch 1 million views 1 million of you who have

72
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:29,830
each watched thank you

73
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:36,040
today I want to do a special 1,000,000,000 view Q&A have another Q&A

74
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,560
in a while getting a lot of requests for it so here we go

75
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,610
Gina what single video made the most impact in terms of those 1,000,000,000

76
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:47,170
ok the most impactful video from use a movie i made called bike lanes wait

77
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:47,830
right there

78
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:50,920
bike lanes was the first movie I made when I started my own YouTube channel

79
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:56,200
that truly went viral on YouTube demonstrated to me the power of YouTube

80
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:02,590
this one video in two days did more views than my entire HBO series did for

81
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:09,190
the life of the show and that blew my mind that affirmed my thinking that

82
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:14,170
YouTube was where I wanted to direct my focus for the future do you think you

83
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:17,980
can achieve a billion views this fast without the vlog no chance there's just

84
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:23,020
no way that you can get those kind of numbers without uploading a lot of

85
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:23,830
content

86
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:27,880
what video you the most proud of and the most part of a movie called my kidding

87
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,390
me

88
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:33,520
it's this like 22 minute epic i made about Owen John Barnes what's your

89
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,010
biggest advice for filmmakers on 13 years old

90
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:41,590
don't waste your time with film school we are a place right now in this genre

91
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:46,420
where you can buy a camera or you can use your cell phone to make videos that

92
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:51,430
will reach tens of thousands or millions or hundreds of millions of people you

93
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:55,930
don't need the formalities of filmmaking that they teach in school instead take

94
00:08:55,930 --> 00:09:00,520
the money that your parents or you or you would borrow to go to film school

95
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,700
take that money and spend it on living life

96
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:07,660
this is very much like Vernon Hertzog theory around filmmaking spend that

97
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:12,130
money spend those resources on experiences his filmmaking is not about

98
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:16,030
the craft it's not about the camera's not about the gear it's about telling

99
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:20,200
stories and sharing experiences and sharing perspectives and if you're only

100
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,580
perspectives in life are the ones your professor taught you in film school

101
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:28,390
you're gonna have a really tough time making something people care about i am

102
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:33,610
very much pro academia i am my kids in college right now and I could not be

103
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:34,810
more proud of him

104
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:38,980
it is film school that I take issue with no one can teach you how to be a

105
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:43,210
storyteller you have to live to be able to do that how are you celebrating

106
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,500
I'm not I'm not celebrating I'm making this video and i'm just putting my head

107
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:51,700
down and making more videos i believe in like benchmarks and I'm proud of 1

108
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:55,090
billion but with each successful comes a bigger more ambitious

109
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,840
with each success comes a bigger and more ambitious goal and this success

110
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,830
just motivates needed to do more do more YouTube do more in life create more make

111
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:07,340
more reach more people last questions I think it's romantic

112
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,950
how much credit do you get Candace on those 1 billion views about 950 million

113
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:17,870
of those 1 billion views i got after I married Candace having a support system

114
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:24,590
like a family is absolutely instrumental in keeping focus and working hard and

115
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:28,010
everything that contributes to your success to my success

116
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:32,300
yeah I mean don't tell her i said this right credit canvas would like all of my

117
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:36,290
success but don't tell her I said thanks to go straight to her head

118
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:50,430
honey I've got that what I was riding my skateboard really slowly and I was going

119
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:53,430

120

131
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:54,340

132
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,360
