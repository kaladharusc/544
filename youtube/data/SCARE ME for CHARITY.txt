3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:09,540
how's it going

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,360
welcome welcome welcome good morning one

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,340
and all thank you so much for joining me

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,710
on this fine morning just test out the

7
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,710
super chat for good feature and if you

8
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,119
don't know if the super TAF of good

9
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,070
feature it's basically a donation tool

10
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:24,930
that uses super chat so that it can go

11
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,930
through straight 100% of all the

12
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,640
donations go straight towards the

13
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,560
charity and you can pick any charity

14
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,110
that directly integrates into the system

15
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,520
now this is something that I've been

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,950
working towards for a while now some

17
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:39,480
people were talking about it obviously

18
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,860
this morning and I was commenting on the

19
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,450
elastic strain that wasn't supposed to

20
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,129
be posted publicly I was supposed to

21
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:46,110
remain unlisted which is usually the

22
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,670
setting but then settings on livestream

23
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:49,860
settings usually get jumbled around a

24
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,649
lot and I don't know why but as people

25
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:54,120
were saying I was experimenting with all

26
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,430
these different let me turn down this

27
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,620
music god this music is just thumping

28
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,840
right now I was experimenting with like

29
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,280
the notification settings because I

30
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,780
whined there to be a better way that

31
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,170
people could notify me and interact with

32
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,180
me on stream and also test out these

33
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,250
systems so that they would be ready so

34
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,720
that I could do something like this

35
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,939
which is called scare me for charity

36
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:17,880
I've got notifications and I've upped it

37
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,040
I've steadily upped it as they go by the

38
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,799
first stream I had them like low so

39
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,180
there was nothing but spam the whole

40
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,400
time this time I've got it a more

41
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,320
reasonable or last time I had a little

42
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,610
more reasonable but who's still a lot

43
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,159
now the alert can only go off if a

44
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,759
donation of $50 or more is there and if

45
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,790
even that is a bit too much then I'll

46
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,950
have to raise it a little bit more so

47
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,270
that only the hundred dollar donation is

48
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:43,710
actually go on-screen but I've also got

49
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,420
the event list so that anybody that

50
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,280
donates will be shown up there and all

51
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,700
money goes to the cystic fibrosis

52
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:53,060
Research Institute I believe that it is

53
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,840
there's a lot of cystic fibrosis

54
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,180
charities out there but this one is CF

55
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,430
or I you can check it out it should pop

56
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,000
up right in right in the chat there so

57
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,259
you should be able to see it as soon as

58
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:06,509
it comes up and then hopefully that'll

59
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:09,330
all work out so any and all donations

60
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,440

208
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,410
families and caregivers nearly all of

209
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:18,300
CFR is originally founders have since

210
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,400
lost their children to cystic fibrosis

211
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,440
yet they've remained active and I think

212
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,660
I've got my pause button working right

213
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:27,360
now finally yet they've remained active

214
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,500
with the organization because of their

215
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,700
commitment to find a cure for this

216
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,610
debilitating disease it is a rough one

217
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:34,469
cystic fibrosis used to be a death

218
00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:37,289
sentence for children it's it's as far

219
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:38,969
as I have a rough understanding of it

220
00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:39,960
this is not something that I fully

221
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,250
understand this is something that I was

222
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,320
talking with my moderators earlier this

223
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,640
morning I was like what's a good what's

224
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,720
a good cause they were like cystic

225
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,850
fibrosis I was like I say it's sitting

226
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:49,500
fibrosis but I I've never raised money

227
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,560
for it as far as I know it's it's what

228
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,690
it breaks down to is a mucus gets caught

229
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:57,360
in the basically the lining of the lungs

230
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,860
and it makes it harder and harder to

231
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,400
breathe and this gets worse and worse

232
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,360
throughout a child's life and it gets

233
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,120
worse and worse and then you know it it

234
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,790
it does kill a lot of kids and it's

235
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,290
killed a lot of kids in the past but

236
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:14,100
lately there's been a lot of new

237
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,280
research in it new call new new new new

238
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,800
not cures but new treatments that have

239
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,150
come out of the research that people

240
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,950
have done so if you guys can give some

241
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:24,930
it's almost to the point where cystic

242
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:27,090
fibrosis can be a completely curable

243
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:29,400
disease the lifetime I was reading up on

244
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,570
it just before we did this but the

245
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,880
lifetime expectancy now where it was

246
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,220
barely through your teen years now it's

247
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,200
up to 30 years of life expectancy and

248
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,870
beyond because if that 30 years started

249
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,030
today then in 30 years we can hopefully

250
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:44,580
cure this disease and keep it going so

251
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,589
with that being said that you can find

252
00:09:46,589 --> 00:09:48,120

happens is I've raised the threshold on

raised it every time I've done a stream

are we up to what are we up to

817
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:29,100
that's $16,000 okay let's all just agree

818
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:34,050
to calm down let's just agree to calm

I'll get through chanel bush thank you

826
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:03,630
thank you here's the door I haven't all

827
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:04,320
right

828
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:09,900
where is this ah Thank You Vanessa this

829
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:12,090
is where I came from so all I gotta do

830
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:13,620
is I gotta find a way I didn't go in

831
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:14,070
here

832
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:19,170
tada and there she blows all right

833
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:20,550
Shannon figured well I like to imagine

834
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:21,810
these sounds are actually happening in

835
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:23,940
the game they are for me okay hang on

836
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:27,330
I'm pausing pausing alerts we're taking

837
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:33,109
a nice breather

838
00:40:33,109 --> 00:40:36,599
okay the following guide will cover all

839
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:38,400
the most important information regarding

840
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,680
the machinery the main piston which

841
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,239
stimulates the steam pressure in a

842
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:44,309
proper way needs to be powered with

843
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:47,579
whale oil though it can also be powered

844
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:50,519
by various types of fuel weight or only

845
00:40:50,519 --> 00:40:52,349
is the most safe and reliable source of

846
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:54,390
energy the piston will not move as long

847
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:56,249
as the furnace isn't lit boiling the

848
00:40:56,249 --> 00:40:58,019
water in the tank below and causing the

849
00:40:58,019 --> 00:41:00,269
piston mechanism to move once the piston

850
00:41:00,269 --> 00:41:01,920
descends down there is hot enough hot

851
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,229
water in the boiler to blow to generate

852
00:41:04,229 --> 00:41:05,549
the required amount of heat in order to

853
00:41:05,549 --> 00:41:06,989
stabilize the steam pressure in the

854
00:41:06,989 --> 00:41:10,099
pipes which later flows in the

855
00:41:10,099 --> 00:41:12,930
mechanisms above the elevator powering

856
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:14,460
the cogwheels and generating sufficient

857
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:15,809
amount of power to raise the gate and

858
00:41:15,809 --> 00:41:21,650
make the elevator able to work okay

859
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:24,690
thank you I'm gonna try to con straight

860
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:27,259

00:45:40,010 --> 00:45:42,140
hopefully some great strides can be made

940
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:47,030
in the research very soon okay the old

941
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:50,180
vault entrance okay that's stuck okay so

942
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:51,650
I think I gotta take the whale oil over

943
00:45:51,650 --> 00:45:52,940
here I don't know why I cracked open

944

rest of this up and running there was a

979
00:48:13,210 --> 00:48:15,490
note that we got that had some of the

980
00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:19,030
stuff so we need a piston will not move

981
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:21,790
as long as furnaces and lit boiling the

982
00:48:21,790 --> 00:48:22,990
water in the tank blowing causing the

983
00:48:22,990 --> 00:48:24,430
piston mechanism to move once it

984
00:48:24,430 --> 00:48:25,599
descends there's enough hot water and

985
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:29,290
the boiler see ya later flows powering

986
00:48:29,290 --> 00:48:30,849
the cogwheels so I got to find the

987
00:48:30,849 --> 00:48:33,579
cogwheels I bet I gotta bring those bow

988
00:48:33,579 --> 00:48:36,640
I bet I gotta bring those back here well

989
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:42,309
shit might go down soon I guess so if

990
00:48:42,309 --> 00:48:43,210
the cogwheels

991
00:48:43,210 --> 00:48:46,770
aren't in here

992
00:48:46,770 --> 00:48:49,930
Jesus and if I can't use these and that

993
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:51,369
means the cogwheels gotta be elsewhere

994
00:48:51,369 --> 00:48:57,000
so I got to go find them I think I made

995
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,290

1001
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:16,359
to be some kind of a cogwheel storage

1002
00:49:16,359 --> 00:49:22,930
area somewhere over here okay I told you

1003

I told you guys it would settle down

1004
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:24,880

don't know where fuck I don't know where

1030
00:50:41,370 --> 00:50:45,330
a cock wheel would be unless I don't

1031
00:50:45,330 --> 00:50:47,490
need a cog wheel cuz I don't think I've

1032
00:50:47,490 --> 00:50:51,060
seen a fully-functional cog wheel in

1033
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:54,470
this entire area I think it's been more

1034
00:50:54,470 --> 00:50:59,190
I'm justified but City don't change I

1035
00:50:59,190 --> 00:51:02,580
have seen many cog wheels I've seen so

1036
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:05,550
I'm a cog wheel salesman here come to my

1037
00:51:05,550 --> 00:51:08,790
cog wheel powered car I'll open my cog

1038
00:51:08,790 --> 00:51:12,240
drunk and bequeath you with cog wheels

1039
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:21,030
as far as the eye can see this has got

1040
00:51:21,030 --> 00:51:26,610
to be okay this would this would tell me

1041
00:51:26,610 --> 00:51:27,840
like if there's nothing in this one this

1042
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:31,350
is nothing period right so the answer

1043
00:51:31,350 --> 00:51:33,000
would have to be in that area why did I

1044
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:37,530
open this then I don't know some of

1045

00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:35,670
than that was lying somewhere in the end

Caesar defeated until they were finally

1116
00:55:36,930 --> 00:55:38,130
able to enter the structure looked much

1117
00:55:38,130 --> 00:55:39,090
older than anything else they've ever

1118

expected

1119
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:41,670
tunnels were blurred with an unknown

1120
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:43,020
language consisting of words that seemed

1121
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:44,430
almost gibberish as if someone tried to

1122
00:55:44,430 --> 00:55:51,580

wolfburg very little is known about this

1129
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:09,490
mystical its history roots back to the

1130
00:56:09,490 --> 00:56:11,350
14th century when ADA was originally

1131
00:56:11,350 --> 00:56:13,120
built by Prussian King to the Rothschild

1132
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:15,220
family as a reward for Edmond von

1133
00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:17,800
Rothschilds military services though it

1134
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:19,570
stood well for several centuries and

1135
00:56:19,570 --> 00:56:21,760
further genres of the family continued

1136
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:23,320
to live in the fortress at some point of

1137
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:24,640
the history something caused them to

1206
01:00:09,719 --> 01:00:11,380
okay it's a big loop

1207
01:00:11,380 --> 01:00:14,830

1208
01:00:14,830 --> 01:00:18,940
came across over here there was one that

1209
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:20,230
was locked and there was one that there

1210
01:00:20,230 --> 01:00:21,940
was a noise behind I mean we got this

1211
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:23,860
constant drone of the machinery here

1212
01:00:23,860 --> 01:00:26,760

people that need it that's that's an

1301
01:04:59,670 --> 01:05:00,990
amazing thing that should not be

1302
01:05:00,990 --> 01:05:03,300
discounted in any way and and it's not

1303
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:04,860
just like the big donations going

1304
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:07,170
through the majority of that probably is

1305
01:05:07,170 --> 01:05:09,570

1306
01:05:09,570 --> 01:05:12,000
donations the 10 the 5 the 2 the one

1307

1349
01:07:25,470 --> 01:07:28,050
constant swords are really really really

1350
01:07:28,050 --> 01:07:31,109
lacking in instructions like they're

1351
01:07:31,109 --> 01:07:32,730
lacking in instructions lacking in

1352
01:07:32,730 --> 01:07:34,800
directions this wood is highly rated

1353
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:37,320
that's the thing like this particular

1354
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:39,180
custom story is very highly rated I

1355

found the thing in the bucket of shit my

1356

lights I found the thing in the bucket

1357
01:07:43,369 --> 01:07:47,730
so that was important I'm guessing this

1358
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:54,229
is not important because it's don't what

1359

1375
01:08:39,210 --> 01:08:40,469
the donations from super Jack go

1376
01:08:40,469 --> 01:08:42,810

1377

blinking yes they are

1378
01:08:47,420 --> 01:08:49,679
yes smaller donations don't set off

1379
01:08:49,679 --> 01:08:51,210
alerts because if they did it would be

1380
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:52,739
constant spam like it wasn't the

1381
01:08:52,739 --> 01:08:55,190
beginning of this but they are as always

1382
01:08:55,190 --> 01:08:57,389
appreciated and the bulk of it

1383
01:08:57,389 --> 01:08:59,310
mr. white flop seems somebody donate can

1384
01:08:59,310 --> 01:09:01,619
inspire love you mark that's that's that

1385
01:09:01,619 --> 01:09:04,710
is 100% true you really really honestly

1386
01:09:04,710 --> 01:09:07,889
truly cannot put a price on inspiration

1387
01:09:07,889 --> 01:09:11,040
and it seems like a silly thing but

1388
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:13,020
inspiration is a lot of the driving

1389
01:09:13,020 --> 01:09:16,259
force of what like keeps humanity moving

1390
01:09:16,259 --> 01:09:18,960
it's like sick inspiration flies in the

1391
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:20,790
face of logic a lot of times and I'm not

1392
01:09:20,790 --> 01:09:23,040
equating this to anything like of of the

1393
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:24,989
days of old where inspiration came at

1394
01:09:24,989 --> 01:09:28,679
the cost of life whoa bacon sex sadly

1395
01:09:28,679 --> 01:09:30,179
this is my last donation Opie will help

1396
01:09:30,179 --> 01:09:30,730
it

1397
01:09:30,730 --> 01:09:35,100
it does but when it comes down to like

1398
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:38,170
certain certain sources of inspiration

1399
01:09:38,170 --> 01:09:41,020
like things that don't make sense in a

1400
01:09:41,020 --> 01:09:43,359
logical capacity but do make sense when

1401
01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:45,430
you when you realize like what it needs

1402
01:09:45,430 --> 01:09:47,859
to in the future and and the ideas that

1403
01:09:47,859 --> 01:09:49,870
it give people because Thank You Megan a

1404
01:09:49,870 --> 01:09:52,210
lot of humanity is just spreading ideas

1405
01:09:52,210 --> 01:09:54,130
and like sharing ideas so having that

1406
01:09:54,130 --> 01:09:56,020
ability to share ideas with people and

1407
01:09:56,020 --> 01:09:58,720
be able to like say something to someone

1408
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:07,630
else is important it really is I don't

1409
01:10:07,630 --> 01:10:09,640
know what I'm doing by the way I am at a

1410
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:11,770
complete loss oh wait no I didn't check

1411
01:10:11,770 --> 01:10:13,780
there was another one ah there's another

1412
01:10:13,780 --> 01:10:17,640
over here what the hell this is open now

1413
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:19,860
has this been open this whole time

1414
01:10:19,860 --> 01:10:21,940
during my latest expedition to Egypt

1415
01:10:21,940 --> 01:10:23,710
I've acquired the first piece of what I

1416
01:10:23,710 --> 01:10:25,510
believe forms a much bigger asset an

1417
01:10:25,510 --> 01:10:28,950
ancient war but thank you Skyler shove

1418
01:10:28,950 --> 01:10:31,420
the orb itself is a powerful artifact

1419
01:10:31,420 --> 01:10:33,730
which grants strength and magical force

1420
01:10:33,730 --> 01:10:36,700
increase Minh mm-hmm though I own only

1421
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:38,380
one piece if it was like they found this

1422
01:10:38,380 --> 01:10:40,060
orb and they found a little letter next

1423
01:10:40,060 --> 01:10:42,610
to it was like make your penis so much

1424
01:10:42,610 --> 01:10:45,580
bigger through the power of magic and

1425
01:10:45,580 --> 01:10:47,980
they were just like it's magical force

1426
01:10:47,980 --> 01:10:50,140
increasement it's free real estate

1427
01:10:50,140 --> 01:10:52,900
though I own only one piece I'm almost

1428
01:10:52,900 --> 01:10:54,280
certain that there are more of them in

1429
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:55,989
this world currently I'm trying to draw

1430
01:10:55,989 --> 01:10:57,880
as much power as I can thank you Joe

1431
01:10:57,880 --> 01:11:00,910
Richards my wife has CF and it's great

1432
01:11:00,910 --> 01:11:02,230
to see everyone bringing more awareness

1433
01:11:02,230 --> 01:11:05,409
to this I'm glad that we can

1434
01:11:05,409 --> 01:11:07,600
thank you to Abby Fame Haymarket Larry

1435
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:08,980
you've been my favorite youtuber into my

1436
01:11:08,980 --> 01:11:10,360
big brother my pop always told me to

1437
01:11:10,360 --> 01:11:11,620
give people a neat and you want to help

1438
01:11:11,620 --> 01:11:12,730
others like this I have to keep going

1439
01:11:12,730 --> 01:11:14,380
and keep giving I will and you guys will

1440
01:11:14,380 --> 01:11:16,360
do I'm trying to draw as much power as I

1441
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:17,949
can while also researching the possible

1442
01:11:17,949 --> 01:11:19,840
locations of the other pieces I can't

1443
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:21,280
imagine the amount of potential it is

1444
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:23,500
capable of I believe I found a way to

1445
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:26,020
transfer human mind and soul into

1446
01:11:26,020 --> 01:11:28,870
lifeless statues that's not good Jay the

1447
01:11:28,870 --> 01:11:30,730
curious thank you so much

1448
01:11:30,730 --> 01:11:33,400
I found a way to using the advanced form

1449
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:34,870
of magic conjuration I've been able to

1450
01:11:34,870 --> 01:11:36,760
animate a statue using a foreign soul in

1451
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:38,679
mind though he was very weak I believe

1452
01:11:38,679 --> 01:11:40,090
that with the help of the orb shard he

1453
01:11:40,090 --> 01:11:41,920
will become more powerful with the whole

1454
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:43,600
orb deform together my servants will be

1455
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:45,639
indestructible it seems as if something

1456
01:11:45,639 --> 01:11:46,989
keeps trying to stop me from animating

1457
01:11:46,989 --> 01:11:47,800
the statues

1458
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:49,540
I hear loud noises above the ceiling

1459
01:11:49,540 --> 01:11:51,670
something on sometimes underneath the

1460
01:11:51,670 --> 01:11:53,620
ground I hear something unknown drawer

1461
01:11:53,620 --> 01:11:55,929
in the distance what can that be is my

1462
01:11:55,929 --> 01:11:58,150
mind playing tricks on me or something

1463
01:11:58,150 --> 01:12:00,489
more sinister while being able to

1464
01:12:00,489 --> 01:12:02,260
transfer men into statues I'm not sure

1465
01:12:02,260 --> 01:12:03,489
whether I'm lacking something or not

1466
01:12:03,489 --> 01:12:05,429
conjuration seems to be an inefficient

1467
01:12:05,429 --> 01:12:07,449
inefficient a source of energy for these

1468
01:12:07,449 --> 01:12:09,610
creatures i must find another way but

1469
01:12:09,610 --> 01:12:12,429
that's not good why would you do that

1470
01:12:12,429 --> 01:12:15,120
wouldn't they be more useful as people

1471
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:17,050
wouldn't that be a thing that would be

1472
01:12:17,050 --> 01:12:19,360
more useful like infinitely more useful

1473
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:22,659
no just a big no on that one

1474
01:12:22,659 --> 01:12:25,239
okay whatever alright so is there

1475
01:12:25,239 --> 01:12:28,320
something here that can help me whoa

1476
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:34,360
acetaldehyde yes please oh that's a

1477
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:39,470
little odd garbage already blue

1478
01:12:39,470 --> 01:12:43,130
okay all right I like me some

1479
01:12:43,130 --> 01:12:46,610
acetaldehyde mix this without Stella

1480
01:12:46,610 --> 01:12:50,240
okay is this like an acid or something a

1481
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:52,460
full of substance that belongs to

1482
01:12:52,460 --> 01:12:55,900
aldehydes

1483
01:12:55,900 --> 01:12:59,510
yes as it starts it's free real estate

1484
01:12:59,510 --> 01:13:03,950
indeed it is okay but I think that was

1485
01:13:03,950 --> 01:13:08,060
probably important probably there we go

1486
01:13:08,060 --> 01:13:11,980
okay now we've got some progress oh

1487

scared for my life are they related to

1499
01:13:36,170 --> 01:13:38,150
the orb piece I found it seems as if

1500
01:13:38,150 --> 01:13:39,710
they keep trying to follow me everywhere

1501
01:13:39,710 --> 01:13:41,480
I go every time I do something I

1502
01:13:41,480 --> 01:13:45,590
couldn't sleep some days $200 from gem

1503
01:13:45,590 --> 01:13:48,020
chin you need something more powerful

1504
01:13:48,020 --> 01:13:50,240
huh obviously this custom game doesn't

1505
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:52,130
know who's playing it I didn't shove a

1506
01:13:52,130 --> 01:13:54,950
chair and do it huh let's see it seems

1507
01:13:54,950 --> 01:13:56,000
it as they keep following me around

1508
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,620
everywhere I go every time I do

1509
01:13:57,620 --> 01:13:59,300
something I couldn't sleep for several

1510
01:13:59,300 --> 01:14:01,010
days at all I feel uneasy

1511
01:14:01,010 --> 01:14:03,080
I feel alien presence among my fortress

1512
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:05,180
I locked the cells and hid the key in my

1513
01:14:05,180 --> 01:14:06,860
secret transformation room the

1514
01:14:06,860 --> 01:14:07,970
perspective of getting all those

1515
01:14:07,970 --> 01:14:09,860
prisoners isolated from me makes me

1516
01:14:09,860 --> 01:14:11,810
slightly more comfortable sadly though

1517
01:14:11,810 --> 01:14:15,980

Thank You Kenneth F Bergeon the most

1584
01:17:29,810 --> 01:17:31,160
frightening is when your mom is angry

01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:35,570
and calls you by your phone I think we

1586
01:17:35,570 --> 01:17:36,980
can all agree that is indeed the most

1587
01:17:36,980 --> 01:17:38,120
frightening moment in the entire

1588
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:40,280
existence of humanity if you get called

1589
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:41,480
by your full name by your mother

1590
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:43,370
especially my mother who never even

1591
01:17:43,370 --> 01:17:46,190
calls me by my right name anyway if she

1592
01:17:46,190 --> 01:17:47,720
calls me by my full name I know I'm

1593
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:51,790

01:37:19,660 --> 01:37:25,030
am a man we can find common ground my

1867
01:37:25,030 --> 01:37:28,060
ancestor invented you a long time ago so

you die but amicably so listen it is

existing even worth it huh is existing

1871
01:37:39,880 --> 01:37:42,330
even worth it maybe you could just not

1872
01:37:42,330 --> 01:37:47,520
exist and we'd all be happier for it

1873

just roll over and die

my mom said Lorelei said you need a

1876
01:38:01,750 --> 01:38:03,580
flammable substance and you place it

1877
01:38:03,580 --> 01:38:05,080
under the wheel and you can throw

1878
01:38:05,080 --> 01:38:06,820
something at it delighted that's weird

that's what this guy it was red the only

thing that's red in this whole goddamn

01:38:13,540 --> 01:38:17,650
game is what's behind this door that I

1882
01:38:17,650 --> 01:38:21,300
can't get into because the mechanism is

pipes are you can break a certain pipe

1886
01:38:31,999 --> 01:38:33,530
to stop the same circuit it might work

1887
01:38:33,530 --> 01:38:37,099
it's not real it's a game the logic in

1888
01:38:37,099 --> 01:38:39,079
this game isn't the same as the logic in

save probably because I hadn't made it

1903
01:41:55,170 --> 01:41:56,880
far enough in the game to even bother

1904
01:41:56,880 --> 01:42:00,000
saving probably that's probably what the

game thought so you know that's fine

1906
01:42:02,760 --> 01:42:04,980
because I was so distracted by all of

01:46:45,719 --> 01:46:47,070
you for everybody sticking with me as I

1983
01:46:47,070 --> 01:46:49,679
find a nice balance to the alerts yes I

1984
01:46:49,679 --> 01:46:50,910
know it can get annoying at times

1985
01:46:50,910 --> 01:46:54,179
especially for me like I am also being

1986
01:46:54,179 --> 01:46:56,489
subjected to this but also there is a

1987
01:46:56,489 --> 01:46:59,340
fine balance because what I want what I

1988
01:46:59,340 --> 01:47:00,810
want is to be able to communicate with

1989
01:47:00,810 --> 01:47:02,730
people that is like really at the heart

1990
01:47:02,730 --> 01:47:04,290
of everything I do I want to be able to

1991
01:47:04,290 --> 01:47:06,480
talk to people I want to be able to have

1992
01:47:06,480 --> 01:47:07,980
a discussion with people I want people

1993
01:47:07,980 --> 01:47:09,630
to feel like I'm not just an in

1994
01:47:09,630 --> 01:47:11,830
approachable like

1995
01:47:11,830 --> 01:47:13,750
asshole at the top of a mountain you

1996
01:47:13,750 --> 01:47:15,100
know I don't want to ever come across

1997
01:47:15,100 --> 01:47:17,110
like that so it is important for me that

1998
01:47:17,110 --> 01:47:18,250
people are able to figure out a way to

1999
01:47:18,250 --> 01:47:20,830
do it and thank you guys for bearing

2000
01:47:20,830 --> 01:47:24,010
with me like also number one I really

2001
01:47:24,010 --> 01:47:26,440
like screamin I do I'm not gonna scream

2002
01:47:26,440 --> 01:47:28,210
full time that's for sure I'm never

2003
01:47:28,210 --> 01:47:29,440
gonna be able to do that because I never

2004
01:47:29,440 --> 01:47:31,960
have that time to do that but I am like

2005
01:47:31,960 --> 01:47:34,450
you know I do want to stream as much as

2006
01:47:34,450 --> 01:47:37,060
I can you know whatever I can and I

2007
01:47:37,060 --> 01:47:38,620
think there's something very nice about

2008
01:47:38,620 --> 01:47:43,740
being able to communicate with people

2009
01:47:43,740 --> 01:47:46,030
well I'm an in person

2010
01:47:46,030 --> 01:47:48,700
there's something about that so it's

2011
01:47:48,700 --> 01:47:51,280
it's important to me to have the

2012
01:47:51,280 --> 01:47:53,200
opportunity to do it it's important to

2013
01:47:53,200 --> 01:47:54,430
me to try to like live up to the

2014
01:47:54,430 --> 01:47:56,290
expectations that I have for myself and

2015
01:47:56,290 --> 01:47:58,330
I do normal videos in terms of live I

2016
01:47:58,330 --> 01:48:00,970
don't want a live stream shittily you

2017
01:48:00,970 --> 01:48:01,510
know what I mean

2018
01:48:01,510 --> 01:48:03,310
I don't want to do a shit live stream I

2019
01:48:03,310 --> 01:48:04,870
want to do the best in everything that I

2020
01:48:04,870 --> 01:48:13,770
ever do whether or not that's like oh

2021
01:48:13,770 --> 01:48:16,150
what that wasn't there before

2022
01:48:16,150 --> 01:48:20,770
what yeah anyway like I have I have a

2023
01:48:20,770 --> 01:48:22,450
certain standard for myself like I'd

2024
01:48:22,450 --> 01:48:24,400
like to make sure that I do things as

2025
01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:26,050
best as I possibly can

2026
01:48:26,050 --> 01:48:27,730
and that includes like trying to be the

2027
01:48:27,730 --> 01:48:30,100
best in terms of live stream and it

2028
01:48:30,100 --> 01:48:31,600
wouldn't your live stream like it's a

2029
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:33,130
very recognized fact that you got to

2030
01:48:33,130 --> 01:48:35,500
acknowledge when people are trying to

2031
01:48:35,500 --> 01:48:37,780
give you something or contribute to a

2032
01:48:37,780 --> 01:48:39,520
cause I don't want to be sure that I am

2033
01:48:39,520 --> 01:48:41,560
as best as I can be in terms of that

2034
01:48:41,560 --> 01:48:43,720
department so that is why I do that and

2035
01:48:43,720 --> 01:48:45,010
that's why it's important to me and

2036
01:48:45,010 --> 01:48:46,720
that's why also these causes are

2037
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:49,960
importantly like the the charity causes

2038
01:48:49,960 --> 01:48:52,720
- I've spent a lot of time in the past

save my game then but that's okay I

2051
01:50:09,560 --> 01:50:11,020

2058
01:50:56,660 --> 01:50:59,870
most rage-inducing in these custom story

2059
01:50:59,870 --> 01:51:02,860
I've ever played in my entire existence

2060
01:51:02,860 --> 01:51:06,110

2061
01:51:06,110 --> 01:51:08,150
vessels while I'm playing this one I'm

2062
01:51:08,150 --> 01:51:11,360
going to literally like lose I'll lose

2063
01:51:11,360 --> 01:51:14,030
years off my life because of this game

2064
01:51:14,030 --> 01:51:18,730
like this particular custom story oh oh

2065
01:51:18,730 --> 01:51:21,740
it's just so fascinating to see how

2066
01:51:21,740 --> 01:51:24,320
people can just make things go wrong you

2067
01:51:24,320 --> 01:51:26,480
know there I see that the developer has

2068
01:51:26,480 --> 01:51:28,250
the best of intentions with this game

2069
01:51:28,250 --> 01:51:31,310
and you know you just thank you Dalton

2070

spaghetti actually and it's fascinating

2074
01:51:44,180 --> 01:51:46,390
because I've made it barely like to

2075
01:51:46,390 --> 01:51:50,000
probably 2% to 5% into this game's

2076
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:51,980
intended ending because they said that

2077
01:51:51,980 --> 01:51:56,270
this game has three hours of content and

2078
01:51:56,270 --> 01:52:01,990
I've made it through ten minutes of it

2079

there's a secret passage of the library

2139
01:55:46,739 --> 01:55:48,809
and I would believe that because I would

2140
01:55:48,809 --> 01:55:50,459
not believe that this library is just

2141
01:55:50,459 --> 01:55:53,099
here for the sake of being here there's

2142

come back because the only thing that I

2159
01:57:58,770 --> 01:58:02,580
can do is to the only thing that I could

2160
01:58:02,580 --> 01:58:05,670

2189
01:59:36,780 --> 01:59:39,980
reset so I can actually go through it

02:18:25,700 --> 02:18:27,529
in the wind I'm too much of an expert in

2418
02:18:27,529 --> 02:18:30,559
this game to even be remotely spooked by

2419
02:18:30,559 --> 02:18:32,179
the likes of that so don't even think

2420
02:18:32,179 --> 02:18:33,830
that you could get on my level of spook

2421
02:18:33,830 --> 02:18:36,500
edge because you cannot after many hours

2422
02:18:36,500 --> 02:18:38,239
invested in studying alchemy I've

2423
02:18:38,239 --> 02:18:40,010
created an interesting recipe for a

2424
02:18:40,010 --> 02:18:42,010
substance which I call mercury fulminate

2425
02:18:42,010 --> 02:18:44,809
it's created by mixing aqua Fortis with

2426
02:18:44,809 --> 02:18:46,910
Mercury nitrate and then heating this

2427
02:18:46,910 --> 02:18:49,160
grated substance on a burner after the

2428
02:18:49,160 --> 02:18:50,450
chemical is warm enough the burner shall

2429
02:18:50,450 --> 02:18:51,500
be turned off and the last ingredient

2430
02:18:51,500 --> 02:18:54,050
needs to be poured in acetaldehyde the

2431
02:18:54,050 --> 02:18:55,580
liquid is now ready to be collected

2432
02:18:55,580 --> 02:19:00,950
explosion Eric Maynard you should place

2433
02:19:00,950 --> 02:19:04,700
Lennie Tubby's the devil among us okay

2434
02:19:04,700 --> 02:19:08,090
that sounds like a fun game the liquid

2435
02:19:08,090 --> 02:19:09,559
is now ready to be collected and stored

2436
02:19:09,559 --> 02:19:12,670
for a short period of time in the safe

2437
02:19:12,670 --> 02:19:16,550
is that delayed or is that new I'm

2438
02:19:16,550 --> 02:19:17,929
assuming that's delayed though I don't

2439
02:19:17,929 --> 02:19:19,519
have any use for yet it might come in

2440
02:19:19,519 --> 02:19:20,689
handy if we're moving the rubble

2441
02:19:20,689 --> 02:19:23,569
blocking their ruined tunnels which

2442
02:19:23,569 --> 02:19:25,700
pierced the castle from down below the

2443
02:19:25,700 --> 02:19:27,590
fortress has a solid structure so using

2444
02:19:27,590 --> 02:19:29,210
such brutal substance shouldn't worry me

2445
02:19:29,210 --> 02:19:30,769
at all I'm still in search for the

2446
02:19:30,769 --> 02:19:32,660
remaining orb pieces I've managed to

2447
02:19:32,660 --> 02:19:34,099
determine that one of them is located in

2448
02:19:34,099 --> 02:19:35,389
the ancient four lone underground on

2449
02:19:35,389 --> 02:19:38,320
beneath the city of Center hole just

2450
02:19:38,320 --> 02:19:40,540
just 20 kilometres away from the castle

2451
02:19:40,540 --> 02:19:42,970
the tunnels underneath the area are most

2452
02:19:42,970 --> 02:19:45,250
likely to be built during the periods of

2453
02:19:45,250 --> 02:19:46,660
Roman Empire although due to the

2454
02:19:46,660 --> 02:19:48,730
difficult conditions present here I'm

2455
02:19:48,730 --> 02:19:50,230
not gonna be able to go there just yet

2456
02:19:50,230 --> 02:19:52,061
I need more preparations propositions

2457
02:19:52,061 --> 02:19:57,120
send my trusted servant Howard

2458
02:19:57,120 --> 02:20:00,971
Joseph call the blacksmith you know I

2459
02:20:00,971 --> 02:20:02,410
don't think the blacksmith can help me

2460
02:20:02,410 --> 02:20:08,530
at this juncture okay so I need to find

2461
02:20:08,530 --> 02:20:11,290
a burner that seems to be the long and

2462
02:20:11,290 --> 02:20:12,971
the short of what I need to do I've got

2463
02:20:12,971 --> 02:20:15,800
the hiccups but where do I do that

2464
02:20:15,800 --> 02:20:17,021
[Music]

2465
02:20:17,021 --> 02:20:19,620
okay so

2466
02:20:19,620 --> 02:20:23,640
all right whatever so I don't know why

2467
02:20:23,640 --> 02:20:25,649
they're prisoners still alive down here

2468
02:20:25,649 --> 02:20:28,859
or how they're even alive and man is it

2469
02:20:28,859 --> 02:20:30,810
just me or is this music like blaringly

2470
02:20:30,810 --> 02:20:33,240

2479

2480
02:21:04,280 --> 02:21:07,680

2481
02:21:07,680 --> 02:21:10,590

have just missed it where maybe where

2487
02:21:30,400 --> 02:21:34,240
the Shelf blew off the shelf blew itself

2488
02:21:34,240 --> 02:21:38,080

2489
02:21:38,080 --> 02:21:38,830

2490
02:21:38,830 --> 02:21:40,600
I don't see a secret passageway Thank

2491
02:21:40,600 --> 02:21:45,900
You agent Shepard I don't see anything

that's my painting nothing there nothing

2493
02:21:48,670 --> 02:21:51,220
there okay so it's got to be seen one of

2494
02:21:51,220 --> 02:21:53,080
these other things right it's got to be

2495
02:21:53,080 --> 02:21:54,310
in one of the others thank you wind

2496
02:21:54,310 --> 02:21:57,610
image just has to be oh maybe he was

2497
02:21:57,610 --> 02:22:00,100
upstairs oh there was a lot of stuff

2498
02:22:00,100 --> 02:22:02,620
upstairs sciency looking stuff so

2499
02:22:02,620 --> 02:22:05,560
there's probably something upstairs some

2500
02:22:05,560 --> 02:22:09,820
kind of a burner here no no Bernie no

2501
02:22:09,820 --> 02:22:13,600
burner no burners none really none okay

2502
02:22:13,600 --> 02:22:15,880
whatever all right let's keep looking in

2503
02:22:15,880 --> 02:22:18,490
here then I would imagine that in one of

2504
02:22:18,490 --> 02:22:21,160
these there would be something I just

2505
02:22:21,160 --> 02:22:25,150
got to find it right some of these are

2506
02:22:25,150 --> 02:22:28,149
open

2507
02:22:28,149 --> 02:22:30,470
No

2508
02:22:30,470 --> 02:22:33,900
No

2509
02:22:33,900 --> 02:22:36,581
you're locked cuz you're either dead or

2510

sleeping I don't know which I'd prefer

2511
02:22:38,141 --> 02:22:41,171
at the moment maybe I could throw my way

2512
02:22:41,171 --> 02:22:48,061
through here and now this one's open I

2513
02:22:48,061 --> 02:22:50,860
guess I would see something of use

2514
02:22:50,860 --> 02:23:05,070
before I before I just go in there no

2515

big brain okay being in great danger

2656
02:33:20,530 --> 02:33:22,390
I've decided to start moving my abode to

2657
02:33:22,390 --> 02:33:23,950
the ancient shrine I've uncovered in the

2658
02:33:23,950 --> 02:33:27,720
curtsy lingering forest whoa

2659
02:33:27,720 --> 02:33:30,010
Brannon wheeler why you no play space

2660
02:33:30,010 --> 02:33:32,050
engineers you know I asked myself the

2661
02:33:32,050 --> 02:33:34,149
same question every day the shrine

2662
02:33:34,149 --> 02:33:35,800
bricked and buried under the rubble but

2663
02:33:35,800 --> 02:33:37,600
look this who's claimed it then haunted

2664
02:33:37,600 --> 02:33:43,990
ever since it's so loud it's so loud the

2665
02:33:43,990 --> 02:33:46,920
most promising one concerns of myth Rama

2666
02:33:46,920 --> 02:33:55,061
is this really the time to go

2667
02:33:55,061 --> 02:33:57,070
the passages have been secured by the

2668
02:33:57,070 --> 02:33:58,690
worshipers just days before we were

2669
02:33:58,690 --> 02:34:00,641
forced to flee though it is unknown what

2670
02:34:00,641 --> 02:34:02,200
caused them to do so but I have my

2671
02:34:02,200 --> 02:34:04,000
assumptions it could have been an orb

2672
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:06,070
shard potentially but it's for now it is

2673
02:34:06,070 --> 02:34:08,021
still unconfirmed until I will finally

2674
02:34:08,021 --> 02:34:10,271
settle down in one place I don't know

2675
02:34:10,271 --> 02:34:12,431
what will happen to wolfburg I'll do my

2676
02:34:12,431 --> 02:34:14,230
best to blur all the traces I've left

2677
02:34:14,230 --> 02:34:16,511
around the castle it can do it can as

2678
02:34:16,511 --> 02:34:18,851
well fall apart as it will not be my

2679
02:34:18,851 --> 02:34:21,761
personal matter anymore the shrine seems

2680
02:34:21,761 --> 02:34:24,190
more promising not only is it located in

2681
02:34:24,190 --> 02:34:26,080
the middle of a forest where no men dare

2682
02:34:26,080 --> 02:34:28,360
to go but it's also hidden underneath

2683
02:34:28,360 --> 02:34:30,490
the ground giving me the perfect hideout

2684
02:34:30,490 --> 02:34:32,830
from the outside world no strangers will

2685
02:34:32,830 --> 02:34:33,940
interrupt my work

2686
02:34:33,940 --> 02:34:38,700
why so fucking loud

2687
02:34:38,700 --> 02:34:41,250
maybe I'm just maybe I'm just on edge

2688
02:34:41,250 --> 02:34:45,431
but this game has just given me a little

2689
02:34:45,431 --> 02:34:48,940
bit of reason to be upsetting someone

2690
02:34:48,940 --> 02:34:52,579
give me some spaghetti

2691
02:34:52,579 --> 02:34:58,609
okay

2692
02:34:58,609 --> 02:35:03,630
what are the donations at we are at let

2693
02:35:03,630 --> 02:35:11,340
me one second we're at $31,000 we have

2694
02:35:11,340 --> 02:35:14,850
no goal by the way we have no goal

2695
02:35:14,850 --> 02:35:16,800
we've only been streaming for a few

2696
02:35:16,800 --> 02:35:20,909
hours and all I've had is annoyances and

2697
02:35:20,909 --> 02:35:23,729
terrible terrible terrible gameplay and

2698
02:35:23,729 --> 02:35:29,870
you guys have raised $31,000 that is

2699
02:35:29,870 --> 02:35:33,600
absolutely amazing thank you so much for

2700
02:35:33,600 --> 02:35:35,040
helping out with this that is

2701
02:35:35,040 --> 02:35:37,620
astonishing I just want to take a second

2702
02:35:37,620 --> 02:35:39,840
to like stop and just I know I've been

2703
02:35:39,840 --> 02:35:42,750
being goof and I know that this has been

2704
02:35:42,750 --> 02:35:44,790
like frustrating for me and everybody

2705
02:35:44,790 --> 02:35:47,909
watching but that is a shit ton of money

2706
02:35:47,909 --> 02:35:51,750
that is a stupid amount of money to just

2707
02:35:51,750 --> 02:35:54,930
suddenly rain out of the sky for a cause

2708
02:35:54,930 --> 02:35:58,109
that is really really necessary because

2709
02:35:58,109 --> 02:35:59,819
right now it's on the cusp of something

2710
02:35:59,819 --> 02:36:02,760
greater and a final cure cystic fibrosis

2711
02:36:02,760 --> 02:36:04,949
is a disease that basically just

2712
02:36:04,949 --> 02:36:07,979
destroys your lungs but with the

2713
02:36:07,979 --> 02:36:10,439
advances that we can make like we can

2714
02:36:10,439 --> 02:36:12,090
really do a lot of good and and this is

2715
02:36:12,090 --> 02:36:14,069
another thing where I don't touch any of

2716
02:36:14,069 --> 02:36:16,050
the money it goes straight to the cystic

2717
02:36:16,050 --> 02:36:19,229
fibrosis Research Institute or

2718
02:36:19,229 --> 02:36:21,659
incorporate or whatever it is like this

2719
02:36:21,659 --> 02:36:22,949

2720
02:36:22,949 --> 02:36:25,620
charities in the world and it is just a

2721
02:36:25,620 --> 02:36:26,460

inspiration for everybody out there and

3020
02:54:51,380 --> 02:54:53,030
I guess I can I don't know if I'm

3021
02:54:53,030 --> 02:54:57,700
supposed to

3022
02:54:57,700 --> 02:55:00,431
it ain't working in the UK unfortunately

3023
02:55:00,431 --> 02:55:02,590
a doesn't work outside of the u.s. at

3024
02:55:02,590 --> 02:55:05,170
this moment hopefully they will because

3025
02:55:05,170 --> 02:55:06,370
I don't know if people have been using

3026
02:55:06,370 --> 02:55:08,470
it extensively it's relatively new but

3027
02:55:08,470 --> 02:55:10,601
hopefully people will start using it

3028
02:55:10,601 --> 02:55:15,101
again in that will be good that looks

3029
02:55:15,101 --> 02:55:16,630
yeah it looks weakened that's probably

3030
02:55:16,630 --> 02:55:19,480
fine I don't know if I'm supposed to go

3031
02:55:19,480 --> 02:55:23,410
this way though yeah yes I guess I they

3032
02:55:23,410 --> 02:55:24,910
wouldn't be stupid enough just to put

3033
02:55:24,910 --> 02:55:26,410
the orb right back where it was before

3034
02:55:26,410 --> 02:55:28,780
right there wouldn't be that stupid they

3035
02:55:28,780 --> 02:55:31,660
might be stupid but they might not be

3036
02:55:31,660 --> 02:55:40,000
that stupid yeah the game could be good

3037
02:55:40,000 --> 02:55:43,590
if it wasn't just a little bit

3038
02:55:43,590 --> 02:55:46,601
cumbersome I would say that the game is

3039
02:55:46,601 --> 02:55:58,061

mean like I'm because there's there's a

3198
03:03:57,800 --> 03:04:00,230
certain element of interaction that

3199
03:04:00,230 --> 03:04:02,840
comes out of live and I know that not

3200

everyone can can be there for live

3201
03:04:04,760 --> 03:04:06,890
streams it is very time dependent and

3202
03:04:06,890 --> 03:04:08,480
that doesn't mean I would do any less in

3203
03:04:08,480 --> 03:04:11,300
terms of video production but I want to

3204
