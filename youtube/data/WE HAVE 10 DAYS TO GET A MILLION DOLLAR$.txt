1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:09,480
this this is the story of what can

2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,269
happen when the power of social media is

3
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:14,810
leveraged for something good

00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:23,200

[Applause]

6
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:38,510
I just wanna say so this all started

7
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:40,760
yesterday last night when I saw the

8
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,140
tweet from Thoreau

9
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:46,030
Scrooge idea miss Amy Butler a facin

10
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:48,110
Jerome's a good friend of mine he's like

11
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:50,360
a big social media guy but he's someone

12
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,250
who's really concentrated his efforts

13
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:55,960
and social media towards helping others

14
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,259
dominant person enough lagunas he could

15
00:01:00,259 --> 00:01:05,570
be dying to know it - what room is

16
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:06,830
talking about here is the current

17
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:08,689
humanitarian crisis taking place in

18
00:01:08,689 --> 00:01:10,970
Somalia which isn't reported on that

19
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,670
well here in the States but it is a it's

20
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:15,140
a famine that's been brought on by a

21
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,430
drought and a number of other

22
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:18,560
geopolitical issues but it's affecting

23
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,570
over 6 million people in Somalia alone

24
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:24,049
see a bit on the opposite in the way to

25
00:01:24,049 --> 00:01:25,909
comp you see do it long way yet about so

26
00:01:25,909 --> 00:01:28,220
many so he tweeted that video he

27
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,990
directed it at Turkish Airlines

28
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:31,580
specifically because they're the only

29
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:33,860
airline that flies to Somalia and and

30
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,479
then it started to pick up traction and

31
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:37,970
but my friend Jerome Jarre brought this

32
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:40,549
to my attention that he thinks we can

33
00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:43,490
all help by getting an airplane filled

34
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:46,760
with food and water to Somalia we can't

35
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,470
let this happen we have to help these

36
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:50,570
people use this hashtag get it trending

37
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:53,120
get Turkish Airlines attention and

38
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,010
quickly this started to gain traction it

39
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:57,560
started to become bigger than just your

40
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,100
own

41
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:07,330
[Music]

42
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:11,720
okay Friday night at 8:00 p.m. that's

43
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,520
when I was in front of the computer and

44
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,480
so horrible if I mean so Maya I googled

45
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,700
how to get a flight so turkey Shannon is

46
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,380
the only airlines going there I decided

47
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,640
okay we have to do something we have to

48
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,750

00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,270
food so it takes Ben hey Ben do you see

50
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:27,920
what's happening in Somalia millions of

51
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,240
people are about to die from famine just

52
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,340
like in 2011 and this is Ben Stiller the

53
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:34,040
famous actor uh-huh the original one

54
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,630
we're launching the army now to provide

55
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,520
the players then we are going to ask

56
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,020
food companies and people to donate food

57
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,340

the next day was it so wasn't easy yes

61
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,480
sure and that's how all of this came

62
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,590
together I didn't think you'd actually

63
00:02:54,590 --> 00:03:01,910
do it all right

64
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:09,170
Jerome 1ba wampa never won yeah tell me

65

the full update okay here is what's

67
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:17,660
going on but five days ago I saw an

68
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,190
article online about what's going on in

69
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:21,860
Somalia and I wasn't aware I think made

70
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,510
you haven't barely talked about it and

71
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:26,090
so there is only one airline that goes

72
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:28,070
there it's Turkish Airlines and so I

73
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:30,709
thought okay why don't we ask the

74
00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:32,360
insurance if we can use that flight and

75
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,330
fill it with food and bring bring some

76

100
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,970
cargo flight and then after that as long

101
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:49,590
as we bring food you get to make room

102
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:52,020
right somehow no matter it doesn't

103
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,570
really matter if it's a wide-body

104
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:56,099
narrow-body as long as you know we find

105
00:04:56,099 --> 00:05:00,139
space

106
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:09,720
bye-bye all right thank you guys 60 tons

107
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,090
cargo flight to fill with food for

108
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:14,659
Monday 27 that will go from Istanbul to

109
00:05:14,659 --> 00:05:18,919
Somalia and then we have an extra 140

110
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:22,380
140 tons that we can use of this space

111
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:25,020
for the next six months all right if you

112
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,789
didn't catch what has happened Turkish

113
00:05:26,789 --> 00:05:29,310
Airlines just agreed to fill up an

114
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:33,000
entire cargo plane with 60 tons that's

115
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,509
120 thousand pounds of food and relief

116
00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:39,000
to go to Somalia they also just

117
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,330
contributed another unless I'm saying

118
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:43,860
this wrong I think it's another hundred

119
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,949
and forty tons that they would put in

120
00:05:46,949 --> 00:05:49,500
there other planes that like extra space

121
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,870
to go to Somalia this thing just got

122
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:54,509
real like I just i sat there I witnessed

123
00:05:54,509 --> 00:05:57,599
it there was an idea and then a tweet

124
00:05:57,599 --> 00:05:59,190
and then the tweet turned into a

125
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:01,800
movement which became something else

126
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:08,910
that has now become action

127
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,560
very important to recognize here how big

128
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,870
of a deal it is for Turkish Airlines to

129
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:16,120
have done this this isn't a commercial

130
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,740
anything for Turkish Airlines they just

131
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:20,020
stepped up and gave no idea what the

132
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,880
cost could be that is a tremendous

133
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,890
amount of resources to give an entire

134
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:26,260
cargo plane and then plane after plane

135
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:29,050
with extra cargo space to bring relief

136
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:31,480
and for me personally look I retweeted

137
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,040
it yesterday and I saw Jerome was doing

138
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,470
this but right there when this had

139
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:36,760
happened these guys did all the heavy

140
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,070
lifting they did the hard work I offered

141
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,900
to be a part of the fundraising so

142
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,180
what's taking place now is there's a

143
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,680
GoFundMe account that's linked below

144
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,810
where they're trying we are trying to

145
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:48,880
raise all the money to pay for all the

146
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,440
supplies and infrastructure to bring all

147
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,750
of that food to Somalia Ben Stiller's

148
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,340
letting us use his charity the Stiller

149
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:56,440
foundation so all donations are

150
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,210
tax-deductible and will be managed

151
00:06:58,210 --> 00:06:59,800
appropriately you'll be able to see in

152
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,560
fact everything donate if you can I know

153
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,180
there's like a lot of bad things going

154
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,290
on in the world right now there's a lot

155
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:07,960
of things locally of concern but it's

156
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,670
but it's hard to imagine a greater

157
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,680
priority then you know millions of

158
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,210
people starving to death and knowing

159
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:15,700
that a couple bucks could impact that in

160
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,340
a positive way and then also with some

161
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:21,070
truth which is the fact that you know

162
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:22,570
there are millions of people who are

163
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:25,360
starving and struggling because of this

164
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,040
drought because of this famine not just

165
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,620
in Somalia but in Ethiopia and Kenya and

166
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:33,190
South Sudan and Sudan and Uganda these

167
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:35,350
planes and all this effort and all this

168
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:37,150
energy that's being made by this little

169
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:39,880
campaign is a drop in the hat but I

170
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,430
think a very important first step is one

171
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,050
of awareness which this seems like a

172
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:46,780
very good first step towards but there

173
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,130
are some links below if you want to

174
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:49,540
understand more of what's happening

175
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,140
there

176
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:53,110

to they're doing work all over Eastern

179
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,260
