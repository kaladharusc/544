2
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:10,349
Scrat the saber-tooth squirrel waited

3
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:12,120
until it was very much winter to find a

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,860
place to bury as one acorn also this

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,540
stupid prehistoric squirrel only has one

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,430
acorn for the winner also saber-tooth

7
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,170
squirrels never existed not off to a

8
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:20,550
good start moving how was this thing not

9
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:21,990
already dead I know it would be kind of

10
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,760
dark for this movie for kids to open on

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,619
a prehistoric squirrel carcass but I may

12
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:27,060
prefer that to teaching kids that ill

13
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:32,099
preparedness is hilarious Ruby expects

14
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:33,360
me to believe that ice cracking has a

15
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,040
similar behavior to a lit line of

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,420
gunpowder did the second glacier just

17
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:37,860
happen to be falling or did another

18
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,570
dumbass critter serendipitously cause

19
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,570
this one to fall at the same time

20
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:47,489
scratch is dead scratch is dead oh don't

21
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:51,000
really scratch is dead I mean that's

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,739
totally the end of scratch right I mean

23
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:54,570
Jesus I guess I don't have to ever worry

24
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,250
about scrap I saw a dead squirrel once

25
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,320
my God have mercy on my soul if I figure

26
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,969
out whatever monster or Toyota Camry did

27
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:02,550
it why not call it the Big Chill or the

28
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:03,780
NIP Fiero

29
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,040
because then there would be no naming

30
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,479
option for the porn parody of this movie

31
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,460
also if there are that many animals then

32
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:09,900
why the fuck wasn't Scrat immediately

33
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,729
stepped on the other 99% of the herd

34
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:13,470
seems to just appear out of nowhere how

35
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,930
do we know it's an Ice Age you wouldn't

36
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,610
for two reasons you know or anyone you

37
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,320
know would only know the world as it is

38
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,479
because an ice age lasts for thousands

39
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:22,890
of years and also these creatures are

40
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:24,360
probably experiencing a glacial period

41
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,680
within an ice age since we are

42
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,299
technically still in an ice age today

43
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:29,610
see you probably didn't know that now

44
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:30,869
you can relate to these armadillo

45
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:32,790
pig-nosed creatures no fudge

46
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,710
you can play extinction later first of

47
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:36,390
all this is incredibly morbid second of

48
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,070
all with the herd moving like it is how

49
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,360
are these kids able to break away from

50
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,829
their parents to play in this tar pit in

51
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:42,210
the first place someone sucks at

52
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:44,369
parenting if my trunk was that small I

53
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:46,439
wouldn't draw attention to myself pal

54
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,360
Manny perpetuates trunk Envy which in a

55
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,619
few thousand years will evolve it to

56
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:51,720
something else come up a mob see it is a

57
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,740
weakened by Manny's character

58
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,240
introduction and not the herd of animals

59
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,890
that has been stopping by for presumably

60
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,630
a few hours because you know the plot

61
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,000
they do this every year

62
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,890
sits family abandons him every year yet

63
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:03,450
he still manages to find them so they

64
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:04,920
can abandon him again and he doesn't

65
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,810
anticipate it for the next year isn't

66
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,539
there anyone who cares about shit the

67
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:12,120
sloth Sid says his name in species while

68
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,860
talking to himself because nuance

69
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,370
position is for suckers ah that creature

70
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,780
that walks by must have some powerful

71
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,340
butthole in order to shoot his fecal

72
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,570
matter to that location because I

73
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:23,280
watched him scuttle by that spot and he

74
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,170
did not defecate I can't believe it

75
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:27,630
fresh wild greens these Rhino creatures

76
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:28,680
don't seem to be too worried about

77
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,240
migrating with the herd which is great

78
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,710
because now their available tool easily

79
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,120
manufacture some conflict I'll

80
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,530
double-check but I'm pretty sure this is

81
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:35,850
the first children's movie to ever have

82
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,380
literally splattered on a characters

83
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,690
face now even though these rhinos are

84
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:41,220
super pissed off they feel the need to

85
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,270
give the sloth a head start

86
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:44,070
don't let them in tell me they have very

87
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:45,600
long fingernails that I didn't see if

88
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,860
not I don't know how they will impale

89
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,240
him with a flat shovel and a wishbone

90
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,100
four horns if either of you make it

91
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,230
across that sinkhole in front of you you

92
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,670
get the sloth why would they even be

93
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,170
remotely concerned that this is actually

94
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:56,910
a sinkhole Sid literally just ran over

95
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,170
it when there's plenty of room for them

96
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,270
to just walk around the not sinkhole how

97
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:02,630
do they think Manny got over their

[Music]

99
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:09,780
symbol you and me two bachelors knocking

100
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,060
about in that wild I guess at the blue

101

sky pitch meeting for this movie Michael

102
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:15,540
Wilson just said remember last year when

103
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,880
DreamWorks did Trek let's do that and we

104
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,160
can teach kids bad science win-win this

105
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,660
sloth is pretty fast they probably

106
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,860
should have just made him a fictional

107
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,239
prehistoric ferret or something instead

108
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:25,470
of making him a notoriously slow

109
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,330
creature that moves normally the mammoth

110
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:29,070
is Manny the mammoth this must be Percy

111
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:31,320
the person also collars hats these

112
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,549
Paleolithic people are very

113
00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:34,410
fashion-forward tightly tied my hands

114
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:36,090
and feet and they gag me with a field

115
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,040
mouse and barricade the cave door and

116
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,810
covered their tracks went to water so

117
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:41,790
I'd lose a Centon after all that sit was

118
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:42,570
able to find them again

119
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:44,310
his entire family must be as dumb as he

120
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,570
is force it to be able to track them

121
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:46,590
down after they went through all that

122
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,420
trouble also if they did all that last

123
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,950
year then why the hell did sits family

124
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:51,660
just leave without doing anything to him

125
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,010
this year and why the because this year

126
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:54,390
the year he loses his family for good

127
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:55,769
nanny is able to turn around in a

128
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:57,390
shelter even though there was no way you

129
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,830
could actually do that well almost

130
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:00,360
nothing has happened so far time for

131
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,480
scratch it's really saying something

132
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,830
when the most memorable parts of your

133
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,330
movie are the little transitional scenes

134
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,680
with a squirrel that have nothing to do

135
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,260
with the actual plot of the movie how

136
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,610
did you not see or hear the mom

137
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:12,930
approaching an attempt there seemed to

138
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,280
only be four men in this camp which

139
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,480
might be a problem if there weren't just

140
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,430
four saber-toothed cats it's literally

141
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:18,930
unbelievable this saber-toothed tiger

142
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:20,130
hasn't caught up to this woman running

143
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,680
with a baby yet and

144
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,910
you picked this hair off my shoulder and

145
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:24,380
says look if you're gonna have an extra

146
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,539
mating dance at least pick a female with

147
00:04:26,539 --> 00:04:28,430
the same color powder that's racist the

148
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:29,690
director said let's have your character

149
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:30,919
eat an apple it'll make him look like

150
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:32,660
even more of an asshole okay she's a lot

151
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,370
but the baby is definitely dead up the

152
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,229
the baby survived that fall and

153
00:04:36,229 --> 00:04:37,820
subsequent turning of the waterfall Nana

154
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,410
the human understanding listen very

155
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:44,960
carefully I'm not going any enunciates

156
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,600
through his nose hi I'm fine I'm gonna

157
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,150
die seems like an unnecessary way to get

158
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,560
this child back to its people even

159
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,699
though it would take longer they could

160
00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:55,310
just walk baby giggles through a

161
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,870
perilous situation cliche what kind of

162
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,190
bullshit is this you mean he's somehow

163
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,830
track where the baby was downriver

164
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:02,419
literal slapstick well unless you know

165
00:05:02,419 --> 00:05:04,160
how to track you're never gonna reach

166
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,020
them before the pass closes up with snow

167
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,550
why is knowing how to track a factor

168
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:08,930
Mandy just pointed to where they need to

169
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:10,639
go slight seems to be the only necessary

170
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,009
treat for this journey would tag you I

171
00:05:13,009 --> 00:05:16,729
said tigey YG's gonna lead the way Manny

172
00:05:16,729 --> 00:05:18,169
with holds as planned which creates this

173
00:05:18,169 --> 00:05:19,580
awkward moment that I think is supposed

174
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,289
to be funny I suggest you watch your

175
00:05:21,289 --> 00:05:23,810
back cuz I'll be chewing on it watching

176
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:25,160
it won't do much good at that point

177
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,690
I've eaten things that didn't complain

178
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:28,130
as much I would hope that the things

179
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:29,840
Diego eats wouldn't complain because

180
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,789
they would be already dead Hey wearing

181
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:33,349
one of the baby thing is Manny has a

182
00:05:33,349 --> 00:05:34,639
pretty solid grasp of the English

183
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,020
language but doesn't know the word

184
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,240
diaper check for poop I think the entire

185
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,560
screenplay was written around this one

186
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,510
line hey Bill did we animate any

187
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,099
characters getting on their face not

188
00:05:43,099 --> 00:05:44,479
sure Tom but I throw some on the mammoth

189
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,690
just in case tweed there was no way that

190
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:49,610
was clean he clearly hasn't been changed

191
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:50,599
in over 24 hours

192
00:05:50,599 --> 00:05:52,490
Disney very famously animates characters

193
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,259
to be as cute as possible Fox on the

194
00:05:54,259 --> 00:05:58,449
other hand is like NAT where's the baby

195
00:05:58,449 --> 00:06:01,310
there is is peekaboo a game that

196
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:03,139
saber-tooth cats commonly play I don't

197
00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:04,460
remember seeing that at the Museum of

198
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,060
Natural History

199
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,070
I bet he's hungry how are they not all

200
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,509
hungry I don't think any of them have

201
00:06:08,509 --> 00:06:09,110
eaten in days

202
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,880
Dodos were not anywhere near in North

203
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,440
America they were pretty much stuck on

204
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,820
one island in the Indian Ocean

205
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,620
also 99% of the species that have

206
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,449
existed on earth are extinct yet the

207
00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:18,860
dodo has this reputation for being

208
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:19,699
insanely stupid

209
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:21,560
mammoths are extent also but mani isn't

210
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,030
hopping around acting like a fool hey

211
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:24,860
can we have our melon back since when

212
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,910
was this every year melon

213
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:28,990
how that they all know at the same time

214
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:29,950
that Sid was trying to steal another

215
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,720
melon they might be done but they have a

216
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,100
keen sense of when someone is touching

217
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,450
their melons this watermelon dodo

218
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:35,980
sequence with its music and madcap

219
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,360
hijinks feels like it should be

220
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,770
delightful but it's not

221
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:42,430
I said Diego has no idea how watermelons

222
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:44,890
work a shelf all CID is full from eating

223
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:46,330
a little bit of watermelon after not

224
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:48,280
eating for an extended time Diego can

225
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,510
smell when someone is finally going to

226
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,400
sleep apparently dragging down helpless

227
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,620
infants too difficult for you so they've

228
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,910
been following them this whole time or

229
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:56,350
did the movie just a sign for them to

230
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,550
operate here so they could have this

231
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,080
conversation that reminds us that Diego

232
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,130
is still a bad guy

233
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:02,440
Soto's getting tired of waiting why

234
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,760
can't Soto hunt down this baby by

235
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,169
himself I'll never understand these

236
00:07:05,169 --> 00:07:06,820
villains who really want something then

237
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,169
leave it up to others to get it for them

238
00:07:08,169 --> 00:07:09,790
Sid and the floozies use a tar pit a

239
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:11,320
natural phenomenon that notoriously

240
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,940
trapped and killed prehistoric animals

241
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,830
as a Jacuzzi also the whole point of

242
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,120
this movie is that Sid got left behind

243
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,830
and Manny decided not to migrate with

244
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,419
the rest of the animals so how the kid

245
00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:21,100
Sid run into two female sloths in this

246
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,960
general vicinity baby's eyes have tar

247
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,000
repellent powers also the baby would

248
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,320
totally be dead at this point and

249
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,610
Sidney's lady friends would be close

250
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:27,940
behind

251
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:30,910
nanny I need him to do what exactly they

252
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:32,380
already know you have him his presence

253
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,370
would just be awkward of your

254
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:34,720
relationship with these sloth women went

255
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,010
any further how did these rhinos

256
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:37,750
suddenly show up out of the blue having

257
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,190
our heroes traveled some distance and

258
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:40,390
some terrain that would be impossible

259
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:42,100
for these assholes to suddenly happen

260
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,690
upon their camp hey hey does this look

261
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,850
like a petting zoo to you hey hey have

262
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:47,680
you ever seen a petting zoo or zoo

263
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,540
period three two one

264
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:54,580
sure is faithful what could sit choose

265
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,200
to lay here I guess it was the only

266
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,610
feasible way to reveal that this is Old

267
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:59,110
Faithful giving us context of their

268
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:00,640
location even though that completely

269
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,900
screws with the fact that we saw dodo

270
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,640
birds earlier who were indigenous to the

271
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,310
islands in the Indian Ocean the Sid

272
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:07,780
picks up a somehow already completed

273
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:10,240
snowball modern architecture Manny knows

274
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,590
about architecture but he doesn't know

275
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:13,240
about diapers during the Ice Age snow

276
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,770
didn't stick to animal fur who knew

277
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:16,810
Diego wastes his time by covering up a

278
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:18,130
footprint that he could claim as his own

279
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,870
and then waste his time some more by

280
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,400
making the single four toad human

281
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,110
footprint in the snow because fake

282
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,550
seeing a lone human footprint in the

283
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:26,110
snow doesn't immediately raise suspicion

284
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:27,880
you know because prehistoric humans have

285
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,680
such epically long strides aren't they

286
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,430
on a time crunch

287
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:32,320
didn't someone say earlier well unless

288
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,210
you know how to track you're never going

289
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:35,860
to reach them before the pass closes up

290
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:36,520
with snow

291
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,229
yeah they decided to take this time to

292
00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:39,910
ice-skate where the hell is the thrush

293
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:41,230
hold on an animal being able to speak

294
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,910
English or can the squirrel actually

295
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:44,410
speak English but he just prefers to

296
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:45,400
communicate with charades

297
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,960
because he knows charades just as well

298
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,190
as the rest of our characters can speak

299
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:50,310
English it knows he uh pachyderm

300
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:52,150
backslap many designs to be as

301
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,950
unobservant as sid in this moment based

302
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,450
on his Anatomy making and throwing a

303
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:56,770
snowball should be very difficult for

304
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:58,210
Manny yep he is able to produce and

305
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:00,040
throw this Boulder sized snowball move

306
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:04,420
sloth movie perpetuates myth that slight

307
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,160
yelling can cause large sheets of ice to

308
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,600
crumble the group is concerned about the

309
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,070
chandelier of icicles even though the

310
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:10,750
area they are standing in is this big

311
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,280
the ice from earlier looks a lot like

312
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,840
rocks now it was nice of this cave to

313
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,100
freeze in the shape of a Natural History

314
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,990
Museum also aren't we going to do a

315
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,760
whole dawn of the dinosaurs story later

316
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,740
who the hell is this guy hey nice sloth

317
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,600
evolutionary chart I wonder who's alive

318
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,100
millions of years to collect all these

319
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:27,790
guys and piece this all together movie

320
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,050
goes to the trouble to reference Star

321
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:30,700
Trek but gives us a generic ass flying

322
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,350
saucer instead of any of the thousands

323
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:33,940
of ships in that universe as reference

324
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,010
isn't the baby ahead of them look what

325
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:37,750
the baby survived the room of ice spikes

326
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,820
also it's convenient that this ice froze

327
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,590
and a fun slide formation manny is

328
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:42,850
behind the baby when he launches into

329
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,500
the air and then suddenly he's in front

330
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,580
of the baby so he could be calm

331
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:48,130
who's up for out - Diego stole SIDS line

332
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:50,140
or maybe SIDS irritating demeanor is

333
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,940
like an airborne illness Manny is almost

334
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,800
to the exit of the cave then in no time

335
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,360
he's back with San Diego looking at the

336
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:55,780
painting

337
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,850
Manny may secretly be the fastest animal

338
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:59,170
in whatever fantasy version of the world

339
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:01,120
they are a backstory cave painting they

340
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,140
would have just done a standard

341
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,340
flashback but that would be too

342
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,270
expensive to animate

343
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,800
yeah but put this scenario to occur

344
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,940
Manny would have to live in a world

345
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,710
where death is possible did Diego and

346
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:10,660
Sid see that animation also they seem to

347
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,670
know why Manny is upset did the cape men

348
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:14,350
draw a touching portrait of a loving

349
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,880
mammoth family before killing two-thirds

350
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,130
of it that's some dark man hypothermia

351
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:19,690
must be completely psychological because

352
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:21,760
Percy here seems just fun also was it

353
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,350
not possible for this era of man to grow

354
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,970
a full beard because I feel like the

355
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:26,440
five o'clock shadow look isn't entirely

356
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,060
plausible here and I guess I just

357
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,080
couldn't get through this without a

358
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,940
volcano erupting huh it's like roland

359
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,410
emmerich or the ten robots who copied

360
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:34,180
roland emmerich on san andreas consulted

361
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,710
on this movie i'm able to look past some

362
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,210
of the scientific inaccuracies of this

363
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:38,650
movie but the last time I checked the

364
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:40,300
melting point of ice is significantly

365
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,890
lower than the melting point of rocks if

366
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:43,540
the rocks are hot enough to be lava how

367
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,130
the because there any ice anywhere near

368
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:46,270
it and I'm starting to think the

369
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,440
animators of this movie did their

370
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,180
research by playing the Bowser levels of

371
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:49,840
Super Mario

372
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,370
Manny's trunk was extended as far as it

373
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:53,050
could go but it still has enough length

374
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:53,769
to reach out

375
00:10:53,769 --> 00:10:56,110
for Diego as he's falling down and has

376
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:57,850
enough strength to grab a freaking tiger

377
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:59,350
out of midair convenient and possibly

378
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:01,509
life-saving Kaiser is convenient no one

379
00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:03,819
touches the mammoth until I get that

380
00:11:03,819 --> 00:11:05,949
baby it's going to be a lot easier for

381
00:11:05,949 --> 00:11:07,089
them to get the baby if the mammoth

382
00:11:07,089 --> 00:11:10,600
isn't in the way you can still eat it as

383
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,819
popcorn why is this bad really how can

384
00:11:12,819 --> 00:11:14,259
he keep the skis on while he walked I

385
00:11:14,259 --> 00:11:15,730
was he able to jump out of the snow with

386
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:17,259
two sticks on his legs I thought this

387
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:18,519
movie wasn't drying the whole time but

388
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:20,319
now I really know what not trying looks

389
00:11:20,319 --> 00:11:24,999
like just just this whole part Sid

390
00:11:24,999 --> 00:11:26,319
brings the baby over to where he knows

391
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:28,089
the Sabres are they are starving but

392
00:11:28,089 --> 00:11:29,470
they just saw the mammoth get lucky and

393
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:31,089
kill their leader with some icicles and

394
00:11:31,089 --> 00:11:32,379
they don't want to chance it because who

395
00:11:32,379 --> 00:11:34,059
knows if there are more icicles between

396
00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:35,350
this moment in the moment earlier with

397
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:37,089
the impossible lava river movie has one

398
00:11:37,089 --> 00:11:38,619
too many death fake-out scenes the

399
00:11:38,619 --> 00:11:39,850
speedy seems to know what's going on

400
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:41,290
this tense moment is brought to you by

401
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:43,569
no king reason why would you hide the

402
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:44,860
baby and allow a hundred time to kill

403
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,329
you before you made your dramatic reveal

404
00:11:46,329 --> 00:11:48,459
I mean come on seriously

405
00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:50,649
I've seen this woolly mammoth talk have

406
00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:52,179
human emotions and have the capacity to

407
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:53,709
solve problems and it still might be the

408
00:11:53,709 --> 00:11:54,939
stupidest fooling the mammoth that has

409
00:11:54,939 --> 00:11:55,569
ever lived

410
00:11:55,569 --> 00:11:57,579
yeah stop he's just making a dramatic

411
00:11:57,579 --> 00:12:00,069
reveal of my baby we are fools none of

412
00:12:00,069 --> 00:12:01,569
the humans are surprised that the sloth

413
00:12:01,569 --> 00:12:03,279
can pick up and hug a baby like a person

414
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,499
also interspecies hugging okay see these

415
00:12:05,499 --> 00:12:06,910
happy humans walking in the distance

416
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,740
here now the baby plays peekaboo and

417
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,629
sits somehow sees it fun but the sin

418
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:12,160
here is after another 20 seconds of

419
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,319
walking can Diego can see it too you

420
00:12:14,319 --> 00:12:16,179
know humans can't talk yeah but at least

421
00:12:16,179 --> 00:12:17,740
we actually learn how to talk you and

422
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:21,790
your ancestors never do

423
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,470
blue sky I paint for this fucking song

424
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:24,820
so they are gonna get their money's

425
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,290
worth even if this piece of ice with

426
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:28,270
Scrat in it broke off very recently how

427
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,560
could it survive that long in the

428
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,690
tropics

429
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:33,250
that's not how deserted islands work we

430
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,779
spend two minutes with this fucking rat

431
00:12:34,779 --> 00:12:40,440
even though the movie has already ended

432
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:45,150
I'm ridiculous lack of elastic today

433
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:54,890
