57
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:11,820
their daughter to the airport as she's

58
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,620
about to leave for Peru that would in

59
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,570
turn explain their sadness as this is

60
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,890
the first Christmas they'll have to

61
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:18,600
spend without her in a classic syndrome

62
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,910
of the empty nest it should be okay to

63
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:23,970

64
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,680

pistachios

84
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:16,580
Tim's dirty-ass is about to go through

85
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,380
the wash and that's basically where

86
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,790
we're at with this film hey but at least

87
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,380
we get to see Tim Allen do the funny

88
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:27,200
face getting wet is annoying you could

89
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,230
use an umbrella states of white

90
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:34,700
chocolate good point Tim you think it's

91
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,160
a white chocolate oh my god the flow of

92
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,500
this movie is like pulling teeth you get

93
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,120
any hit the white chocolate Tim that's

94
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,530
all you went in there to get how'd you

95
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:44,150
screw that up who would even bother to

96
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,310
write this exchange it's so mundane well

97
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,930
five minutes in all we've been talking

98
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,730
about specials and white chocolate their

99
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:51,470
cadence is so slow and they just keep

100
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,590
repeating the same things over and over

101
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:55,280
agnostic Briella

102
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,640
did you talk to Rex who's rich who's Rex

103
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:02,960
come on tell us the butcher the butcher

104
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,150
as odd as it sounds I didn't think of

105
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:07,190
asking the butcher where the chocolate

106
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:10,490
was so basically thus far this is a

107
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:12,380
jaded couple arguing in a low-energy and

108
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,360
passive aggressive manner the Christmas

109
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,730
film god bless I'll go talk to Rex right

110
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:19,310
now maybe he'll wonder why I'm all wet

111
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,840
you know I don't want what are you

112
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,950
stupid brother

113
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,120
Timber I can't say I'm not upset this

114
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,800
easily could have been jungle three

115
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,510
jungle had you just gone naked daughter

116
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:32,800
on the airplane huge missed opportunity

117
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,450
because Tim's character Luthor is so

118
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:38,030
upset by The Annoying Christmas season

119
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,620
he devises a plan to skip it all

120
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:42,060
together to go on a pleasure cruise

121

[Music]

122
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,340
fuck Christmas I'd rather trick my own

123
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,719
urine and celebrate Christmas thanks for

124
00:05:47,719 --> 00:05:48,919
coming watches Chris smoother this

125
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:51,319
everyone have a grand old time the first

126
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:54,710
time in 23 years Blair won't be here a

127
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:56,240
lot of depression at Christmas you know

128
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,520
tell me about it after you to whole

129
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,840
bottle of Prozac just to get through the

130
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:06,050
second part of the month we just love to

131
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:10,810
forget about it what are you looking at

132
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:15,979
why are you looking like that if you

133
00:06:15,979 --> 00:06:18,139
keep doing that I'm gonna have to call

134
00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:18,770
the police

135
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:22,069
I think it's a former harassment if Tim

136
00:06:22,069 --> 00:06:24,050
Allen looks to you like this I think

137
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,580
we're gonna need legislation is probably

138
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:26,419
gonna fix itself

139
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:28,189
Tim's rape stares apparently worked our

140
00:06:28,189 --> 00:06:30,199
usual magic as Jamie Lee Curtis gets all

141
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:31,340
hot and bothered she wants to make

142
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:34,370
whoopee right there on the table not

143
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:36,050
even Saturday night it's not even

144
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:37,849
Saturday night you know the night we

145
00:06:37,849 --> 00:06:39,259
literally apparently schedule having

146
00:06:39,259 --> 00:06:41,089
violent sex on the dining room table

147
00:06:41,089 --> 00:06:44,180
have an idea yeah just let it be known

148
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,520
that I never asked to see Jamie Lee

149
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,009
Curtis that truly sexually aroused by

150
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:51,469
Tim Allen yeah but but I got it anyway

151
00:06:51,469 --> 00:06:53,779
hey careful what you wish for is we st.

152
00:06:53,779 --> 00:06:57,589
keV what's da wish for yeah that are you

153
00:06:57,589 --> 00:06:59,689
doing it snap apparently though Luther

154
00:06:59,689 --> 00:07:01,460
didn't add the hanky-panky in mind as he

155
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,139
was just excited to reveal his genius

156
00:07:03,139 --> 00:07:04,909
scheme to skip out on Christmas and go

157
00:07:04,909 --> 00:07:06,710
on the cruise he's so horny at the idea

158
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:08,089
of fucking off he tells her to fuck off

159
00:07:08,089 --> 00:07:09,919
it's nah but nothing tonight Jesus

160
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,229
Christ man let her down easy we spent

161
00:07:12,229 --> 00:07:14,599
six thousand $100 on Christmas list with

162
00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:16,069
precious little to show for Luther

163
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:17,629
explains that the previous year they

164
00:07:17,629 --> 00:07:19,310
spent over six thousand dollars on the

165
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,169
holiday season he argues that they may

166
00:07:21,169 --> 00:07:22,639
as well use the funds this year for a

167
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,259
vacation to the Caribbean and skip out

168
00:07:24,259 --> 00:07:26,240
on the whole process altogether actually

169
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,620
saving money in the process

170
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,539
it's like I said first thing about

171
00:07:29,539 --> 00:07:31,520
Christmas having to sit there and do

172
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,919
Christmas huh Wow our boring stinker

173
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:38,020
that is my goddamn eggnog

174
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:41,120
joke's on you stupid bird eggnog is

175
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,160
poisonous to birds for various reasons

176
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,530
we skip Christmas well we can still give

177
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:47,720
our charitable donations to Children's

178
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,280
Hospital and and of course the church

179
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,780
now this is where things start to get

180
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,520
weird I'm not sure if the writers were

181
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,870
just out of touch or trying to get the

182
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,550
target demographic of 75 year old

183
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:57,110
couples from the Midwest because just

184
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,090
after Nora's sexy episode she starts to

185
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:00,650
make a big stink that she can't go on

186
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:01,850
the cruise unless they make a donation

187
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:04,070
to the church you're gonna let a lousy

188
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:06,380
600 bucks stand between us and a

189
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:10,670
Caribbean cruise no you are alright

190
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:12,410
alright look I'll match last year's

191
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:14,570
contribution to the church into the

192
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:17,240
hospital but not a penny more oh thank

193
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,400
God the church matching contribution to

194
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,020
the church can't leave without that glad

195
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,910
we resolved that plot point in literally

196
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:25,160
20 seconds between two scenes I think

197
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,990
this movie might just be a web cam live

198
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:32,420
feed of a real couples life night then

199
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:33,830
of course like a normal person

200
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,600
Tim's character walks around his office

201
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,430
handing Flyers to everyone notifying

202
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:38,960
them that he's skipping Christmas

203
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,700
because as we know in real life

204
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,010
Christmas is mandated by law and anyone

205
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:44,540
who fails to comply is an enemy of the

206
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,550
state who would do this why would anyone

207
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:48,470
care no one cares if you leave on

208
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:51,650
Christmas I'm letting you know that I'll

209
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:58,630
be skipping Christmas this year go ahead

210
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:00,570
run

211
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:03,300
but we will find you but yeah that's

212
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,980
basically the whole story of this film

213
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,810
that everyone surrounding the cranks is

214
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:08,460
so concerned with them skipping out on

215
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,050
Christmas they get socially ostracized

216
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,850
like they're living in Victorian England

217
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:13,710
or something so what would happen if

218
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:15,150
someone just literally needed to leave

219
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,860
town for Christmas this is so out of

220
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,090
touch it leaves the realm of

221
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,160
plausibility mrs. Krank we've got to

222
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,050
talk about your Christmas invitations um

223
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:24,600
no no party this year no party no

224
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,970
Christmas Eve party she's not ordering

225
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:29,250
Christmas cards either indeed and a hit

226
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,570
a rumor she's having a baby out of

227
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,360
wedlock as well I'm whining about the

228
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,490
party anyway because we don't want to

229
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:38,640
marry yeah I think it's about time to

230
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,440
move to a new town and change your name

231
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,480
so the cranks proceeded to go around

232
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,640
town needlessly pissing everyone off who

233
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,870
is apparently part of their yearly

234
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:48,300
holiday routine yeah Canadian blue

235
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,370
spruce last year this one's a real

236
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:53,370
beauty almost 10 feet tall this is Frank

237
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:58,080
likes the big ones we're not buying a

238
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,810
Christmas tree this year

239
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:02,940
are we had to go up on the price we're

240
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,250
making less per tree than last year it's

241
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,230
not about the money we're not doing

242
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:09,120
Christmas this year we're gonna go away

243
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,640
on a cruise we don't need a tree yeah

244
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,960
how do you like dead you little punk

245
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,310
trying to make a decent living for

246
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:15,840
yourself while making my life joyous

247
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,690
warm and convenient I think your fucking

248
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:22,710
tree how's this for a Merry Christmas

249
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:24,180
you bunch of young innocent children

250
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,380
trying to foster a loving community

251
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,360
spirit it's really a movie about the

252
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,920
spirit of the holidays you know really

253
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,000
looking forward to the Santa Claus for

254
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,440
want to know what happens in that one

255
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,490
don't know why they haven't made that

256
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:34,350
one yet at this point basically the

257
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:36,240
cranks are neighborhood enemy number one

258
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,070
and if pissed off just about everyone

259
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,360
because they're not staying in line with

260
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,830
traditions because after all the

261
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:42,330
holidays truly are about crippling

262
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:44,040
communistic style conformity aren't they

263
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,350
dan Aykroyd is in this film too for some

264
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,910
reason and he becomes upset with them

265
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,350
because they won't put their giant

266
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:51,510
Frosty the Snowman sculpture up which

267
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,880
apparently every single person in this

268
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,830
neighborhood is required to do the same

269
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:58,170
exact one what is this some sort of

270
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:00,390
cultish ritual

271
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:03,810
hmm gonna as someone gonna say something

272
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:08,730
here perfect time to put up frosty tell

273
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:13,110
you what truth is I'm gonna yeah you

274
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:14,550
know this movie was better as a horror

275
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:22,350
anyway it was an accident what the

276
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:25,019
cattle grow new spine who cares I think

277
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:26,850
this movie may actually be a masterpiece

278
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:28,200
you know it's got an American Psycho

279
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,640
thing going on it's as if the

280
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,950
protagonist is actually the antagonist

281
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:33,329
and you just find that out as the movie

282
00:11:33,329 --> 00:11:35,820
goes on it's brilliant really Luther is

283
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,220
just the most irredeemably horrible

284
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,140
person of all time but the way the film

285
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,850
portrays it you think the writers would

286
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:43,470
want you to sympathize with his plight

287
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:44,880
but then as Nora tries to leave the

288
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,620
neighborhood the conformist Nazis in her

289
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,420
town try to physically force her to give

290
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,130
up the snowman they want from her slowly

291
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:51,660
turning the movie into a Mike Meyers

292
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,339
nightmare and what I can only assume is

293
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:59,560
a throwback to curtis's earlier works

294
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,720
don't do anything you'll regret now

295
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,280
please look it's okay because shortly

296
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,870
thereafter Tim shows off colorful

297
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:07,540
underwear in his local Irish pub woman's

298
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,650
bathing suit nope

299
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:11,980
not my own I don't that I just I don't

300
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,330
really know but at this point I'm numb

301
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:15,880
to it there's no way we are wearing

302
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,070
these on this cruise these aren't for

303
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:21,000
the cruise

304
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,720
then what are they for - what are they

305
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,530
for you know it's odd does when an Irish

306
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:31,530
pub serves fish tacos I don't get that

307
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:33,150
you're a simple man aren't you

308
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,830
apparently Luther got the bathing suits

309
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:37,230
to go to a tanning parlor pre cruise so

310
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:39,210
they could look you know their best for

311
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:41,460
the cruise nor on the other hand is

312
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,680
apprehensive dear god this should be

313
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:50,250
outlawed feeling it feeling I know how

314
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,110
to feel and then of course Nora's local

315
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,460
pastor shows up to see your naked

316
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:59,500
boobies as one does because comedy

317
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,060
back at home Luther brings in the local

318
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,860
paper to show Nora and they've made

319
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,990
front page because apparently the only

320
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:07,460
thing this town has to worry about is

321
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,800
what the cranks are up to but this this

322
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,870
is the final straw for Nora as if the

323
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,760
Orwellian nightmare she's been living in

324
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,290
wasn't enough she decides to throw two

325
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:16,910
fingers up and enjoy the idea of the

326
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:22,460
crews after all oh sorry I'm late the

327
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:27,269
cancers back third time

328
00:13:27,269 --> 00:13:30,509
what is this bombshell about cancer what

329
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:32,819
is this movie a comedy drama horror

330
00:13:32,819 --> 00:13:34,550
satire undiscovered Shakespearian

331
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:36,869
classic the tone of the movie is never

332
00:13:36,869 --> 00:13:38,550
consistent one minute it's goofy the

333
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:41,009
next minute is terminal illness how do

334
00:13:41,009 --> 00:13:43,319
you think this photographer got the shot

335
00:13:43,319 --> 00:13:47,610
well he climbed up on your roof yeah why

336
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:51,720
did you do that I don't know Walt I just

337
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,399
heard about Bev I'm so sorry

338
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:58,800
how's she doing remarkably well

339
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,990
yelling good spirit if there's anything

340
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:04,470
we can do let me know thanks I really

341
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:08,279
appreciate ya I'm very deeply truly

342
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:10,970
deeply sorry about the cancer diagnosis

343
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:13,170
this is the best film ever made folks is

344
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:14,790
just that simple so at this point the

345
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,559
film takes a turn as Luther enorus

346
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:17,850
daughter who left for Peru at the

347
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:19,259
beginning of the movie calls and says

348
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:20,910
she'll be making a return for Christmas

349
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,379
with her new fiance after all

350
00:14:22,379 --> 00:14:24,269
boiling Luther's plans of the trip the

351
00:14:24,269 --> 00:14:26,009
next bulk of the film is just slapstick

352
00:14:26,009 --> 00:14:27,809
nonsense of them scrambling to get ready

353
00:14:27,809 --> 00:14:29,040
for the Christmas party they weren't

354
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,839
ready for and it even includes a funny

355
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:36,029
ham gag and real child abuse don't hurt

356
00:14:36,029 --> 00:14:37,559
that child Tim you still have another 30

357
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:38,910
years of Christmas films to make you

358
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,410
can't make him in jail unless you're

359
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:41,699
making Christmas with the Kranks too

360
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:44,069
Luther gets a perforated rectum don't be

361
00:14:44,069 --> 00:14:45,269
silly Tim leave that child alone for

362
00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:48,250
your own good

363
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:55,680
[Music]

364
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:01,760
I actually was the suicide attempts ah

365
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,040
but then in the twist of faith like one

366
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,390
hour in the movie actually starts to

367
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:07,740
pick up a bit and feels like a real

368
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,570
holiday film as a bigger twist and

369
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:11,520
Shyamalan could ever cooked up a true

370
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,890
Christmas miracle all right people

371
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:15,570
listen up gather round

372
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:18,420
we're about to have a party here at the

373
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:21,690
Kranks a Christmas homecoming for Blair

374
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:23,310
Town sees that the cranks need help

375
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:24,360
because they can't get their party

376
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,040
together in time so they all pitch in to

377
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,450
get supplies together before the

378
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:29,250
daughter's plane lands it's kind of nice

379
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,630
actually and reminds me of the best

380
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:33,060
parts of Christmas films in general hold

381
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:36,690
on why should we do this for him sure

382
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:39,540
and good things never last like this

383
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:45,390
pants but we're a community the people

384
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:46,800
in the community stick together

385
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,420
even if one of them has been behaving

386
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,520
for most of the holiday season like a

387
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,280
spoiled selfish little baby why should

388
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,440
the daughter pay for the sins of the

389
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,330
father Christmas is about giving and

390
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:59,910
family and love except for to some

391
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,320
people who I would rather be in a mass

392
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,450
grave whose name rhymes with BIM R Allen

393
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:05,460
but yeah beyond my wildest expectation I

394
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,930
actually found myself enjoying this

395
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:08,520
final part of the film I think it

396
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,380
captures the Christmas spirit perfectly

397
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,390
even if by accident the police even help

398
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:13,860
out too by picking Blair up from the

399
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,240
airport and bringing her home just in

400
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,620
time Luther makes amends with his

401
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,270
neighbors and redeems himself by giving

402
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,620
them the cruise tickets he now won't be

403
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,940
using because he'll be spending the

404
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:24,540
holidays with family hey hey this mean

405
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,890
we have to start being nice to each

406
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:26,900
other

407
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:31,950
course not good cuz I still don't like

408
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,330
you that much cold man

409
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:34,710
that's kind of fucked up dude he just

410
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:36,630
gave me the tickets then just before

411
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,130
things are about to wrap up a robber

412
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,690
that snuck into the party attempts to

413
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:41,250
steal jewelry from the cranks and make a

414
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,870
getaway

415
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:44,920

00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:57,620
back you know what they say if you show

419
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,209
an umbrella in the first act you don't

420
00:16:59,209 --> 00:17:00,800
use it by the third you haven't written

421
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,069
to Tim Allen film you're the guy that

422
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:06,079
was selling umbrellas in the rain it's a

423
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,150
living thank you for the party hey

424
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:09,439
you're welcome I'm sorry you got to work

425
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,260
on Christmas Eve Santa always has to

426
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,089
work on Christmas Eve

427
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:19,819
it's the real Santa isn't it it's the

428
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:23,510
real Santa praise Jesus and there it is

429
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:25,339
the film ends on a nice little note well

430
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:26,929
in some aspects it's one of the most

431
00:17:26,929 --> 00:17:29,299
tone-deaf films I've ever seen there's

432
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:31,160
just something lovable about it just the

433
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,169
fact that no one in this entire movie

434
00:17:33,169 --> 00:17:34,549
seems like they want to be there yet

435
00:17:34,549 --> 00:17:36,440
somehow it turns out all right in the

436
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,330
end and isn't that at the end of the day

437
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:39,980
what the holidays are all about being

438
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,179
forced to be with a bunch of people

439
00:17:41,179 --> 00:17:43,190
you're only lukewarm on for long periods

440
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:46,370
of time hey in my eyes it's perfect so

441
