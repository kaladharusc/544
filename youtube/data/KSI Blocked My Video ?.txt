00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:14,190
MINECRAFT it's a lot / this the

4
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:15,509
parentheses whatever the hell they're

5

6
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,900

7
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,580
know distract I watched chaos eyes I

8
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,429
watched chaos eyes dis track Adams dis

9
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:34,160
track now it got blocked worldwide

10
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:42,899
because but isn't that nice its Adam's

11
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:45,510

behalf of Island Records blocks in all

13
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:54,870
countries this video had four hundred

14
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:59,100
and twelve thousand views quite a lot

15
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,559
quite quite quite a lot so I'm a little

16
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:05,400
upset it got blocked just because it's

17
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,770
like you know it reached out to a lot of

18
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,780
people and I had a message basically in

19
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,780
that video why is it blocked you may ask

20
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,790
all right here right here so he tweeted

21
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:22,530
out what was it three days ago September

22
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:27,479
22nd if your video has been claimed that

23
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:29,759
involves any of my music in the EP

24
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,950
coming out next week I'm sorry I have no

25
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,810
control of the matter as some of you

26
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,939
know I sang day three EP deal with

27
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:37,799
Island Records and this will be my final

28
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:39,540
release before I go independent at this

29
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:40,979
point any music I make after that we'll

30
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:42,240
be fine using videos again I'm sorry

31
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,020
that but that's just how a label works

32
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:52,939
and it's I mean I understand that I

33
00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:56,189
understand that completely I understand

34
00:01:56,189 --> 00:02:00,479
that completely ksi but there's a couple

35
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,149
things before you know something like

36
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:05,130
this happens before something like this

37
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:07,500
happens for example let's go back to

38
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,319
August 14th from ksi you made a couple

39
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,410
tweets saying someone from my if you've

40
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:14,190

41
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:17,580
- if you've reacted to slushie used my

42

content and got acclaim don't worry I

43
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,450
will be reversing the claim someone from

44
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,160
my team gave a go-ahead to claim bids

45
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,810
without talking to me about it got to

46
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:26,610
make sure the community can eat no

47
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:29,130
selfish shit I respected this actually a

48
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:30,870
lot I respected these toots oh they all

49
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,730

50
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:35,670

51
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:40,380
video I'm I mean he is 14th he made

52
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,990
these these tweets so me including

53
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:45,060
probably hundreds of people in the

54
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,770
reaction community you know start

55
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:50,130
reacting to his videos and you know now

56
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:53,430
now we're getting boom a block and boom

57
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:57,810
he's basically saying he has no it that

58
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:01,500
because that's just how label works then

59
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,230
you really shouldn't of tweeted this at

60
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:07,530
all unless you actually knew what was

61
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,090
happening or what was going on you

62
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:12,870
should not have tweeted this at all it's

63
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:17,430
uh it's I mean whatever that's fine I

64
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:20,959
mean but I just it's kind of annoying I

65
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,209
guess to you know tell everybody the

66
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:26,520
community you have the go-ahead to react

67
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,940
to your videos to your music videos and

68
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:31,860
you know basically you even reply to

69
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,620
kaavo's youtube if I wasn't cutting you

70
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,060
wouldn't have any reason to make videos

71
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,850
on me I'm giving you content be happy so

72
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:41,700
I mean he's basically saying he's given

73
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,830
people content but nope you're not

74
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:46,110
giving people content because it's

75
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,360
blocked in all countries on my video and

76
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,250
you basically just said a few days ago

77
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:54,660
that you know basically you can't just

78
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:57,959
now saying you can't react to any of the

79
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:00,930
his music and the EP after the fact that

80
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,610
all these videos including mine got

81
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:08,850
blocked that's I mean I don't want to be

82
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:11,130
a do should just say you know that's a

83
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:15,470
dick move but I mean it's understandable

84
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:20,220
but also it's kind of a dick move that

85
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,989
you would you know go ahead August 14th

86
00:04:21,989 --> 00:04:23,720
and just basically give the go-ahead to

87
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:27,420
everybody to allow you to use your user

88
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,950
content you allowed everybody to use

89
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,050

93
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:44,880

97
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,140
a little bit of upset here I'm a little

98
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:59,400
bit upset it's quite annoying and I have

99

105
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:16,110
is having the the okay the go-ahead from

106
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:18,960

schoolwork your information and actually

look into what could have happened what

115
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:41,370
could have affected creators in the

116
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:43,170
future by you telling creators that they

117
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:46,020
can go ahead and use it to randomly boom

118
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:50,430
