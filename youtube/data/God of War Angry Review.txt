00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:51,290
and play all of them immediately this is

56
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:54,080
my first god of war game and because I

57
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,360
was always playing on the Xbox before I

58
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,300
got my ps4 so I never really got to try

59
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,569
the older games so I went in fresh

60
00:04:02,569 --> 00:04:04,730
knowing next to nothing about these

61
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:06,950
games other than their like super bloody

62
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:16,320
and sometimes pretty raunchy

63
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:31,240
my lord

64
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,000
but for this outing it looks like Santa

65
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,069
Monica PlayStation went with a more

66
00:04:36,069 --> 00:04:52,840
serious approach

67
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:59,500
the twist

68
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,169
[Music]

69
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:06,349
did your dad thing do it yes then you're

70
00:05:06,349 --> 00:05:09,139
proud of him with all of the gods dead

71
00:05:09,139 --> 00:05:11,300
in his all by his own hands in his own

72
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,020
realm

73
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,870
Kratos finds himself hiding out in the

74
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:18,620
world of Norse mythology where he meets

75
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:26,880
another woman and has a son at Reyes

76
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:35,490
[Applause]

77
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:35,560
[Music]

78
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:42,279
[Applause]

79
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:45,469
cold-blooded killer as the game opens

80
00:05:45,469 --> 00:05:48,560
tragedy has already occurred his wife

81
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,830
has passed and together father and son

82
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:54,889
aim to honor the final wish of the boy's

83
00:05:54,889 --> 00:05:57,710
mother to spread her ashes from the

84
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:00,379
highest peak I was a bit worried about

85
00:06:00,379 --> 00:06:03,319
this whole Kratos son as a mechanic it

86
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:05,620
could have easily devolved into some

87
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:09,110
escort mission where he's a burden more

88
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:11,210
than you know someone who would you

89
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:13,759
would want around but I'm happy to

90
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,819
report the traces is he's integrated

91
00:06:16,819 --> 00:06:19,490
perfectly here like BioShock Infinite

92
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:22,039
perhaps even better than that game as

93
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:24,319
you can use the boy to help you in

94
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,349
combat as he wields his own weapon the

95
00:06:27,349 --> 00:06:29,300
bow and arrow and this gives you access

96
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,689
to to frost and shock arrows to stun

97
00:06:32,689 --> 00:06:35,839
enemies in combat that you control he'll

98
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:38,089
sometimes randomly jump on baddies

99
00:06:38,089 --> 00:06:40,639
giving you an opportunity to get in some

100
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,550
free shots and he's super helpful in

101
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,949
solving the puzzles throughout your

102
00:06:45,949 --> 00:06:49,370
journey plus it's rather hilarious how

103
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:52,849
Kratos sort of treats him he's rather

104
00:06:52,849 --> 00:06:56,449
cold and sort of standoffish only really

105
00:06:56,449 --> 00:07:00,319
referring to him as the boy you can keep

106
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:05,060
a boy counter going for how often Kratos

107
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:08,779
says it drink every time he says boy boy

108
00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:10,249
boy

109
00:07:10,249 --> 00:07:16,639
boy boy boy white boy white boy boy boy

110
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,959
boy boy boy boy boy boy tongue boy boy

111
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:26,269
boy boy boy boy boy boy boy on second

112
00:07:26,269 --> 00:07:28,069
thought don't you you you would likely

113
00:07:28,069 --> 00:07:29,899
die of alcohol poisoning

114
00:07:29,899 --> 00:07:32,329
I do not condone that he really only

115
00:07:32,329 --> 00:07:34,999
uses his name when he gets serious and

116
00:07:34,999 --> 00:07:37,309
that's just like my own dad

117
00:07:37,309 --> 00:07:40,849
this is dad a war indeed as the rolling

118
00:07:40,849 --> 00:07:43,389
joke goes you know just watching their

119
00:07:43,389 --> 00:07:46,129
relationship evolved through ups and

120
00:07:46,129 --> 00:07:48,439
downs throughout the game it's a major

121
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:55,419
draw and one of the game strengths there

122
00:07:55,419 --> 00:08:02,119
there it is boy look look at it the foot

123
00:08:02,119 --> 00:08:06,919
of the mountain you know just be on that

124
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:11,779
Ridge and up those steps your mother she

125
00:08:11,779 --> 00:08:13,380
only had one

126
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:17,640
wish that we would spread her ashes from

127
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:22,200
the highest of regions in all the realms

128
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:28,810
and now we're here

129
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:35,370
the honor should be yours I trust him

130
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:40,200
this is a momentous occasion one where

131
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,550
we will finally honor the memory of your

132
00:08:44,550 --> 00:09:08,370
mother another strength easily has to be

133
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:11,040
this world that they've chosen to put

134
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,440
Kratos in it's just an extremely

135
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,010
entertaining and very clever way to tell

136
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:19,880
a Norse mythology story with us

137
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:23,160
integrated to it in a unique and new way

138
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,279
it actually feels so natural though to

139
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:28,830
keep the God of War storyline going as a

140
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:31,290
sort of God of War for rather than some

141
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:34,200
kind of hard reboot Kratos has killed

142
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,020
all of his realms gods will he kill all

143
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:40,560
these famous gods I also loved how they

144
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,250
portray Odin Thor Freya me Mir the

145
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,350
dwarves who made Kratos his new axe

146
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:48,779
weapon in the game and Thor's hammer for

147
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:50,880
that matter they sort of flipped the

148
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,000
script and it kind of seems like those

149
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,490
Marvel gods that we all know and love

150
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:58,830
and are hot right now are kind of

151
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:01,790
massive fucking assholes liars cheats

152
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:04,529
kind of the bad guys and honestly it's a

153
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:07,650
breath of fresh air I fucking look the

168
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:23,560
another thing this game does above and

169
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,500
beyond other games is the graphics and

170
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,959
and just the architecture in the world

171
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:32,079
levels it's absolutely beautiful it's

172
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,680
breathtaking the sense of scale is so

173
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,760
well done

174
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,519
the amount of detail here just these

175
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,149
huge max of enemies and bosses and the

176
00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:45,520
architecture of the buildings and how

177
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,709
they everything moves effortlessly

178
00:11:47,709 --> 00:11:49,930
without loading or framerate drops new

179
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:51,790
accent things are moving it's

180
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:54,399
technically impressive and even more so

181
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,380
as the camera never really breaks away

182
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,779
cuts out or fades out during these

183
00:11:58,779 --> 00:12:02,170
sequences it all really helps to put you

184
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:04,839
into that level that's sort of immersion

185
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:07,990
that so few games have in the past it

186
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:10,930
and it's here already all of these

187
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:14,680
things equal a by okay from me

188
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,750
but what really sells this game and

189
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,610
makes it such an enjoyable experience

190
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:21,220
from start to finish is the hands-down

191
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:24,970
best combat system from the opening

192
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:51,440
tutorial it feels so damn good

193
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,320
look at that Joe that was sweet

194
00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:05,670
cinematic mist oh that's cool ah I tried

195
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:12,480
to take his leg out it's visceral it's

196
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,190
raw it is brutal but yet intuitive

197
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:19,410
wide-ranging excellently executed it is

198
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:22,410
pretty amazing considering how Kratos is

199
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:24,870
weapon selection here is really limited

200
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:27,060
I thought I was gonna get pretty fucking

201
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,760
bored with the combat here and I never

202
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,340
did I mean there is an upgrade system

203
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:35,070
with some light RPG elements of crafting

204
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:38,700
new armor sets and weapon modifications

205
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,220
for increased stats there's new skills

206
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,590
that you can unlock and slot in and

207
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:46,320
choose from for the right combinations

208
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,450
and situations you can even customize

209
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:51,600
the weapons and armor further with slot

210
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,850
able runes which give different unique

211
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:57,090
bonuses the variety of new looking armor

212
00:13:57,090 --> 00:14:01,050
sets can't really rival full RPGs but it

213
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:03,300
does just enough that it keeps you

214
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,280
excited about getting that next set of

215
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,070
armor or working hard on on side

216
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:10,380
missions and just kind of like grinding

217
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,720
a bit to get that next set of armor with

218
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,640
the unique materials that you need to

219
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,490
craft it you can even upgrade the boy if

220
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:21,150
you want if he's been a good boy if not

221
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:24,060
then he gets shit jar you upgrade the

222
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:27,540
boy they've been talking sass just his

223
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:32,220
bow and his jibber jabber just doesn't

224
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:32,810
deserve it

225
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:37,950
I'm the boy's father

226
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:41,440
the game is a sufficient challenge it

227
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,550
gets downright tough at times okay just

228
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:48,700
really pissing me off now forgive I'm

229
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,610
pissed off with this god dammit

230
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:54,820
Joe don't talk to me nobody can talk to

231
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:55,540
me right now

232
00:14:55,540 --> 00:15:01,820
I had it leave me alone

233
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:05,210
oh I'm gonna fucking die I went out for

234
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:08,450
your subscription takes I eat out help

235
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:21,170
me

236
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:29,540
I didn't do anything

237
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:33,230
I was quiet like you asked daddy's got a

238
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:38,780
chair

239
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:51,640
hey you saw that glitch

240
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:58,160
oh that's not fucking fair

241
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,670
I can't give you the controller Joe I

242
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:05,500
can't I can't give you the controller I

243
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,740
can't

244
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:26,330
I'm in locked locked in Joe now that was

245
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:32,630
within a few hits especially off the

246
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:35,060
beaten path when you go exploring for

247
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,650
things but I loved it

248
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:40,220
okay as frustrated as I would get I

249
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,820
loved every second of it

250
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:46,340
O'Shea moans come around on day one all

251

256
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:01,490

257

that's it I'm mad Oh

258
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:20,360
I caught a big one

259
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,579
I caught a big one right there at the

260
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:28,100
end one two no we're only going for twos

261
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:36,380
we're going for two one no yeah one two

262
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:39,640

one two three here comes a big one

264
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:47,080
it's the three you don't go for the

265
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:51,130
three you go for two you go for two we

266
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:53,620
got it we got past the yellow here's one

267
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:56,860
and he goes for two which means the

268
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:59,080
yellow should be coming here's the

269
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:19,679
yellow we managed to get whoa oh my god

270
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,320
this game it gives you reasons though to

271
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,900
explore and solve side puzzles

272
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,210
there's unique storylines and dialogue

273
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:30,250
that if you rush through the campaign

274
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:33,100
you will completely miss and and

275
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,290
thankfully though you can at the end of

276
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:37,330
your adventure come back and and finish

277
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:39,669
the rest of this stuff in the world and

278
00:18:39,669 --> 00:18:41,890
while the game isn't an open-world game

279
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:44,020
it does a great job of sort of giving

280
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:46,450
you that feeling that it is on those

281
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:49,419
maps you can't really go a lot of places

282
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:51,610
and admittedly it is kind of mostly

283
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:53,830
linear but that's not necessarily a bad

284
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:56,260
thing and this game definitely proves

285
00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:02,160
that there's about one man and it's game

286
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,309
how pissed would you be that's this way

287
00:19:06,309 --> 00:19:08,389
the

288
00:19:08,389 --> 00:19:12,529
I would bring these guys take the

289
00:19:12,529 --> 00:19:15,109
controller and slam it into the dela

290
00:19:15,109 --> 00:19:19,999
your rage now with all this insane

291
00:19:19,999 --> 00:19:23,719
praise that I just pushed on this game

292
00:19:23,719 --> 00:19:26,330
surely that means that I agree with most

293
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:28,159
of the other reviewers who reviewed this

294
00:19:28,159 --> 00:19:31,159
game weeks ago early there's 10 9 of 10

295
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:33,229
and a billion 10 out of tens right

296
00:19:33,229 --> 00:19:35,570
perfect without issues in it and it

297
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:38,299
earns my highest marks might legendary

298
00:19:38,299 --> 00:19:39,320
rating right

299
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:43,519
well not exactly okay there there is no

300
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:46,759
doubt during my time playing that we

301
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:49,339
were all smiles and we enjoyed every bit

302
00:19:49,339 --> 00:19:52,129
of it we're always in that range of 8 9

303
00:19:52,129 --> 00:19:55,549
10 but a lot of smaller things did add

304
00:19:55,549 --> 00:19:57,919
up by the end of the game to bring it

305
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,889
down just a bit and it's so it's not

306
00:20:00,889 --> 00:20:02,779
without flaws of its own for example

307
00:20:02,779 --> 00:20:05,839
I'll tell you it does suffer a bit too

308
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:08,389
much from the your princess is in

309
00:20:08,389 --> 00:20:11,869
another castle syndrome like just a bit

310
00:20:11,869 --> 00:20:13,580
too many times you know where you're

311
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:16,119
about to achieve a reach your objective

312
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:19,219
or the ending and you and you just know

313
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:22,009
that something is gonna slam in your way

314
00:20:22,009 --> 00:20:24,799
or break or whatever arbitrarily

315
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:27,799
stopping you oh no there's a black fog

316
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:31,639
in your path and no reason just that

317
00:20:31,639 --> 00:20:33,979
kind of shit it happens a lot in this

318
00:20:33,979 --> 00:20:36,649
game and and well the first four or five

319
00:20:36,649 --> 00:20:38,119
times you accept it because you're

320
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:40,339
having such a good time but as it wears

321
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:42,409
on it gets a bit annoying at the lack of

322
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:45,289
creativity a tiny bit in the writing

323
00:20:45,289 --> 00:20:47,509
just to throw more obstacles in your way

324
00:20:47,509 --> 00:20:57,060
right all right

325
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:59,920
get see everyone so I do a little

326
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,460
annoying little annoying me

327
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:06,010
you wanna stay to fight three little

328
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:08,560
punch bet mini-bosses in a row that's

329
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:17,890
what you're doing here good boss

330
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:23,080
gauntlet why God of War why how many

331
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:26,350
times do I gotta put it my reviews the

332
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:30,190
boss gauntlets are stupid you don't need

333
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:32,410
this you really don't your story is very

334
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:37,380
great everything has been fucking sweet

335
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:46,180
I'd give any game shit door number three

336
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:49,570
II see the game knows what it's doing

337
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:51,550
the game knows that it's being

338
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:53,650
repetitive right now cuz it subverts

339
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:56,320
your expectations you just aim it and it

340
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,480
just blow so it knows that it was doing

341
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,100
also must admit that while the journey

342
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:06,760
is is fun the goal the objective that I

343
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,160
just had no emotional attachment to it

344
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,830
whatsoever honestly it didn't care to

345
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,840
bring the mother's ashes to the top of

346
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,420
the mountain because I never met her you

347
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:19,000
you'd never really see her you never you

348
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,430
know have that familiarity with her you

349
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:23,470
oh you remember you know they do but you

350
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:25,540
don't and you don't feel connected to

351
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:28,000
the whole point of the game well

352
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,180
thankfully the journey and that's where

353
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:33,040
the real entertainment is the journey

354
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:36,370
the boss battles along the way the the

355
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:39,760
opening level oh my god this is perhaps

356
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,510
one of the best opening levels in gaming

357
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:44,860
culminating and one of the best most

358
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:47,260
visceral boss battles that would

359
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:49,600
literally be like the final epic battle

360
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:57,080
in other games Oh

361
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:00,210
dude I was satisfied with the combat

362
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:15,840
already you don't even need to go we

363
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,820
have to use something else it's

364
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:26,820
obviously not working good you know here

365
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,210
in this game it's boss battle number one

366
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:32,159
okay this guy is worth the price of

367
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:51,059
admission alone unfortunately after such

368
00:23:51,059 --> 00:23:54,600
an exhilarating time and great opening

369
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,639
you could argue a bit that the follow-up

370
00:23:56,639 --> 00:23:59,730
levels are is a drag a little bit after

371
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,710
that right every time you've seen

372
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:03,480
they'll go underground the game drags

373
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,880
just a bit and it's mimicking kind of

374
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,340
Tomb Raider a little bit too much but

375
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,049
just as you're starting to get annoyed

376
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:12,929
and you're like ah of the fifth kick

377
00:24:12,929 --> 00:24:14,789
cave troll it shows up the game gives

378
00:24:14,789 --> 00:24:16,500
you a break and you get back above land

379
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,990
and out in the open and this is where it

380
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:21,870
really shines where all the amazing boss

381
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:24,539
battles happen and all the cool shit is

382
00:24:24,539 --> 00:24:26,730
above ground this game is a 10 out of 10

383
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:29,490
below browning gonna have some pacing

384
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:32,100
issues but you know and there's also a

385
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,320
bit of backtracking I should mention it

386
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,880
but it didn't bother me at all it's not

387
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,980
gonna bother you because it's not enough

388
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,929
to take away from the main experience

389
00:24:39,929 --> 00:24:42,269
however you will notice it more if

390
00:24:42,269 --> 00:24:45,000
you're doing all the side quests at the

391
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,830
same time during the story instead of

392
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:50,309
after and this game gives you plenty to

393
00:24:50,309 --> 00:24:52,830
do outside of that main storyline in

394
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:55,380
it's packed with value it's just a shame

395
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,779
that a lot of the nice lore pieces that

396
00:24:57,779 --> 00:25:00,240
you'll pick up it's done it's a small

397
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,690
fucking text in the boys journal I can't

398
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:04,380
reach it

399
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:08,100
right larger boy

400
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,770
that saying the world serpent spend all

401
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:14,549
the water of Midgard maybe the only one

402
00:25:14,549 --> 00:25:17,039
big enough to beat Thor I still can't

403
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:24,480
believe we met him dear Journal today

404
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,950
was it great also I was a bit annoyed

405
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:31,890
that they teased you these nine worlds

406
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:33,929
to you and then these other more famous

407
00:25:33,929 --> 00:25:36,600
gods from the Norse mythology but you

408
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,179
never really get to go there or see them

409
00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:41,580
they're sort of locked off and at first

410
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:45,120
I was like oh hell no I don't want it

411
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,270
one of nine worlds of shit over and over

412
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:50,700
because OJ and I have been traumatized

413
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:54,059
by Thor god of thunder on xbox all right

414
00:25:54,059 --> 00:26:12,270
oh oh oh I can't do it I can't do at

415
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,820
first I thought the corporate commanders

416
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:17,549
ultimate creation of evil had suddenly

417
00:26:17,549 --> 00:26:20,250
come to life and it would transform this

418
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:22,110
game from one of the best games of all

419
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:24,840
time into that shit forcing us into

420
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,360
these worlds of crappy enemies over and

421
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,169
over and thankfully it doesn't do that

422
00:26:30,169 --> 00:26:33,870
this is the game that Thor god of

423
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:36,809
thunder wishes it could be it's funny

424
00:26:36,809 --> 00:26:39,179
how similar they are it's just like if

425
00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:41,190
that games sold it's sold to the devil

426
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:43,080
to be a legendary game it's that good

427
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,190
gonna be the best you'll see

428
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:56,870
[Laughter]

429
00:26:56,870 --> 00:27:00,700
[Music]

430
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:03,409
and the difference is like night and day

431
00:27:03,409 --> 00:27:05,750
of what not to do versus how to do it

432
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:08,830
right however since it's done so well

433
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:13,610
after you finish you're like wait now I

434
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:16,220
want to go to those other realms on the

435
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:19,340
map and I want more and it kind of makes

436
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:22,220
me worry about DLC but as far as I know

437
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:25,610
there's no DLC season pass here so I

438
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:27,649
don't know I assume that those are

439
00:27:27,649 --> 00:27:29,450
locked off for good maybe in a sequel

440
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:32,899
however I love the implication that the

441
00:27:32,899 --> 00:27:34,970
stories of the gods that we know

442
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:36,590
throughout history and different

443
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:39,380
cultures are real and that they are just

444
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:41,929
different realms and it's possible that

445
00:27:41,929 --> 00:27:44,510
Kratos can go and journey to them all

446
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:48,230
and kill them all kill all of the gods

447
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:50,409
that's the sort of ridiculous

448
00:27:50,409 --> 00:27:53,149
implication that so much fun and the

449
00:27:53,149 --> 00:27:56,360
impact of killing of God and fucking up

450
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,909
the lore in these places it's so

451
00:27:58,909 --> 00:27:59,720
intriguing

452
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,820
it's the x-factor for me in this

453
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:05,510
franchise and I just cannot wait to see

454
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:09,019
more so the final verdict for God of War

455
00:28:09,019 --> 00:28:12,470
so close to a 10 it is the highest 9 out

456
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:14,659
of 10 that I can give with a totally

457
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:17,059
easy badass seal of approval

458
00:28:17,059 --> 00:28:19,639
it definitely has 10 out of 10 potential

459
00:28:19,639 --> 00:28:21,649
it hits that level often during the

460
00:28:21,649 --> 00:28:23,389
journey but there are certain sections

461
00:28:23,389 --> 00:28:25,820
that drag a bit it's got some locked-off

462
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:28,279
content feeling to it even though

463
00:28:28,279 --> 00:28:31,220
there's more than enough here ok but the

464
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:33,889
story kind of ends a bit short and your

465
00:28:33,889 --> 00:28:36,679
hope to you want to see more it's not

466
00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:39,200
short it's just of the epic stuff right

467
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,049
what it does to set up future games and

468
00:28:42,049 --> 00:28:44,059
if it's done at this level from the

469
00:28:44,059 --> 00:28:45,710
potential we see in the clips and the

470
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:48,769
visions of what's to come that's certain

471
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:50,450
to earn this franchise a legendary

472
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:53,690
rating from me and I cannot wait to see

473
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,910
the sequel guys if you

474
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:57,860
how to pick this one up yet do it now

475
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:02,540
and my xbox guys okay seriously this

476
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,160
thing is closed to a system cell and

477
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,830
with so many good exclusives out on that

478
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,960
system now I really would consider

479
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,970
picking up the ps4 at this point if you

480
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:13,190
even if you hate that idea you're like

481
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:15,830
some kind of fanboy that's just how much

482
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:18,320
the times are changing here it's hard to

483
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,470
really admit otherwise I played this on

484
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:25,040
a regular ps4 not a pro system and I'm

485
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,050
sure there's some used ps4 is out there

486
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:28,790
pretty cheap ok if you don't want Sanya

487
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:31,070
to see your money consider it because

488
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:33,110
it's worth it guys from one game or to

489
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:36,170
another trust me it's kick-ass alright

490
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:38,720
consider picking it up until then I'll

491
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,800
see you guys on the next hangry Josh oh

492
00:29:41,800 --> 00:30:03,970
boy good boy

493
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:06,920
