1
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:04,330
God

2
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:23,650
yeah

3
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:31,509
can you believe how fast as clouds are moving storms a brewin also i don't have

4
00:00:31,509 --> 00:00:35,290
any shoes on right now even though i'm running like 10 miles because i'm using

5
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:40,840
my my shoes to hold the camera there windy phone kept blown over

6
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,600
alright alright alright i might be smiling on the outside

7
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:01,940
I'm crying on the inside it is 301 in the p.i spent the entire day wrestling

8
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:07,040
to get this camera to work but look good though this is a 4k vlog today for a

9
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:12,020
very special reason for k because yesterday's episode about the new DJ I

10
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:18,020
Matic Pro drone was very popular but a lot of people had a lot of questions

11
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:22,250
about the imagery that this thing yields versus the imagery that this thing yield

12
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:28,369
so long story long I thought I'd shoot today in 4k that way i can put the 4k

13
00:01:28,369 --> 00:01:33,619
image from these suckers in there like in its raw pure State

14
00:01:33,619 --> 00:01:39,080
I just been looking at camera setup camera that's a canon 5d mark for and

15
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:43,729
then I got this monitor down here to see all this monitors their microphones

16
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:48,560
there however to get this thing to work if you're not John Olson just ignore

17
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:54,679
this next part John how do you possibly shoot your daily videos in 4k everyday

18
00:01:54,679 --> 00:01:59,660
how is this not just a huge pain in the act of the number one piece of criticism

19
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:05,630
i was getting yesterday automatic pro that's the tiny girl lets that's this

20
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:08,630
guy was that the image seem soft

21
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:18,590
oh yeah the image may have been soft because i had to adjust the resolution

22
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:23,810
of it to match yesterday's episode which is why today's important by the way if

23
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:30,260
you click the little car right there and they all way up here to 4k you can see

24
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,090
this video and all its glory

25
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:34,850
you're going to want to have a really good internet connection if you do that

26
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:39,740
otherwise it's gonna like glitch and buffer and all that bullshit now before

27
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:44,300
i take these drugs out for a side-by-side comparison i want to sort

28
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:51,950
of get into my my entire thesis and understanding behind drone quality first

29
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:54,600
since this is the underlying theme of why I'm going

30
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,600
there in the first place

31
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:18,439
okay I hear y-axis here the marker the tip just falls out of this marker and

32
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:26,840
then look at my fingers your x-axis here this is convenience practicality of use

33
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:36,739
penny asked super-convenient x-axis here is the quality of the image this is the

34
00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:43,129
best quality you could ever ask for their boat a toe now ideally what you're

35
00:03:43,129 --> 00:03:47,840
looking for in any piece of hardware is fertile in this sweet spot here that

36
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,919
means both super convenient and very high quality for you longtime viewers of

37
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:56,750
the blog remember to supply this right this is a parent drone it's closer to a

38
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:00,650
toy than a drone pretty low quality image but really easy to keeping your

39
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:09,349
backpack so this little drone is super convenient but very very low-quality DJI

40
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:13,459
inspire maybe you've seen this thing before this monstrous drone that like

41
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:18,829
has moving arms like a space alien my friend jesse has one so the quality is

42
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:24,020
over here but it's not to be at all in fact it's acute pain you know that

43
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,389
exists here which brings us to this thing

44
00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:31,130
the phantom 4 up until yesterday my favorite drug on the market convenient

45
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:34,250
and very high quality right about here

46
00:04:34,789 --> 00:04:39,740
the quality is almost the pretty convenient and then comes the Matic Pro

47
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:45,560
is not a qualitatively as the p4 i would say it's right here but it's convenient

48
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,729
is up here the ideal piece of equipment lives here

49
00:04:49,729 --> 00:04:54,320
the reason why i love this thing is because it lives right here good enough

50
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,090
quality and very convenient any day of the week i'll trade a tiny bit of

51
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:02,090
quality to get the shot

52
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:15,790
leaving for traffic on my skateboard looks like in for the better

53
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,700
okay I'm down here under the Williamsburg Bridge to do a

54
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:28,210
comprehensive analysis between the phantom 4 and the DJI Matic Pro I also

55
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:32,170
brought the parent whatever plastic thrown just as a control study number

56
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:38,200
one backpack sighs this is the DJI gained from for backpack as you can see

57
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:42,760
it's a fairly large pack this big bag is necessary to carry the drone down here

58
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,090
you got your controller propellers etc

59
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:50,920
next up is the Matic Pro the Maverick fits in this lovely satchel i wish this

60
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,910
satchel came in cheetah print or maybe a hot pink in this little satchel fit the

61
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:59,050
controller and then the drone itself last compares the parrot drone not an

62
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:04,570
official bag but the drone itself and then the propellers which I keep in this

63
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:09,010
carrying case this thing is a pretty serious commitment this thing is

64
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:12,790
worthless on the Waimea part of this video you could take this out of date

65
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:16,840
you can take this to the roller skating rink you could take this to the dairy

66
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,430
products for the travel with

67
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:28,210
ok now the moment of truth i'm going to apply each of the three drones on the

68
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:31,570
same route for a side-by-side comparison

69
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:37,570
ok first not preventing for I really really wish I picked today that wasn't

70
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:42,700
like a stormy like horrible kill force winds but already started this

71
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,700
okay here we go

72
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:53,990
another grow

73
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,490
yeah

74
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:03,360
this is the parent i'll just tell you right now i'm going to want a hundred

75
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,020
percent lose this the window tickets gonna fly away

76
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:12,580
yeah

77
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:17,260
get them off

78
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:23,530
god this thing is a nightmare

79
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:28,570
it's like 10 feet of water lost connection which is what always happens

80
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:32,530
and then it's just SAT there and then it flew back here and then it wouldn't land

81
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:40,770
looking at the Phantom footage right next to the mattock footage

82
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:46,140
the magic is a much softer make like less sharp unless it's a much softer

83
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:53,310
image than the Phantom for the phantom 4 is a superior camera the gap is big but

84
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:58,290
not overwhelming but it is a superior camera but when you're talking about the

85
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:06,330
idea of either carrying this to capture that perfect image or carrying just this

86
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:11,880
get an image that's good but not great for someone like me who a youtuber I

87
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:16,380
make the video everyday convenience is a super huge priority so I'm going to

88
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:19,590
stick with this but all of you commenters were totally right

89
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:26,280
the natick does have a softer less sharp image then the big but if we're gonna

90
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:33,390
forgive her back to wear today began i still think convenience over here is

91
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:38,850
just as important as quality over here so i will trade this little bit of

92
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:41,880
quality for this huge amount of convenience

93
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:48,030
oh and the bebop drone this thing I just put that in there to show you what a

94
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:52,050
drone of comparable size the natick actually looks like

95
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:56,400
and the last thing to say is i wish i had a GoPro karma are so frustrating

96
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,400
that i don't i would love to show you what that looks like

97
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:05,470
because i don't have a GoPro karma yet they just lonely one for one day to give

98
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:10,900
it back they do have this this is the session 5 in 4k the new session that's

99
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,040
not out yet

100
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:15,610
I kind of took it from him and didn't give it back but this is the exact

101
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:19,780
camera that will be on the Karma to give you ideas like what the karma is going

102
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:23,500
to look like that's a pretty good image here all pretend I'm a drone

103
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:37,150
that's the best i could do that was shot on this little day for Kerry pretty

104
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:46,960
pretty good pretty good GoPro okay i hope this was helpful just thinking I

105
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:51,760
had three drones in my back and then i have this camera which is a 5d mark for

106
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,440
its expensive there would be a terrible terrible day to get robbed

107
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:02,740
unless you're the robber to be a great day to Rodney how's that doesn't happen
