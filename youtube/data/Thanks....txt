9
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,859

30
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,260
you basically get rolls you get tickets

31
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,140
and you can win stuff off Amazon and I

32
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,270
find this app very fun I do it on my

33
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:18,090
spare time along with other apps of

34
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:19,350
course but this again this is not

35
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:20,939
sponsored this is just kind of a little

36
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:24,840
hobby I'm doing right now and you know

37
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,820
you could win free stuff for example I'm

38
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,890
saving up to get an impact driver drill

39
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,990
you guys might not be pretty interested

40
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:31,740
with that but you can get like

41
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,000
PlayStation 4 controllers but you know

42
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,530
you're gonna see that in this video but

43
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:36,270
you know again Fred code right here very

44
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:37,409
dice everything will be down in the

45
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:38,790
description check it out but you know

46
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,920
what let's go into it let's go alright

47
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,100
guys so we are here right now was this

48
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,630
is this is basically what this game is

49
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,770
you can see I have 910 rolls left and

50
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:52,619
I'm I'm literally just you know rolling

51
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:55,229
and I'm doing a x 5 dice which is times

52
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:56,909
5 the amount of what the dice is like

53
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:59,490
see right there doubles 120 tickets it's

54
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:01,560
uh you know actually really not that bad

55
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,869
you in tickets 55 tickets you know this

56
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:07,079
is basically what this game is is you

57
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:09,599
get tickets you get I mean you get rolls

58
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,560
you get rolls for every roll you get

59
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,300
and the number you roll you get tickets

60
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,099
and with tickets you can win and earn

61
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:17,700
stuff

62
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,020
which is honestly pretty cool my goal is

63
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:23,459
60,000 tickets

64
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:26,520
I'm already I don't I don't know how

65
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,930
much I'm gonna get but how we have 845

66
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:34,530
rolls left I definitely would like to be

67
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:37,440
over 30,000 tickets which it's looking

68
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,640
pretty good so far but we have 830 rolls

69
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,730
and it's using five rolls per roll just

70
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,790
because I have the times five counter on

71
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:49,650
so you know pretty much it works pretty

72
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,959
good when you get doubles let's see if

73
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:54,120
we can get doubles here pretty soon if

74
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,190
you get doubles you basically double the

75
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,780
amount of rolls when you do the times

76
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:02,120
five let's see no doubles the guy the 45

77
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,680
there we go doubles 12 and 12 that's

78
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,150
best when we got a hundred and twenty

79
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,150
tickets for five rolls which is

80
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,650
absolutely outstanding and their doubles

81
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:14,670
again 80 tickets so I do times five hope

82
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:17,099
for doubles I find it a lot easier I

83
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:18,120
think it's a good way to get tickets

84
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,980
also you guys might be seeing a little

85
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,380
time around the side you get daily spins

86
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,120
which gives you an amount of rolls you

87
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,010
can do for that day and you also have a

88
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:30,450
timer your daily doubles daily doubles

89
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:35,670
that is basically every 24 hours you

90
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:37,620
roll and you get every single double on

91
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,680
the dice like one on one 2 &amp; 2 3 &amp; 3 you

92
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,540
get 300 tickets if you manage to get all

93
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,829
of them for that whole day then it

94
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:46,230
resets every 24 hours which I've already

95
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:51,600
done that but we are at 695 rolls that

96
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,470
is not bad that is not bad at all now we

97
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:59,459
got 60 doubles again three that see that

98
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:00,660
that's not a very good one you don't

99
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,250
want to get anything less than a five

100
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,340
when you do the times five counter it

101
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:08,069
does not do a very good it's not not

102
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:09,900
very good roles especially doing it

103
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,660
times 5 C 6 is all right you can just

104
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,040
tap it to you don't have to hold it down

105
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:19,919
220 tickets we're at 28 6 with 640 rolls

106
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:25,590
we should definitely have 30,000 here

107
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:27,389
pretty soon we should we should have

108
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:30,930
more than 30,000 once we're done with

109
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:34,229
these these rolls come on baby

110
00:04:34,229 --> 00:04:36,449
you could like literally when so much

111
00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:39,629
 with this app you know my my fiance

112
00:04:39,629 --> 00:04:41,490
showed me this app because she does it

113
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,740
on her spare time when she's bored but

114
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,090
she actually kind of does this a little

115
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:47,639
bit more professionally she's in you

116

127
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,400

128

bucks and just win something so you were

130
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,800

131
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,529
hundred bucks and get twice the amount

132
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:24,509

146
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:58,589
give you examples what you can get I'm

147
00:05:58,589 --> 00:06:00,240
in the ticket section this is what I'm

148
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,589
saving up for I could get a Black &amp;

149
00:06:01,589 --> 00:06:04,020
Decker impact driver right now for

150
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,879
thirty thousand tickets I'm saving up to

151
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:07,229
get the makita

152
00:06:07,229 --> 00:06:09,150
because the makita is a lot better brand

153
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:10,710
it comes with two batteries or that the

154
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:12,900
wall but you know this is my hobby stuff

155
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,990
that I do for my personal hobby and

156
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:16,919
that's why I'm kind of earning up

157
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:18,150
because a lot of these things are a

158
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:21,569
hundred bucks you know online to buy and

159
00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:23,279
you know I'm actually playing a game but

160
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:24,870
you know you get other things like 8k

161
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:28,139
10k tickets you know 20k tickets or you

162
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:30,629
can just search whatever the heck you

163
