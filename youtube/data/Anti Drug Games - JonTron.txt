Jacques what is this where'd you learn

to do this have you been doing seed back

00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:01,750
off old timer this is cool stuff shot

11

come on man you're smarter than this

12
00:01:03,219 --> 00:01:05,470
winners don't do drugs remember just

13
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:07,270
like all the arcades in the 80s told us

14
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:10,720
when I'm high I feel like a winner we

15
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,759
gotta get you straight Jack scared

16
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:15,100
straight you see this tall imma treat

17
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,750
you like a bitch you gonna call my

18
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:17,860
Chester

19
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,899
whenever I tell you okay maybe not that

20
00:01:19,899 --> 00:01:24,039
straight the date is October 14th 1982

21
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:26,140
drugs are rampant in the streets of the

22
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:28,539
United States President Ronald Reagan

23
00:01:28,539 --> 00:01:29,920
declares them a threat to national

24
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,560
security the following decades will be

25
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,780
shaped by these actions forever as the

26
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:37,090
war on drugs continues to this very day

27
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:38,909
the message was clear

28
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:45,850
remember winners don't do drugs

29
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:47,620
remember when you'd play an arcade game

30
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,810
back in the 80s or 90s it would show you

31
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,460
that screen before you played the game

32
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,560
not to mention the numerous dare

33
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,300
campaigns that would tour school to

34
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,490
school I mean truth be told we didn't

35
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:58,869
even give it much thought as kids I mean

36
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:00,040
it was just so been ingrained in our

37
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,810
collective unconscious I mean drugs were

38
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:03,970
such a problem in the 70s and 80s by the

39
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:05,290
time we were growing up this was just

40
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:08,289
accepted and expected anyone living back

41
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:09,789
then will be able to recall for you the

42
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:12,130
wealth of PSAs on the topic that ranged

43
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:14,830
from realistic to ludicrous who taught

44
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:20,130
you how to do this stuff by watching you

45
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:23,110
that that never gets old but that's not

46
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,880
even scratching the surface have a look

47
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,360
at this what's wrong with you

48
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,790
tonsillitis appendicitis yeah you know

49
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:35,230
what I think you got a point there it

50
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:37,090
would be bad if my surgeon was smoking

51
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,950
pot while operating on me here's a list

52
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,209
of other things I wouldn't want him

53
00:02:40,209 --> 00:02:42,310
doing anything else but my fucking

54
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:45,400
surgery let's see if I can still make a

55
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,060
straight line you're really a piece of

56
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,350
shit aren't you and then of course

57
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:51,959
there's the one that lives in infamy

58
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:54,030
this is your brain on drugs

59
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:56,310
[Applause]

60
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:59,590
any questions yeah I think I got a few

61
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,030
so you're telling me that my brain on

62
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,220
drugs is a healthy nutritious breakfast

63
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:06,010
that helps my brain grow should I

64
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:07,900
actually do some drugs how could the

65
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,000
point not have been driven home even our

66
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,739
celebrity idols were telling us that

67
00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:14,260
drugs were the spawn of Satan it even

68
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,209
got to the point when hanna-barbera and

69
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:18,400
pee-wee Herman were telling us to stay

70
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,900
away this is crack you know I'm just not

71
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,430
sure how to deal with the emotions that

72
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,560
come up after pee-wee Herman tells me

73
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,640

76
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,490
state of national emergency

77
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:40,530

fine we'll take this to the only place

100
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,979
you understand to the world of video

101
00:04:35,979 --> 00:04:38,590
gaming in the 80s arcades were the cool

102
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:41,080
hangouts for kids they had Galaga Donkey

103
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,210
Kong and of course hard drug dealers now

104
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:44,470
what can I say it was a sign of the

105
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:44,919
times

106
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:46,660
pac-man popping pills Mario's eaten

107
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,520
mushrooms in Simon Belmont terrible

108
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,110
off-screen addiction to heroin and look

109
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:51,910
at him in part four could barely hold

110
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:53,830
his whip is sad really that made our

111
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,599
caves a prime target for the anti-drug

112
00:04:55,599 --> 00:04:57,669
campaign which led to the creation of

113
00:04:57,669 --> 00:04:59,710
games like narc in this game you're

114
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,599
assuming the role of a narcotics officer

115
00:05:01,599 --> 00:05:05,110
named max force oh if you get a second

116
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,509
player in there they can play as hitman

117
00:05:07,509 --> 00:05:11,770
who have mercy I guess nobody told me

118
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,960
cops started doing wrestler names I mean

119
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,430
not that I'm even a percent I just would

120
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,319
have liked to know oh this is great now

121
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:19,449
we can finally teach kids good moral

122
00:05:19,449 --> 00:05:20,700

Reagan's hi

126
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,400
well alright maybe those guys were just

127
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,320
resisting arrest you know I mean they

128
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,300
had to be dealt with after all we're

129
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,590
just going in there with enough

130
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:43,730
firepower to protect ourselves

131
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:48,320
not even that

132
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,120
what's amazing but to be honest I guess

133
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,530
they were just trying to portray with

134
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:54,390
utmost realism how we handle drug

135
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:58,520
offenders in this country

136
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,520
cocaine is really popular with them the

137
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:10,200
same guy too little too late talking leg

138
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,480
I'll be able to put an end to this drug

139
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,280
ring once I figure out how to drive a

140
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,620
stick house yep listen how's a clutch

141
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,540
work again finally you get to the game's

142
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,610
antagonist mr. big who's apparently a

143
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:23,370
real good Tokyo drifter over here he's

144
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:25,770
got a picture of himself labeled mean

145
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:27,660
now there's so many things wrong with

146
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:32,870

getting work after Mambo number 5 I've

152
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,690
never seen a game go from a perfect zero

153
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:00,760
to a perfect 10 this quickly is this

to the sober individual we're gonna have

158
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,710
to take the most extreme measure

159
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:10,600
possible playing Wally bear in the know

160
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,340
game under no circumstances would I do

161
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,380
this otherwise because it's basically it

162
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:17,380
came to torture this is madness why is

163
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,540
there no player and helmet on his estate

164
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,720

00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,990
see the cartridge is kind of weird

168
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,490
because it's not officially licensed by

169
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:32,710
Nintendo also on part of the label

170
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:35,170
there's a circle that says press ear and

171
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:36,370
when you push it it plays a jeff

172
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:40,510
vanvonderen sound bite I'm just playing

173
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,890
with you it doesn't do jack shit why is

174
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:43,570
it here who was even out there

175
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:45,700
manufacturing their own NES cartridges

176
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,650
anyway well what is it

177
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:49,750
Chinese glue mothballs how many kids

178
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,850
written this before huh probably the

179
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:54,570
disease now this game was made in 1992

180
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:56,200
exclusively for a North American

181
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,750
audience by American video entertainment

182
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,820
they're also known for such other

183
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:03,190
classics as blackjack puzzle and of

184
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,630
course how can we forget due to the

185
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:10,270
attitude so in short that's how you know

186
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:13,180
it's gonna be good Wally bear and the no

187
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,190
gang now I can already see him saying no

188
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:17,740
to society's norms now as you can see he

189
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,020
does not wear his hat straight no it's

190
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,490
perfect because if a drug dealer walks

191
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:23,320
up to that side of his body he doesn't

192
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,000
have to say no to him his clothes do it

193
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,460
for him what was the color palette on

194
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,680
this one public restroom greens and

195
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,270
browns Jesus Christ

196
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:34,760
uncle Gary grizzly has been planning a

197
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,880
party for you in the know game

[Music]

199
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,539
hey dad I know you like to live your

200
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:43,829
life on the free and easy but you think

201
00:08:43,829 --> 00:08:45,120
you could do I'll do away with the whole

202
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,070
no pants ting till after I leave get a

203
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,990
pair of tearaway pants and goddamn

204
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:51,329
anything for God's sake yeah Wally I

205
00:08:51,329 --> 00:08:52,649
know how you feel

206
00:08:52,649 --> 00:08:56,959
my dad doesn't wear pants either dad

207
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,519
invite all your friends and try to reach

208
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:00,959
his house before dark

209
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,180
take care Wally and remember to say no

210
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:06,660
stay smart don't start don't start what

211
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,540
fires okay now that's a different bear

212
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:13,019
kids Wally bear may have five lives but

213
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:16,199
you only have one so the game starts out

214
00:09:16,199 --> 00:09:18,060
in this suburban town you play as this

215
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,510
bear named Wally who rides a skateboard

216
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:23,399
everywhere also even though you play as

217
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:25,410
an anthropomorphic bear dogs are still

218
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:27,810
dogs and birds are still birds and I

219
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,370
mean I can't blame him for being mad I'd

220
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,290
be pissed too if no one transformed me

221
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:33,060
into a radical sunglass wearing

222
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:36,420
skateboarding version of myself Oh God

223
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,550
seriously that's it one hit and you're

224
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:39,170
dead

225
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:41,730
if you die you have to go all the way

226
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:43,649
back and each level is ridiculously

227
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:45,420
repetitive and difficult I think it's

228
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,160
worth noting that GamePro gave this game

229
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,440
a 5 out of 5 on the fun factor and the

230
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,660
challenge sister sinister you're full of

231
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,370
shit also looks like they had a

232
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:54,839
nightshade competition in this issue

233
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:58,560
like no one tell me I'm gonna take that

234
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,230
sitting down the one saving grace is

235
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:02,610
picking up what I assumed to be a

236
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,890
frisbee or uh perhaps it's a one-way

237
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:06,839
boomerang pie I don't know something

238
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:08,160
like that when you get it you can

239
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,870
actually shoot the enemies and finally

240
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:11,880
kill them even though it's still really

241
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,410
hard cuz these birds are endless and

242
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:14,940
you're just on a skateboard the whole

243
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,370
time imagine and oh really imagine us if

244
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:19,589
every level in a video game was the ice

245
00:10:19,589 --> 00:10:23,220
level pets this game and it's got

246
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:27,240
platforming oh my my run and you can

247
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,010
actually take one extra hit when you put

248
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:30,660
the frisbee you can even just breeze

249
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,040
through some of these levels if you just

250
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,050
keep shooting in a straight line but if

251
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,640
you take any damage the frisbee goes

252
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,170
away and you can't throw it anymore see

253
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,880
you might as well reset because this

254
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,220
game is nearly impossible without it

255
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,980
also I think somehow you can stack up to

256
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,199
two frisbees and four hits using the

257
00:10:46,199 --> 00:10:48,480
skateboard as well but I don't fucking

258
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,320
know

259
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:53,050
riki rat was trying to get Toby turtle

260
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:57,580
to join his gang who's Ricky red who's

261
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:00,310
Toby turtle what a fuck are you

262
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:02,980
he said Toby would have to take some

263
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,230
pills mom well maybe I should go talk to

264
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,250
Ricky rat then and get some

265
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,510
acetaminophen for the headache you

266
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:09,420
giving me right now yeah by the way

267
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,260
skateboarding on the train is most

268
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,390
definitely encouraged kids eventually

269
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:14,980
you make your way out of the subway

270
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:17,350
which was in the suburbs may I remind

271
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:19,030
you you find yourself in another

272
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:21,640
neighborhood that looks exactly like the

273
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,390
last one oh okay then you're supposed to

274
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:27,550
go into another subway

275
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:29,860
how many subway connections I gotta make

276
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,660
to get to my uncle's house maybe my

277
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,950
parents could have given me a ride if

278
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,300
they weren't so busy mauling each

279
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:37,630
other's privates Hanes Levi's Dockers

280
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,520
take a trip to the Gap dad it's not that

281
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:44,670
hard oh okay so this subway is it Castle

282
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:50,700
this one's a a castle it's a castle

283

[Music]

284
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,220
I've been getting there before dark

285
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,389
might have been the least of Wally's

286
00:11:59,389 --> 00:12:01,790
worries hey Wally you think you could

287
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,560
have maybe you know taking a detour

288
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,600
around this part of town this guy's

289
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,310
literally dropping bombs out of his

290
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:10,100
window all day that's that's his job man

291
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,690
I guess the economy really has gotten

292
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:14,120
bad so after you get out of the real

293
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,329
actual demilitarized ghetto where no kid

294
00:12:17,329 --> 00:12:19,790
should ever be you go into this MC

295
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:22,940
Escher garage with a cat man okay I

296
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:25,100
think I think I might be getting a bit

297
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:30,170
of a contact high from this where's my

298
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:35,060
hands I just saw a Larry lizard going

299
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:37,279
into this garage okay wonderful yet

300
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:40,100
another person I have no context for he

301
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,480
was drinking out of a funny-looking

302
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,230
bottle and acting really strange

303
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:49,339
it sounds like Larry's been drinking how

304
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:52,430
do you get that good remember even

305
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:55,399
grown-ups shouldn't drink and try now

306
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:57,230
this really needed to be said I mean all

307
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:58,639
those drunk driving kids were tearing

308
00:12:58,639 --> 00:12:59,470
this country apart

00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:12,530
killed him moving on

all right after it's been this time I've

314
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,460
been caught off guard how exactly did

315
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:25,750
that door lead to this hey Wally don't

316
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,340
forget to take the shortcut to uncle

317
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,200
Gary grizzly shoot a snake cave it's

318
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,940
right after the ice is coming to me guys

319
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,440
the bomb get oh yeah you'll find it

320
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,220
don't worry about it

321
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:36,880
this part is impossible there are just

322
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,830
so many things and there's huge

323
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:42,550
platforming pitfalls everywhere it would

324
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:45,070
take anyone many many tries to even get

325
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:46,060
through this part

326
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,910
and don't forget everything is an ice

327
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,950
level how did this teach kids anything

328
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:52,060
when they couldn't even get to the end

329
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:54,130
of the game to learn the freakin message

331
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:04,060
what the fuck is this supposed to be

332
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:06,820
this game has a chronic condition of

333
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,490
never explaining anything two minutes

334
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:10,780
ago we were in the suburbs now we're

335
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,370
what taking a stroll through Nikolai

336
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:15,070
Tesla secret underground lair apparently

337
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:16,750
according to Wally I gotta infiltrate a

338
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,490
freakin fortress just to get to my

339
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:19,380
uncle's house

341
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:28,380
what fuck I promise I'll never do drugs

342
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:31,290
again dad by the way this is literally

343
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:33,330
the only room in the entire game that's

344
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,760
like this it's it's so out of place

345
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,160
freakin Plato's up here hucking loogies

346
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,140
down at me while I'm trying to balance

347
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,170
the top pillars on a fucking skateboard

348
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:45,870
ladies and gentlemen this is art there's

349
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,820
a million doors here and there's only

350
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,700
one of them that leads to the way out to

351
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,260
get past this part you just got to keep

352
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,210
relentlessly scaling the castle and

353
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:55,800
trying doors until you find the right

354
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:01,190
one come on come on come on yes finally

355
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:05,170
watch out for a man giving away candy

356
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:08,029

357
00:15:08,029 --> 00:15:11,360
underground demon fortress in it and

358
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,639
apparently the subway just passes right

359
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:14,600

360
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,399

00:15:17,689 --> 00:15:18,230

370
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:36,110
until it burns a hole through it

371
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:37,790
this must be what Buzz Aldrin felt like

372
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:44,030
