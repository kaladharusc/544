1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,600
okay guys so the battlefield 5 reveal

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,710
has has happened and it's time for me to

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,300
compare battlefield 5 with call of duty

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:14,519
black ops 4 as I do you know in previous

5
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:17,730
years when these two giants come out

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,260
around the same time with their own

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,020
stuff so so the reveal for Call of Duty

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,630
you know disappointed me highly but the

9
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,090
structure of it the the audience

10
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:30,330
reacting and and the bluster of it was

11
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:31,890
good you know is this predict

12
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,230
traditional sort of press conference you

13
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,920
know stage thing and over here on

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,770
battlefield 5 side you got Trevor Noah

15
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:43,350
making jokes and and kind of taking away

16
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,710
some times of the different features

17
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:49,739
being revealed and then the audience is

18
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:51,120
like dead quiet there's there's no

19
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,280
clapping I add one point forgot there

20
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,539
was an audience until they started

21
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:56,010
clapping when when they said okay now

22
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,079
it's time to show the trailer and then

23
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,579
the like I guess there was a clap

24
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:01,530
applauded message so I just think that

25
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,180
the messaging was real messed up and

26
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,159
that that sort of reveal event was done

27
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:06,960
in a very awkward way there they're like

28
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,520
the sit down like they're on the daily

29
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,080
show and then they do cutaways to like

30
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,939
super interesting information and then

31
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:13,500
okay I'm back to you like we're on a

32
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,689
news show like I don't know who who

33
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:17,340
produced that but I gotta be honest with

34
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,950
you I feel very amateur and and and just

35
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,680
I didn't like it because here's the

36
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,280
thing before that event they did they

37
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,070
three-hour press event and influencers

38
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:32,490
event and they gave us like I've never

39
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:35,670
seen the passion in detail directly from

40
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,320
the developers as they talk about their

41
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,780
individual jobs and features and they

42
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,520
show the animations and how they've

43
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,380
improved and they show this and that it

44
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,439
they show slideshows it blew me away

45
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,780
this battlefield 5 guys when you get

46
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,079
your hands on it it is like wow and and

47
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,470
I wrote a lot of things I wrote 10 pages

48
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:57,869
of notes let me just show you this here

49
00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:01,799
is 10 pages of notes that I took from

50
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:05,759
this reveal while I'm watching it 10

51
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,369
pages of notes all this stuff and kill

52
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:11,819
cancer there's so much in this fucking

53
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:12,599
game with

54
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,219
visual the tides of war visual

55
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:16,379
customization notice I put this in red I

56
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:18,629
spotted a little legendary something

57
00:02:18,629 --> 00:02:20,519
that said legendary and I was like hey I

58
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:24,980
had a follow-up on that and and and so

59
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:27,359
everything that you could have possibly

60
00:02:27,359 --> 00:02:30,510
wanted to know they said there and they

61
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:33,269
had little things so and then too and I

62
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:34,980
was like wow by the end of the three

63
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,019
hours I was like this is long and they

64
00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:38,609
had like intermissions to intermissions

65
00:02:38,609 --> 00:02:40,439
and I was like that was great and

66
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:42,900
anybody that plays Battlefield anybody

67
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,480
that's a video game fan that's a gamer I

68
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,950
don't think you need to be a hardcore

69
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,269
gay okay three hours you need to be

70
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:50,939
hardcore but but but at least it's there

71
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:52,530
and you could take it in chunks I just

72
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:54,599
want them to throw that up you know if

73
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:56,909
they filmed it put that online but I

74
00:02:56,909 --> 00:02:58,230
don't think they're gonna do that and

75
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:00,449
and and I think that they're and I was

76
00:03:00,449 --> 00:03:01,889
hoping to myself that the press reveal

77
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:04,019
where the public reveal would be just as

78
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:07,230
good it's not it there was just I don't

79
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,340
know if the messaging there just got

80
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,919
mixed so I'm gonna do it I'm gonna just

81
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:12,629
give you all of my freaking notes

82
00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:14,400
because I took all of these notes and

83
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,989
and I don't know if they're gonna go

84
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:19,739
anywhere so here is everything about

85
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:22,019
battlefields of five that we know

86
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:24,870
currently and it is so much okay so

87
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:27,199
let's let me just go through it together

88
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:29,639
so they opened that and I'm just gonna

89
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:31,409
give you a rundown of the conference

90
00:03:31,409 --> 00:03:33,090
because these notes are scatterbrained

91
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:35,129
it's gonna be a little difficult here so

92
00:03:35,129 --> 00:03:37,979
if you are our core fan of Battlefield

93
00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:39,989
stick around the rest of you I

94
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:41,549
understand if you're not gonna be able

95
00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:43,379
to take it but it's some really cool

96
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:46,590
stuff okay if you're a fan of well you

97
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,120
know war shooters and things like that

98
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,019
so here we go

99
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:51,120
they started out by started talking

100
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,379
about how they were proud you know

101
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:54,720
battlefield 1942 extremely proud of it

102
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,729
the World War two returns why are they

103
00:03:56,729 --> 00:03:58,859
why are they returning well they started

104
00:03:58,859 --> 00:04:01,019
there and they got and and of course now

105
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:03,150
we're in 2018 and there's been a lot of

106
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,400
technological advancements since then so

107
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,870
they're going back to the roots and they

108
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,669
started challenging themselves about

109
00:04:08,669 --> 00:04:10,620
what world war two what they could do

110
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,900
now and and how they can make it

111
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,969
different and exciting again and from

112
00:04:14,969 --> 00:04:16,919
what I've seen they've accomplished that

113
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:19,109
now obviously I'm away for a review to

114
00:04:19,109 --> 00:04:21,419
give a fool you know confidence in

115
00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:22,830
saying that but from what I've seen I

116
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,539
think it's really gonna nail it now

117
00:04:24,539 --> 00:04:25,520
would I have rather

118
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,090
I've seen a modern modern take I kind of

119
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:31,610
wanted like you know Vietnam or

120
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,560
something like maybe even alternate

121
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,259
history using sort of the Vietnam era

122
00:04:36,259 --> 00:04:39,560
war stuff or operation flashpoint stuff

123
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,050
if you remember that game a long time

124
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:42,500
ago

125
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,449
you know just explore different time

126
00:04:44,449 --> 00:04:46,909
periods yeah I would have wanted that

127
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:48,710
but if we're gonna go back to one more -

128
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:50,389
I'm glad it's dice that's doing it and

129
00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:52,129
I'm glad they're doing it in this way

130
00:04:52,129 --> 00:04:54,590
and adding a whole variety of weapons

131
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,930
and being able to do what war - with our

132
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:59,090
current technology so I'm into it

133
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,909
I'm excited about world war two it's

134
00:05:01,909 --> 00:05:04,490
gonna be a journey around the globe they

135
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:06,110
said there's gonna be some bullshit you

136
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,840
know 5pr terms in here they claim it's

137
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,190
gonna be the richest and deepest and

138
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:12,289
most immersive battlefield 5 that's the

139
00:05:12,289 --> 00:05:13,970
same kind of stuff you'd find in any of

140
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:15,710
these sort of press conferences but then

141
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:17,690
what would blew me away and I didn't

142
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:19,250
quite understand it at first is you've

143
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,380
got a little section I wrote it down my

144
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,750
soldiers my company so you're creating

145
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,250
your own company with new unique

146
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,930
soldiers and vehicles that will go on

147
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:29,360
the journey with you now at first I

148
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,860
thought like wait well is this like an

149
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,409
RPG experience or these guys gonna be on

150
00:05:33,409 --> 00:05:36,139
the actual battlefield and I got that

151
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:37,520
impression through the three hours but I

152
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,979
don't think that's what it was I think

153
00:05:39,979 --> 00:05:41,539
they're just saying in this section you

154
00:05:41,539 --> 00:05:43,550
create your own soldiers that you will

155
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:45,409
use individually in the game and stuff

156
00:05:45,409 --> 00:05:47,210
like that so I don't know if that was

157
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:50,960
kind of mixed messaging or or or sort of

158
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,449
trying to say something that it really

159
00:05:53,449 --> 00:05:56,180
is and or if I just dumbass and didn't

160
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,740
understand it but that's kind of the way

161
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,080
it sounded but I think it's just a whole

162
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,210
section will you'll be able to have deep

163
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:04,880
customization like never before and from

164
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,469
what I saw in the customization they

165
00:06:06,469 --> 00:06:08,900
showed many many options there is a ton

166
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,880
of customization here that we've not

167
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,490
seen in battlefield as some of the

168
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:15,289
recent battlefields like some of the

169
00:06:15,289 --> 00:06:17,330
things as each weapon has like six or

170
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:19,580
seven individual parts and they they

171
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,440
sort of did a flyby that you could put

172
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,659
all sorts of things on it skins and

173
00:06:23,659 --> 00:06:26,479
graving 's the branches you know or two

174
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,690
kind of themed stuff you know weeds from

175
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,849
like sniper guillotine Suit kind of

176
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:34,699
stuff I hope and I suggested that maybe

177
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:37,339
we get some carvings of kills in the

178
00:06:37,339 --> 00:06:38,870
guns or dog tanks

179
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,610
off of it like we've seen in blacklight

180
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:43,400
I want that kind of customization in it

181
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,870
and it looks like we're gonna get some

182
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:47,270
of those things then they talked about

183
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,890
how in their single-player campaign

184
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:51,260
they're gonna be doing unseen untold

185
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,540
unplayed stories and they're gonna

186
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,460
portray those elements in the war

187
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:58,310
stories because the major battles the

188
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,170
ones that we all know they can take care

189
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,540
of that in the new tides of war mode

190
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:05,030
which is sort of this meta mode I was

191
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:06,380
hoping I first I thought it was gonna be

192
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,790
like access and allies and you've got

193
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:09,620
this meta map where you you push back

194
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,060
and forth between the Germans so this is

195
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,530
exactly what I wanted and what I

196
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:15,050
suggested in Call of Duty World War 2

197
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:17,180
and that's the game I'm waiting for and

198
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,280
excited for but I don't think and again

199
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,410
my mind was running away from me I don't

200
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:23,810
think that's what it is it's more it's

201
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,600
it's that but without the map okay

202
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,180
because every week or every three weeks

203
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,250
or whatever it is they can provide us a

204
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,200
new set of like five different things

205
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,850
that you can play through a new grand

206
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:37,280
operation that's themed for the fall of

207
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,650
Europe or you know they talked about

208
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:42,860
examples like the blitzkrieg you can

209
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,210
have the Polish invasion where players

210
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:45,800
are just what would that look like in

211
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,360
battlefield 5 where everybody's just on

212
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,310
tanks and going at it and stuff or one

213
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,590
side isn't on tanks and one side is on

214
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:53,000
tanks and a blitzkrieg you know that

215
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,740
that would be really cool and so they

216
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,330
can do these individual battles and take

217
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:58,130
you all over the world they're gonna do

218
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:59,600
that in war stories but they're also

219
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,300
gonna do it in the operations and the

220
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,790
grand operations in the Arctic and I saw

221
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:07,460
avalanches I was ok so this is gonna

222
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,170
there's an avalanche in that concept art

223
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:11,120
is that LEvolution or we're gonna see

224
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,150
that right and yes dynamic weather is

225
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,710
returning they say they're gonna turn

226
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,210
that up a little bit because that was

227
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:20,000
exciting and and added some dynamic

228
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,010
arrange to the battle so that's gonna be

229
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:24,950
back and so I was really excited about

230
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:27,020
that they talked about north of Arctic

231
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,550
Circle battle across the French

232
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,640
countryside mechanized armies total

233
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,740
devastation of the city of Rotterdam

234
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:36,560
maybe I got that wrong the rugged heat

235
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,380
of the North African desert and take

236
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:41,030
part in the biggest battles ever fought

237
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:43,100
is the you know the branding that they

238
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:47,000
use so let's see your squad is the key

239
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,620
to success your company will evolve with

240
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:52,000
you decide how they play how they look

241
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,800
you they mentioned conquest team

242
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,380
deathmatch domination but one of the big

243
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,030
things is these new feature called

244
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:00,730
fortifications so you'll be because

245
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:02,650
there's a lot of destruction and better

246
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:04,000
and new destruction

247
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,580
I saw tank rolling through a building

248
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,590
and just a building crumbling it looks

249
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,620
so good so realistic so awesome then

250
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,540
they talked about when the when the tank

251
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,790
fires the cannon shot in previous

252
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:16,960
battlefields there'd be a nice

253
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,580
impressive effect it was always

254
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,650
impressive but here the physics are also

255
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:22,420
correct we're impressive and that that

256
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:25,240
blows inward otherwise or another

257
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,190
example was they fired the shot through

258
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:28,840
the window it exploded in the house and

259
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,160
then this time the house exploded

260
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,950
outward instead of using the same canned

261
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:34,750
animation that they would have used last

262
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:38,050
time so that was really cool and so what

263
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:40,000
that is is they've talked about

264
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,370
fortifications where you can counter the

265
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:45,430
destruction okay and fortify the flags

266
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:48,160
and strong points and then they they

267
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,600
supplement this with the new towing

268
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,880
mechanic where you could tow things and

269
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,500
vehicles so there's gonna be lots of

270
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,470
anti-aircraft gun emplacements is a

271
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,180
stationary gun emplacements that are

272
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,760
really good machine gun emplacements and

273
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,370
you can you can tow these things on any

274
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,800
vehicle well most any vehicle I'm not

275
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,420
sure any vehicle you know tanks will be

276
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,040
able to do it transports would be able

277
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,630
to do it and while you're driving you

278
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:12,460
can have somebody sitting that thing and

279
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,260
fire it and you see some of that in the

280
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,150
trailer and they talked about creating

281
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,760
these little trains you could drive

282
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,880
around vehicles that are towing until

283
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,680
you get to the position that your your

284
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,630
forces are combined trying to make a

285
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:27,940
fortification together and set set up

286
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:30,250
the stationary things there it sounded

287
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,110
so cool it sounded like this is the

288
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:35,140
single addition to battlefield 5 and it

289
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,330
makes so much sense because that's how

290
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:38,920
war is actually war you got to fortify

291
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,170
the positions that are valuable and it

292
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:43,020
just makes encountering these

293
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,830
fortifications that much more

294
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:47,950
interesting also the tide in squad

295
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:50,860
squads have way more importance here

296
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,630
when you spawn you're spawning in a

297
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:55,170
squad squad leaders have more

298
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:57,820
responsibilities they've got radios that

299
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,980
they can call in they showed so many

300
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,930
different things that you can call in

301
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:04,810
I'm seeing if I wrote any of them down

302
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:05,080
at

303
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:10,600
have been so dang quick I found it okay

304
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,710
so I wrote down a v1 or J BT JB two

305
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:17,260
rockets so v1 rockets and you saw that

306
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,880
in the trailer too so if you're gonna

307
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,740
have these big fortifications you know

308
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,630
and your squad has been playing the

309
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:24,460
objective and playing together and doing

310
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,380
things around you'll be able to call in

311
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,640
you're gonna be able to use those points

312
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,230
calling up each of rocket on those

313
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:32,700
positions or if v1 rocket Supply Drop

314
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,520
smokescreen barrage is heavy weapons

315
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,230
battle pickups these weren't they said

316
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,430
these weren't specialists they're not

317
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:41,320
going to change your class and they're

318
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,610
just going to be this heavy weapon that

319
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:44,290
you can use while and while you're still

320
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:46,420
your other class so that was really cool

321
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:48,040
and then they also talked about hero

322
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,200
vehicles you can call in this freaking

323
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,720
badass Churchill crocodile if you're on

324
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,390
the British side or the strong tiger if

325
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:56,800
you're on the German I'm not sure if I

326
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,370
said that right

327
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:59,890
but these tanks look so amazing because

328
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:01,960
they were they they were like customized

329
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,970
they had all these sandbags on them and

330
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:07,030
it just it made World War two look so

331
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:10,900
beautiful and you know from the

332
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,840
technology these days so you get access

333
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,150
to all that other stuff now and they're

334
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:19,510
enhancing working together in squads and

335
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:21,760
spawning on each other another thing

336
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,550
they talked about is how they wanted to

337
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:26,650
give players and squads more information

338
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:29,530
so you'll get an over the head shot of

339
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:31,570
what your squad mates are doing so say

340
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:33,760
you died the new mechanic happens you

341
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,500
kind of sit there and you and you can

342
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,930
either call for help or let yourself

343
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:40,300
bleed out and it was brutal dude the

344
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,270
dude is literally screaming ah you know

345
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:45,220
like and you hear this stuff if you're

346
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:48,910
in the the sound design is so amazing in

347
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:51,610
the game guys it reminded me a bad

348
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:54,490
company too that's how and I love the

349
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:56,290
sound design in that game and and since

350
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:57,940
then they've kind of changed the sounds

351
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,800
here and there they still sound good but

352
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,840
I just I just remember that sound design

353
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,430
being wow I'm gonna remember this for

354
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:05,590
forever because of how good that moment

355
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,120
was crackling in the background and then

356
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,580
the battle gets closer that is in here

357
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,770
and so your guys screaming in it for

358
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:13,300
help and he's bleeding and there's

359
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,280
constant and that was a new thing for

360
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,320
them that they wanted to immerse you you

361
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,880
ever play Far Cry 2

362
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,230
you I think it was where you're in

363
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:22,120
Africa where everything is constantly

364
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,890
Mercia whipping up a map you're looking

365
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:25,690
at each other the way you move and stuff

366
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:28,630
it feels like that and I loved that game

367
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:29,890
and I love that it's here and you're

368
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:31,090
looking at your blood while you're

369
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:33,730
screaming and you could do 360 view you

370
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,110
know while you're calling people over

371
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:36,610
but let's just say you kill it you you

372
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:40,390
say okay I'm in a bad position you bleed

373
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:43,930
out you you then get a camera where you

374
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:46,120
zoom in and you're over the shoulder

375
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,680
we're what your other squad mates are

376
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,660
doing before you spawn in on them so

377
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,740
you're gonna have that battlefield

378
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,660
situational awareness that's probably

379
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,100
just simulated but they're on the radio

380
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,350
and like you come join me without even

381
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:59,230
having to talk and then they added like

382
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:02,710
every single soldier can now revive so

383
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:04,780
everybody is technically a medic but

384
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,550
you're gonna be a shitty medic it's

385
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:07,660
gonna take you forever you're gonna do

386
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,070
that patching up member they want to do

387
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:10,420
this first-person kind of always

388
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,340
immersed in the game you're patching up

389
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:14,140
so you would never do that out in the

390
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,700
open cuz it just takes too long and

391
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:18,640
you're at risk your target medics can do

392
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,110
it because it's a lot faster so if

393
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,030
you're an actual medic there's an actual

394
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:24,550
purpose unlike call of duty black ops

395
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:26,200
for which I have no idea why there's a

396
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,270
medic makes no sense cuz the time to

397
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:30,790
kill is ridiculous it does jack shit and

398
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,170
they're just stuffing it in there for no

399
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:33,100
reason cuz they needed another

400
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,440
specialist here the medic actually has a

401
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,360
purpose you not only can you hail

402
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,000
lightning quick but when you heal you're

403
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,740
healing them up to full health say if

404
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,390
you weren't a medic when you heal

405
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:44,950
somebody you don't even heal them up to

406
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:47,020
full health you heal them in a fraction

407
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,520
but you at least get them back into the

408
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,550
battle and and so it still has purpose

409
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:53,440
like that you can now actually grab

410
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,880
people you know that moment where you're

411
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,740
dragging somebody I think it was in Call

412
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,120
of Duty what would do in the

413
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,220
single-player and now and then this felt

414
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:02,110
so good well now that's in multiplayer

415
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:05,680
in battlefield where you know what was

416
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,870
that map operation something where that

417
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,880
the hallways are just so small and

418
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,220
you're trying to remember your die over

419
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,200
and over because it takes too long to

420
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,750
revive well now you can drag that person

421
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,280
very quickly you're dragging them and

422
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,470
get them to safety and then rub heal

423
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:22,870
them you know and it's just it's oh oh

424
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:26,110
great that's gonna be awesome so what

425
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:28,980
else did I write down here dalla Lula

426
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:32,290
they talked about this the you know they

427
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:32,830
settle

428
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:34,540
out of buzz they said a buzzword that

429
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,550
concern man for the live service live

430
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:39,760
service about the tides of operations so

431
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,990
that concerned me a little bit

432
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:42,700
however they put those to fear when they

433
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,160
said there's no premium pass there's no

434
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,470
paid DLC in that kind of expansions

435
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:49,420
there's no like paid expansions they

436
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,550
just give you the expansion they just

437
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:54,250
continue to make this a game that

438
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,900
evolves you're gonna get the fall over

439
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,610
Europe later on you'll get this later on

440
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:59,620
you'll get that and they'll present new

441
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,480
weapons and then when you participate in

442
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,700
these campaigns with campaigns week

443
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,100
three I saw that you oh you can unlock a

444
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,110
new weapon you know skin or something

445
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:10,120
like that for participating in there a

446
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,070
new ban or a new badge and so I thought

447
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:13,270
that's a clever way to keep people

448
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:15,880
playing and people keep people engaged

449
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,260
with the game I think they're gonna get

450
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,870
that right with battlefield 5 now what's

451
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:22,180
the catch what's the catch EA cuz

452
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,550
there's always a catch so far I haven't

453
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,260
found the catch yet I'm gonna keep

454
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,910
looking maybe in my notes I've got it

455
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,050
here later remember that thing I

456
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:31,750
highlighted red we'll see okay and then

457
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,280
they showed the battlefield trailer and

458
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,440
I tried to notate some of the things I

459
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,120
notice in the battlefield trailer right

460
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,460
away there's female in it so you're

461
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:42,420
gonna have one ignorant stupid fucking

462
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:45,520
disgusting side of the internet the dark

463
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,350
corners just are fucking freaking out

464
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:52,570

467
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,770

471
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:04,690
going on in your life either you stop

472
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,510
reading those those forums and pull

473
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:09,850
yourself out of the muck dude cuz yeah I

474
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:11,980
had a laugh about it too in Call of Duty

475
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,240
World War 2 you remember there was a

476
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,699
black female Nazi soldier on

477
00:17:15,699 --> 00:17:16,480
multiplayers

478
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,490
I made a bot made a joke about it and

479
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:20,740
then how there there's women on the

480
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,780
front lines of the shores or d-day of

481
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:26,050
dormant in Normandy Beach invasion when

482
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:27,699
they're opening their cards but that was

483
00:17:27,699 --> 00:17:29,490
for a joke you know I know I honestly

484
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:32,050
don't care it's the fifth Battlefield

485
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:34,510
game it's the 19th Call of Duty if they

486
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:36,820
want to put females what the fuck ever

487
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,170
because there's so much deeper

488
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:39,700
customization I want as many

489
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,400
customization options as possible so I I

490
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,920
want a smaller hitbox with a female you

491
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,510
know

492
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:47,040
that's the kind of thing I think about

493
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,230
so I don't mind that there's females in

494
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:53,160
it so just shut up if you don't get away

495
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,980
from me you know kind of thing it felt a

496
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,570
lot more intimate in those buildings

497
00:17:57,570 --> 00:17:59,910
they showed I think they purposefully

498
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:01,140
went into that building to show there's

499
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,210
gonna be plenty of buildings is one of

500
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:04,980
the criticisms that'll be a one maybe

501
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,630
there wasn't a whole lot of building

502
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:08,310
interaction and verticality I think

503
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,630
there's gonna be more of that here

504
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,640
they've showed some towing weapons in

505
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,400
there it's just hilarious how over the

506
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,590
top and ridiculous it is it seemed like

507
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:18,360
a cinematic but then they kind of

508
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,370
mixture did in with the gameplay later

509
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:23,220
on and that's probably how the game is

510
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,990
gonna be a mixture of cinematic just

511
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:26,460
because graphics are so good these days

512
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:29,850
it's hard to tell but it's like okay

513
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:31,230
Call of Duty's not doing their campaign

514
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,940
anybody and anybody that missed the

515
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,620
over-the-top Call of Duty campaign

516
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,360
single-player can come and get it here

517
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,590
because it looks like that's what we're

518
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:40,650
getting so I thought that was nice and

519
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:43,230
just some one other thing that this

520
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:45,210
year's battlefield 5 has over Call of

521
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:48,240
Duty let's see squad picks up grenade I

522
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,190
don't know what I mean him by that v1

523
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:52,740
rocket explodes firing the machine gun

524
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,930
as he's crawling to the left so that's

525
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:56,730
another emphasis that they put that is

526
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:59,160
in the game now you know how when you

527
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,290
would bunny hop hop off a building or

528
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:02,970
something like that off of roof we put

529
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:04,100
the fire here

530
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,960
way down like the animation would have

531
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,789
the gun put up or pull up or something

532
00:19:07,789 --> 00:19:09,679
like that or when you're done or when

533
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:10,970
you're diving or you're on you know

534
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:14,150
going back going backwards they now they

535
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:16,250
say any time your gun is forward and

536
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,289
it's almost always forward you're gonna

537
00:19:18,289 --> 00:19:20,419
fire so you can fire when you're leaping

538
00:19:20,419 --> 00:19:22,039
over stuff you can fire when you're when

539
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:24,289
you're jumping off a roof or something

540
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:27,230
like that and a lot of they showed off

541
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:30,440
all these amazing animations like you

542
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,000
could do this thing where if somebody's

543
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,890
chasing you and you can run into a house

544
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:37,789
and then jump spin around on your back

545
00:19:37,789 --> 00:19:39,860
and you fall on your back and let's say

546
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:42,440
you got a shotgun you pappa while you're

547
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,169
on the ground prone and and while a guy

548
00:19:45,169 --> 00:19:47,210
comes around the corner it was fuckin it

549
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:49,309
was the potential of that is cool I

550
00:19:49,309 --> 00:19:50,510
don't know how that's gonna wear to

551
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:52,130
multiplayer is gonna be abused is it

552
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:53,480
gonna be buddy humping all the time I

553
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,289
don't think so

554
00:19:54,289 --> 00:19:56,630
I hope not but it's just so much more

555
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,640
fluid and they use this example of how

556
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,900
they thought players thought it was

557
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,400
annoying or game-changers or whoever

558
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,780
thought it was annoying that when you

559
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,850
when you crouch down in a corner and

560
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:07,280
you're prone and your feet like hit you

561
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,750
know you could get knocked off in the

562
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,340
animation like pushes your character and

563
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,840
then you'll fall off of whatever perch

564
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,820
you were on well now that no longer

565
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,530
happens and they were trying to find

566
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:17,150
ways to make that more realistic so your

567
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:19,100
soldier sits and Thrones in a very

568
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:22,220
realistic 360 kind of way and that goes

569
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:24,980
a long way I mean so melee weapons in

570
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:27,679
the trailer so we're gonna see that you

571
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:29,809
see the dude sliding down the hill so we

572
00:20:29,809 --> 00:20:31,700
kind of have a little bit of that sort

573
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,940
of enhanced movement not quite jump Jets

574
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,559
or anything like that but there is I

575
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,120
don't know if there's shotgun slides

576
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,610
they they say they're still working on

577
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:42,710
the balancing of the shotguns and they

578
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:45,289
may you know look at how that works but

579
00:20:45,289 --> 00:20:46,669
that could be a potential I mean look at

580
00:20:46,669 --> 00:20:48,770
the way that guy's sliding and then

581
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:51,500
we've got that female with the fake arm

582
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,059
with the cyborg she's a cyborg

583
00:20:53,059 --> 00:20:56,510
from this anybody screaming orders no

584
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:59,150
words or historical accuracy shut the

585
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:01,250
fuck it you should be more mad that

586
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,230
there's a cyborg arm in the game than

587
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:04,820
there is a female because there actually

588
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,679
were women in combat in one word - I

589
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:07,880
don't know if you know this not very

590
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,360
many

591
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,070
I agree but a lot of the resistance

592
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,990
fighters and I'm actually happy we're

593
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:14,750
getting these war stories of untold

594
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,340
stories that I told you that they were

595
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,990
trying to focus on and that's

596
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:20,030
why you're seeing a few women in here

597
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:23,240
these Norwegian resistance fighters and

598
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,690
and and you know and I saw all they

599
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:28,460
showed is like if six seconds of it

600
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:30,950
where she falls in some water and and I

601
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:32,720
was like okay I'm interested at what's

602
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,730
going on here how the hell is they're

603
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:37,460
gonna beat the Nazis I have no idea what

604
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,050
the story's about but I am very

605
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:41,840
intrigued and we're gonna get all the

606
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,730
big historical battle kind of stuff but

607
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:45,320
I also want to see the untold stories of

608
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,179
World War two this is the fifth game for

609
00:21:47,179 --> 00:21:49,760
Christ's sake and probably the 90th

610
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,770
World War two game it's okay at this

611
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:54,920
point they also had radios blaring on

612
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,559
the jeeps so that returns from call of a

613
00:21:57,559 --> 00:22:00,800
Call of Duty battlefield vietnam and so

614
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,710
that'd be fun World War two music you

615
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:05,840
know fucking blasting want you while

616
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,250
you're riding that thing if shooting is

617
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:10,250
gonna be bringing on so much the way by

618
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,530
pods are deployed or they said there's

619
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:13,970
gonna be instant and I think you see

620
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:15,920
that in the in the trailer so by pods

621
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,679
have been improved LMGs have been

622
00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:21,770
improved there's a sort of sort of

623
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:23,360
character development for your squad and

624
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,130
that's what I didn't quite understand

625
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:27,380
that kind of thing and I'm a little

626
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:30,890
mixed up on that alright so and I wrote

627
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:32,990
here battlefield not chasing that battle

628
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:35,240
royale fat they're actually evolving

629
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,400
their core gameplay experiences and

630
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,320
actually experimenting with it in a

631
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,600
legit way you know it's just so

632
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,429
disappointing to me that it's like

633
00:22:43,429 --> 00:22:45,260
battlefield or it's like Call of Duty

634
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,179
it's not even Call of Duty why even call

635
00:22:47,179 --> 00:22:50,330
it black ops for it you you you're doing

636
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:53,120
Rainbow six you're doing overwatch and

637
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,429
you're doing fortnight that's what

638
00:22:55,429 --> 00:22:55,970
you're doing

639
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:59,929
we're that's it oh and zombies thanks

640
00:22:59,929 --> 00:23:02,840
you know I'm not into the zombies mode

641
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,420
many of you are and that's fair but now

642
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:08,000
you have a zombies gladiator gladiator

643
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,390
zombies you know so I don't know I just

644
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,280
think that that's not even a war game

645
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,370
anymore and it just doesn't feel right

646
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:18,140
so so the evolution is in the wrong

647
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,540
direction here the evolution is every

648
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:23,960
single aspect of what makes this

649
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,900
combined-arms battlefield experience has

650
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,000
been evolved and improved and a step

651
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,280
forward in my opinion plus

652
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,380
new mode so you want zombies well

653
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,910
battlefield says we'll give you will

654
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:36,230
give you that zombies mode but we're

655
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:39,680
gonna do it in a real war historical way

656
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,020
not not zombies but paratroopers and

657
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,540
what we was like for them on dynamic

658
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:46,640
maps that change all the friggin time

659
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,530
and they can evolve and create these

660
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:50,630
little mini stories with you and your

661
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,370
buddies do you continue to go forward

662
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:54,470
and you notice he mentioned all this

663
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:56,300
scarcity that's a big thing in

664
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,580
battlefield 5 that's changing you're

665
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,050
you're not always gonna spawn in when

666
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:01,160
you respawn you're not gonna have full

667
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,170
ammo you're gonna have to go to resupply

668
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:04,520
areas you're gonna have to ask your

669
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,200
squad mates for ammunition you're gonna

670
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,820
know that you only have you know one

671
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:11,150
magazine and you know and how do you

672
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:13,100
approach this situation you you know you

673
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,590
they wanted to have that game flow be a

674
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:18,230
little different and encourage squad

675
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:20,960
play so scarcity is there and that's

676
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,910
gonna show up not only in a co-op mode

677
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:26,120
but also in multiplayer customization

678
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,250
like I said is huge I wrote down here it

679
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:30,410
looks like Braveheart yeah and we even

680
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:32,570
I've got a war god of war makes an

681
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:33,200
appearance

682
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,650
and so it's like battlefield khaliv or

683
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:39,320
uh I'm just mixing all the games

684
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,690
together now there's face paints there's

685
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:44,630
jackets the pants are selectable I saw

686
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:46,100
one guy with a watch I don't know if

687
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,050
watches are individual or if that was

688
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:50,270
just a part of the jacket upper body

689
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:52,670
part I I I'm gonna go ahead and just

690
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:55,700
expect it's uh it's a hat

691
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,490
face upper body lower body prepare

692
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:00,440
yourselves for that okay and that I

693
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,420
think for is the customization get any

694
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:03,830
more than that than that and that's

695
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,660
gonna be above and beyond the call of

696
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:08,180
duty but it's already above and beyond

697
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,440
the call of duty

698
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,330
but yeah so then they talked about

699
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:14,150
combined arms a little bit more side

700
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:15,830
narratives they got that narrative

701
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:18,560
generator in that online cooperative

702
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,300
mode there it's the issues of the

703
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:24,170
paratroopers okay and then everything

704
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:25,910
that you do in combined arms and war

705
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:28,790
stories will unlock to feed your company

706
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:30,740
feed your company new weapons new

707
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:34,880
unlocks new badges new banners new face

708
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,670
paint new sandbags and customizations

709
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:40,100
for your tanks it sounded awesome

710
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:43,490
um let's see

711
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:45,950
so talking they talked a little bit

712
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:48,110
about that story a little bit more so

713
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,130
here's what it is

714
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:52,070
one such war story is you're playing as

715
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:54,620
a young resistance fighter in Norway

716
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,870
it's about saving your family it's up

717
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:59,149
close it's personal it's portraying

718
00:25:59,149 --> 00:26:00,890
these human stories that aren't

719
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:03,169
historical okay they mentioned that so

720
00:26:03,169 --> 00:26:05,240
many times to try to hammer it into our

721
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,770
heads it's not historical but it

722
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:08,870
represents what these people might have

723
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:10,760
been going through and I'm up for it

724
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,190
I'm Bart in honor I thought it was fine

725
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:15,409
yeah it's not historical okay we could

726
00:26:15,409 --> 00:26:17,120
do a little different we could do we'd

727
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,399
go over the top like Call of Duty does

728
00:26:19,399 --> 00:26:21,500
in in their campaigns and I've always

729
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,360
liked Call of Duty's single-player

730
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,250
campaigns oh they're so over the top so

731
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:28,789
I'm ready for it all right we see if I

732
00:26:28,789 --> 00:26:30,669
can break down some more of this for you

733
00:26:30,669 --> 00:26:36,289
what are we on we're on page two gonna

734
00:26:36,289 --> 00:26:39,740
have to scan through this in the core

735
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,450
gameplay mechanics they had four pillar

736
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:44,029
squad play physical and kinetic war of

737
00:26:44,029 --> 00:26:47,149
attrition variety and flexibility so how

738
00:26:47,149 --> 00:26:49,190
you let's just skip to the important

739
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:51,799
ones they're the physical soldiers every

740
00:26:51,799 --> 00:26:53,990
action requires input it's physical

741
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:56,029
representation they're moving away from

742
00:26:56,029 --> 00:26:58,130
anything that's abstract so there's no

743
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:00,470
aura healing you've got to interact with

744
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:02,659
the ammo they're like hand the hand

745
00:27:02,659 --> 00:27:04,730
picks up the ammo or your squad made you

746
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:06,710
catch it in the air you pick it up from

747
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:07,789
the ground member when I was talking

748
00:27:07,789 --> 00:27:09,980
about like Far Cry 2 that's in the game

749
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:12,950
there's no more holding the spot button

750
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:15,559
and spotting torito's and then firing at

751
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:17,960
those Doritos with your finger not even

752
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,820
on the trigger and then and you know

753
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,649
instead it's always on that spotting

754
00:27:21,649 --> 00:27:23,059
button the spotting mechanics gonna be

755
00:27:23,059 --> 00:27:24,500
different they didn't want to share what

756
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,390
it is but I think I inferred from

757
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:28,669
talking to many different people that

758
00:27:28,669 --> 00:27:30,980
it's a mark mechanic you're you're

759
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:33,529
you're calling out a specific thing that

760
00:27:33,529 --> 00:27:35,120
people need to pay attention to so it'll

761
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,309
be a ping or it'll be a single kind of

762
00:27:37,309 --> 00:27:40,039
thing rather than a bunch of Doritos but

763
00:27:40,039 --> 00:27:42,559
I'm not sure another thing they said is

764
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,120
that you know you can fire through

765
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,770
buildings I mean these are some of these

766
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:47,720
weapons are really powerful and so an

767
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,309
example was a squad going up to the

768
00:27:49,309 --> 00:27:51,260
second you know level of the house and

769
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:53,660
getting that LMG and just going

770
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:55,550
and you took out a few of them and you

771
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:57,470
got him hit indicators that you're

772
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:59,390
hitting a few of the people in there so

773
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:01,490
don't worry about not having enough

774
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:03,860
feedback about what you're doing cuz you

775
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:06,040
will and they've thought of that

776
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,630
believable reactions a deep connection

777
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:11,270
to your surroundings what they said they

778
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:12,940
wanted to mix up those gameplay loops

779
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,720
scarcity already talked to you about

780
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,860
that

781
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,630
every time you spawn you're not maxed

782
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:19,190
out you have to gear up you have to have

783
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:21,230
that preparation before your hand head

784
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:23,570
out and a lot of this stuff is actually

785
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:25,220
starting these resupply areas and these

786
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,740
buildable things it's starting to sound

787
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:30,470
like squad and that is a really exciting

788
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:32,660
thing for me because I played squad and

789
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:35,290
I fucking love it it is this amazing

790
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:37,730
simulation and it just simulates these

791
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:39,800
things in war that like you know that

792
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,570
preparation and then you know you're

793
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:43,190
driving a supply truck or you're going

794
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:47,630
trying to reinforce an area and then you

795
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:50,480
know and boma dynamic battle just starts

796
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,640
and it's just so immersive and this shit

797
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,620
is was already in battlefield but now

798
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:56,420
with this stuff and taking cues from

799
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:58,880
that it's opening it's upping it

800
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,460
so whereas Call of Duty Black Ops is is

801
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:04,700
taking from fucking Battle Royale right

802
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,380
when you got one life you're gonna be

803
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,910
walking around for 15 minutes sure it

804
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:10,160
may be factions and sides right but

805
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,200
you're gonna die and that's it you have

806
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,720
nothing to do whereas a metal field you

807
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,850
you've got these these dynamic moments

808
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:18,350
and then you die and then you respawn on

809
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:20,720
your squad and then you find ways around

810
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,850
it and you take down that tank with you

811
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:24,530
know so it's just a completely different

812
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:27,160
experience I'll try to calm down on the

813
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,180
expectations but I remember this is

814
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:31,100
partly a comparison video between these

815
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:33,410
two games so that's why I bring it up so

816
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:35,570
much so umm what else can I give you

817
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:36,980
that they're gonna change their

818
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:38,990
communication really give you a wide

819
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:42,230
range of experiences on maps and they

820
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:43,970
kind of actually embrace them they said

821
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:45,710
we like it when players hate our maps

822
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:47,210
sometimes they didn't say like that but

823
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:49,010
they were like we like some players will

824
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:50,780
love and hate certain maps that's just

825
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,490
that's encouraged because what it does

826
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:54,650
is it says um certain maps cater certain

827
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:56,030
things so you're gonna have fun you're

828
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:58,190
gonna have a you know a dogfight Maps

829
00:29:58,190 --> 00:29:59,840
you're gonna have tank oriented Maps

830
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,070
you're gonna have little hallway

831
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:03,590
operation you know alway Maps and you're

832
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:05,060
gonna have all that kind of stuff in

833
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,470
this game too and they

834
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:07,789
want to shy away from that and then

835
00:30:07,789 --> 00:30:10,750
they'll have the mixed Maps as well

836
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:12,559
communication on what's coming up in

837
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:14,630
future DLCs there's always gonna be

838
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:16,789
something new and cool coming and all

839
00:30:16,789 --> 00:30:18,740
this stuff is gonna be free I don't see

840
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:23,600
a problem with that I I'm like wow no no

841
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,450
yay what is the catch we'll see we'll

842
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:27,230
see what the catch is

843
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:29,630
it's service focus see this is the kind

844
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:31,400
of stuff that that worries me service

845
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,130
focus built to last bill for expansions

846
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:36,380
and it's smart that's the way to do it

847
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:38,150
so I don't know if they're talking about

848
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:40,820
battlefield 5 Japan in these times and

849
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,230
then all of a sudden you'll get Japanese

850
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:44,299
and Japanese weapons Japanese tanks and

851
00:30:44,299 --> 00:30:46,520
then Call of Duty Italy and all of a

852
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,110
sudden you'll see I own Call of Duty

853
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:50,510
battlefield Italy sorry about that I

854
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:52,520
don't know if that's really what's gonna

855
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,559
happen because then doesn't that make

856
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:58,250
battlefield 6 and 7 obsolete but I know

857
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:00,799
that there's it's gonna be stories that

858
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,600
they tell along with you in these grand

859
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,059
campaigns but it sounds like they're

860
00:31:05,059 --> 00:31:06,770
setting up that they're laying the

861
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:09,380
groundwork for all that exciting sound

862
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:11,000
sounding shit in the future whether

863
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,559
that's with battlefield fiber in the

864
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:17,630
future ok physical and kinetic immersive

865
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:19,549
I saw an avalanche in the Norway picture

866
00:31:19,549 --> 00:31:22,250
traversal low latency they want to

867
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:23,690
concentrate on that wide range of

868
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:26,720
options so now you're met and they use

869
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,580
this example jumping straight out of a

870
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:30,020
window instead of whacking out that

871
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,580
window like let's say you even got that

872
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,559
window cover you have to whack at it

873
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:35,630
over and over to break it first and then

874
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:37,669
run out well they said all that stuff is

875
00:31:37,669 --> 00:31:39,679
gonna be contextual now if you see a

876
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:41,360
tank rolling up and that happens in the

877
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,770
trailer you see the tank roll you just

878
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:44,960
start running for the window boom you

879
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,820
are you will jump through it you know

880
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,770
and you won't have to do this and that

881
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:50,809
and then when you slam on to that ground

882
00:31:50,809 --> 00:31:52,100
you'll take a little bit of damage but

883
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,690
you'll roll forward for that better

884
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:55,159
traversal in the way your character

885
00:31:55,159 --> 00:31:57,500
interacts with the terrain so that alone

886
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,410
was really

887
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:00,840
cool for hardcore players like me and to

888
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,400
get that experience it's gonna be really

889
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,980
awesome in a nice gameplay and you know

890
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:07,380
how call of duty black ops 4 made this

891
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,540
huge thing about their new gun system

892
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:12,540
and recoil system well they battlefield

893
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:14,040
is doing that same thing so that kind of

894
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,660
takes that away they're both improving

895
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:17,400
their guns and so there's no longer a

896
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,230
bullet point even though it is a bullet

897
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:20,730
point because it's friggin awesome and

898
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:23,190
pun intended so it's gonna be readable

899
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:25,410
actual recoils the more like visual

900
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:28,020
recoils lots of changes to the weapon

901
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:30,150
feedback so that you can learn them and

902
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:32,670
you can instill they talked about skill

903
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:34,470
and learning those weapons and making

904
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:36,150
each weapon feel different through that

905
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:37,560
system so we're gonna get a little bit

906
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:40,680
of that then they showed some animations

907
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:43,080
while we got this sneak peek into the

908
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,730
the traversal so running through the

909
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:47,040
water that the little guys legs are

910
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,540
going real high you know how awkward it

911
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:50,070
is kind of run through water your guy

912
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:51,870
will do that I thought that was fun and

913
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:54,090
then they do all these reactions to the

914
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:55,980
environment the player stumbles a little

915
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:59,190
bit over you know the rocks and then he

916
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:00,750
puts his body of his weight into the

917
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,480
wall when he goes up against the wall

918
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,010
you could do these little micro drums if

919
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:06,600
you're running on that kind of rule you

920
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,640
know looking terrain if you're running

921
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,350
through mud you're gonna kind of slip

922
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:13,140
and slide and that adds a lot more life

923
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:15,150
to the animations and I don't think I

924
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:18,960
can show you any of that but what the

925
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,640
first thought that pops in your head I

926
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,020
know it just popped in your head now is

927
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:23,910
oh shit that's gonna mess with my aiming

928
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:25,320
and that's gonna be father just fucked

929
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,460
everything is gonna be awful

930
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:28,770
well my first impression was I want all

931
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:30,900
that I don't mind but they said nope

932
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,820
none of that is gonna affect gameplay

933
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:35,400
and aiming you don't notice them in

934
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,560
first-person this is only for the

935
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,630
third-person ambiance so they put a lot

936
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:41,480
of they put some people's fears to rest

937
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:44,490
it's just a visual look and and it

938
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:46,890
really brings together this next-gen

939
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:49,530
experience of battlefield 5 without

940
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:51,240
affecting the gameplay that you know and

941
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:54,210
love and they show tallgrass hiding a

942
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:57,030
soldier and how the grass Moo is moving

943
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:58,890
aside realistically and that's how

944
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:00,180
others are gonna know that you're moving

945
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,740
through that tall grass instead of it

946
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,300
being you know the static thing that it

947
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,040
just IDEs you and some other games and

948
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,450
you just shoot them through there does

949
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:09,210
it's the grass is gonna rustle and stuff

950
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:10,590
when you're when you're interacting with

951
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,369
it

952
00:34:12,369 --> 00:34:14,839
another thing was you remember what I'm

953
00:34:14,839 --> 00:34:16,879
talking about far cry 2 everything so

954
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:18,740
people get up and close with the

955
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:20,059
character so when you're reviving

956
00:34:20,059 --> 00:34:24,319
something they're gonna get up in your

957
00:34:24,319 --> 00:34:27,230
face so you get to and why well not only

958
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:28,849
for the immersion but it's a clever way

959
00:34:28,849 --> 00:34:30,740
to show their customization you'll see

960
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:32,389
their jacket you'll see their face paint

961
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:34,190
you'll see their there their goggles or

962
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:36,169
whatever it is and it creates that

963
00:34:36,169 --> 00:34:37,819
deeper connection between these two

964
00:34:37,819 --> 00:34:39,319
players that you're healing you almost

965
00:34:39,319 --> 00:34:41,329
feel a connection with that guy when you

966
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:43,760
sleep begging in in your face and and

967
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,349
then you kind of want to follow him you

968
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:47,899
know and and and it'll be his friend and

969
00:34:47,899 --> 00:34:49,760
stuff so I just thought that that was

970
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,889
really cool I already talked about the

971
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:53,359
ability for you to drag your team's to

972
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:56,000
safety it's a you know operation Locker

973
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,220
you'll have an ability to get them out

974
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:01,880
of there let's see I already talked

975
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,980
about anybody can revive there's a buddy

976
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,750
revival and then there's the medic the

977
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:07,400
bet it could do it quicker and could do

978
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,650
it to anybody on the battlefield and it

979
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:12,559
heals them back to full if and that's

980
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:13,940
another thing it you can't revive

981
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,980
anybody if you're not a medic just your

982
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,750
own squad that's always called Buddy

983
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:21,349
revival or squad revival but the medic

984
00:35:21,349 --> 00:35:23,569
can heal anybody on the battlefield I'm

985
00:35:23,569 --> 00:35:25,430
not sure enemies I don't think that's

986
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:28,280
the best thing I talked about how the

987
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,079
tank rolling through the building so I'm

988
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:32,299
just going through my notes a little at

989
00:35:32,299 --> 00:35:34,609
a time here it's like bad company two

990
00:35:34,609 --> 00:35:37,490
levels of destruction you know and or or

991
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:39,650
more or maybe not more because they did

992
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:41,299
talk about how sometimes you know they

993
00:35:41,299 --> 00:35:42,440
got a little carried away with

994
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,150
destruction and shit would be flat they

995
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:46,069
don't want to go that far you know so

996
00:35:46,069 --> 00:35:48,049
the building structure will be taken out

997
00:35:48,049 --> 00:35:49,490
but the skeleton will still be there

998
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:50,960
because of the new system of doing

999
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,790
fortifications so on that second level

1000
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:54,500
you can create that fortification and it

1001
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,210
looks cool on there or in this level

1002
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:58,069
this hollowed out piece you've got this

1003
00:35:58,069 --> 00:35:59,750
fortification that you can build there

1004
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:01,670
so they needed that structure to still

1005
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:04,730
stay there for for the fortification

1006
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:08,809
system I already talked about the full

1007
00:36:08,809 --> 00:36:12,369
360 control when you're pro prone but

1008
00:36:12,369 --> 00:36:15,170
going back to you know the scarcity and

1009
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:16,640
stuff every time you kill an enemy he's

1010
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,829
gonna drop ammo so scarcity is a bit

1011
00:36:18,829 --> 00:36:20,510
prevalent it creates these more epic

1012
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:21,770
moments and decisions what they were

1013
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:22,970
saying

1014
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:25,369
and it shakes up the old game play loot

1015
00:36:25,369 --> 00:36:28,010
he used a specific example attacking a

1016
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:30,859
flag three times and you just all you

1017
00:36:30,859 --> 00:36:32,180
have to do is run away and you feel your

1018
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:34,940
health back to 100% when you're hiding

1019
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:37,460
and then you you know self heal but that

1020
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:38,630
won't be that way anymore

1021
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:42,260
you're gonna go and attack a flag this

1022
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:44,329
is your third flag you're attacking but

1023
00:36:44,329 --> 00:36:45,619
now you're gonna have to root you're

1024
00:36:45,619 --> 00:36:47,119
only gonna be able to self heal to a

1025
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:49,700
certain extent your your ammo may be low

1026
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,200
and if you're not picking them up

1027
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,089
consciously picking up ammo though you

1028
00:36:53,089 --> 00:36:55,760
should then maybe you won't push the

1029
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,859
attack you have to go back and resupply

1030
00:36:57,859 --> 00:36:59,930
or have your squad supports you and I

1031
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:01,849
like that that that's gonna kind of

1032
00:37:01,849 --> 00:37:03,619
change a little bit somebody brought up

1033
00:37:03,619 --> 00:37:05,930
what if what about X enemies dropping

1034
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:07,430
health packs and stuff so they're like

1035
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:08,599
oh that's interesting we're still

1036
00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:10,520
tweaking well we'll look to see that but

1037
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,230
how that affects this this whole new

1038
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,859
scarcity thing so I talked about the

1039
00:37:14,859 --> 00:37:19,190
fortifications and I talked about that

1040
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:22,069
new kill cam and bleeding out and what

1041
00:37:22,069 --> 00:37:24,619
operations are depicting historical

1042
00:37:24,619 --> 00:37:26,869
battles of World War two it's narrated

1043
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:29,150
as you go through it so it's split over

1044
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:30,890
for fictional days okay they're not

1045
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:32,539
calendar days it could be like this at

1046
00:37:32,539 --> 00:37:33,680
the beginning of the month or at the end

1047
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,970
of the month or not calendar days

1048
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:36,950
they're just for unique and distinct

1049
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:39,200
sort of gameplay modes with their own

1050
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,839
custom rules and map layouts and that's

1051
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:44,029
a grand operation now you're not always

1052
00:37:44,029 --> 00:37:45,740
gonna get that fourth one not people

1053
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:47,720
don't know that it's actually three so

1054
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:50,299
each day's final result from that first

1055
00:37:50,299 --> 00:37:51,799
one will impact the start of the

1056
00:37:51,799 --> 00:37:54,289
following day we had limiting your

1057
00:37:54,289 --> 00:37:56,119
initial respawns or the types of

1058
00:37:56,119 --> 00:37:57,710
resources available the types of

1059
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:59,630
vehicles available so that sounded

1060
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:02,569
really cool but the fourth day is only a

1061
00:38:02,569 --> 00:38:04,760
final stand is what they called it and

1062
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:08,029
you only play that if day three ends in

1063
00:38:08,029 --> 00:38:10,220
a draw they were targeting this to occur

1064
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:11,990
approximately a third of the time so

1065
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:13,520
you're not gonna actually see this every

1066
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,440
time it's gonna be something special

1067
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,390
and I thought that was kind of cool and

1068
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:19,579
what is that final stand it sounded so

1069
00:38:19,579 --> 00:38:22,069
exciting like there's the ammo is super

1070
00:38:22,069 --> 00:38:24,380
scarce you know you've got your that

1071
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:25,789
actually gives a little more precedence

1072
00:38:25,789 --> 00:38:27,740
to melee weapons and and like you know

1073
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:30,710
it's at moment and in court what is it

1074
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:32,630
Saving Private Ryan we take someone out

1075
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:34,740
these throws and he runs out of ammo

1076
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:37,930
throws it that's the kind of stuff you

1077
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:39,819
just do be at each other's throat and

1078
00:38:39,819 --> 00:38:42,280
and it talks about a moment where it was

1079
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,079
like 64 players I'll talk about that in

1080
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:46,119
a second and then this final Stan had

1081
00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:48,270
got down to like four versus one and

1082
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:50,410
everybody in the operation that's

1083
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:52,060
participated in the operation was

1084
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:54,640
watching this one guy you know trying to

1085
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,470
take out these four guys and he did it

1086
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:59,440
and it was such an amazing moment a

1087
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,089
moment that people were talking about in

1088
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:02,619
the office and I could see that kind of

1089
00:39:02,619 --> 00:39:04,599
stuff happening and I want to be that

1090
00:39:04,599 --> 00:39:08,500
one person and so all you Steve see the

1091
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,390
evolution of the game here versus

1092
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:12,160
something like battle royale it's crazy

1093
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,710
to me this year's battle field up

1094
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:16,420
against Call of Duty I've never seen

1095
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:19,240
this kind of disparity and in in hype

1096
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,940
and evolution in excitement between

1097
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:26,980
these two at least in my opinion it's

1098
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:28,630
gonna be the best game mode it's gonna

1099
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:30,190
have the most replayability that's what

1100
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:32,020
I'm thinking that's the note I took from

1101
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:35,740
my personal self then they talked about

1102
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,450
they could do grant operations how

1103
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:39,730
paratroopers affect that you know every

1104
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:42,099
time you spawn in airborne you're gonna

1105
00:39:42,099 --> 00:39:43,390
be in an airplane and you're gonna

1106
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:45,310
decide when you want to jump out of the

1107
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:46,869
airplane and spawn if you're in the

1108
00:39:46,869 --> 00:39:49,329
airborne that's gonna be so cool

1109
00:39:49,329 --> 00:39:51,849
and then this operation example you had

1110
00:39:51,849 --> 00:39:53,800
to take out artillery pieces at first

1111
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,200
then day - how many artillery pieces did

1112
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,720
you take out in day one that side oh if

1113
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,010
we did poorly then we're gonna have

1114
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:01,960
fewer take fewer tickets to spawn

1115
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:04,180
soldiers and we'll have fewer vehicles

1116
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:06,670
in the next phase which is like a tank

1117
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:08,980
battle or something and then the next

1118
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:12,970
day let's see day three one example no

1119
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:14,710
this is what when he was talking about

1120
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:16,780
that at that moment one life only no

1121
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:19,660
respawns only one mag in your gun a

1122
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:23,200
fight to the last man medics can revive

1123
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,150
and maintain that makes medics even more

1124
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:28,359
important they can mine revive people

1125
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:29,890
your buddies can still revive you -

1126
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:31,089
remember you have that buddy healing

1127
00:40:31,089 --> 00:40:33,790
system but squad what what that does is

1128
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:35,500
it makes squad wipes so much more

1129
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,050
important and you know that they won't

1130
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:39,430
be back you'll get that it's not just

1131
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:40,960
bonus points it's like boom you did a

1132
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,740
squad wipe

1133
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:43,960
you're a fucking badass they're not

1134
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,400
coming back

1135
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,829
you got extreme weather storms for final

1136
00:40:47,829 --> 00:40:48,460
stand the

1137
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:51,550
tensity that entire 64-player ranch is

1138
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:53,589
watching those survivors dynamic goes

1139
00:40:53,589 --> 00:40:54,609
weather is back

1140
00:40:54,609 --> 00:40:57,010
no operation mode needed for that it's

1141
00:40:57,010 --> 00:41:02,380
everywhere yeah RBD so talking about

1142
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:04,390
that gun the recoil stuff again they did

1143
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:06,369
a whole section on that there it's a

1144
00:41:06,369 --> 00:41:08,170
clear pattern for the first few bullets

1145
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:11,050
shot moving away from random elements

1146
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:13,420
you will shoot where you aim they kind

1147
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:14,830
of noted in in previous battlefield

1148
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:16,690
sometimes you shoot and the bullet just

1149
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:18,339
doesn't go where it's supposed to go and

1150
00:41:18,339 --> 00:41:20,650
and they want to make sure that they fix

1151
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:23,650
that and RB D is gone whatever RB d

1152
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:25,770
stands for I think it's random bullet

1153
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:30,369
displacement or something and then the

1154
00:41:30,369 --> 00:41:31,780
scarcity that we were talking about

1155
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,910
that's gonna balance more powerful

1156
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:35,560
weapons versus weaker weapons there's be

1157
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,540
more ammo for the weekers and less for

1158
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:40,660
the more powerful ones I already talked

1159
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:45,670
about LMGs and bipod and the functions

1160
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:48,160
for squad reinforcements you're built

1161
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,570
you're getting these points you could

1162
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:53,290
call in things I talked about shooting

1163
00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:54,849
wall sliding shoot on the way down from

1164
00:41:54,849 --> 00:41:57,730
buildings on that apex and down all

1165
00:41:57,730 --> 00:42:03,390
right where where are we on page 7 you

1166
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:05,980
cannot completely level a building I

1167
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:08,680
talked about that in a couple you could

1168
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,089
completely there's gonna be a couple

1169
00:42:10,089 --> 00:42:12,760
that you maybe can but here they just

1170
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,500
talked about how that sounded so awesome

1171
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,450
that you could level in an entire level

1172
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:18,550
but they chested it and you could just

1173
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:20,770
destroy the hell out of it but it wasn't

1174
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:22,690
fun by then so you're gonna be able to

1175
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:24,190
do it to some pieces but not every

1176
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:26,320
single piece so they have to have areas

1177
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,520
where they can build up those

1178
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,770
fortifications and build it back up so I

1179
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:31,300
like the fact that there's gonna be base

1180
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:34,930
skeletons in these important areas yeah

1181
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:38,140
so now I'm just going through some of

1182
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:40,390
the stuff archetypes

1183
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:41,820
is the thing that you're gonna be doing

1184
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:45,099
selecting an archetype recon paratrooper

1185
00:42:45,099 --> 00:42:47,200
what does that mean well the parent that

1186
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,240
guy will have high agility high health

1187
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,580
regen it's and I wrote it down high

1188
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:53,680
blast reductions but very low

1189
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,690
suppression sensitivity whatever that

1190
00:42:55,690 --> 00:42:56,109
means

1191
00:42:56,109 --> 00:42:58,839
I saw his little meters and that was for

1192
00:42:58,839 --> 00:43:01,330
the Recon paratrooper and there's going

1193
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:01,540
to be

1194
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:04,360
different different things different

1195
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,340
gadgets different special abilities that

1196
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:08,590
are unique to that guy I saw that

1197
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:10,960
something else unlocks at level 4 recon

1198
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,360
maybe his abilities and in different

1199
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,760
ways that he can run longer or you know

1200
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,690
stuff like that and then I saw gear and

1201
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:20,920
specialization vehicles they're gonna

1202
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:23,320
have branching multiple paths that you

1203
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,300
will see physically change on the tank

1204
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:27,280
if you go down this path and then this

1205
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,380
path does this path your tank will

1206
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:32,920
change different parts on it customizing

1207
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:36,280
it all in the world war to look 5 to 7

1208
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,110
different customization part parts

1209
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:40,030
unique things I wrote it down leaves

1210
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:42,760
sticks engravings colors tanks have camo

1211
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:45,430
mesh layers like sandbags branches boxes

1212
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:49,030
grass all stuff so assignments how are

1213
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:50,470
you gonna lock all this well there's

1214
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:52,060
different ways to earn the in-game

1215
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:53,890
currency not by what currency but

1216
00:43:53,890 --> 00:43:55,390
in-game currency I don't know maybe in

1217
00:43:55,390 --> 00:43:56,920
the future builder buy this currency but

1218
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:58,810
the in-game currency and that's all they

1219
00:43:58,810 --> 00:44:01,210
said is that daily orders so you get

1220
00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:03,100
three missions every day and I looked at

1221
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:05,320
it the reward was 1500 okay

1222
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,300
this is way too early because obvious

1223
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:08,710
this games not coming out to November

1224
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:11,140
but that's the number I saw that you get

1225
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:13,120
those daily orders and then there's also

1226
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,740
something called special assignments

1227
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:16,420
these are longer lasting ones it's gonna

1228
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:18,310
take a while to grind them out it looks

1229
00:44:18,310 --> 00:44:20,110
like you'll have four slot assignments

1230
00:44:20,110 --> 00:44:22,030
at a time for these special assignments

1231
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:23,560
so that determines how you want to play

1232
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:24,940
today do you want to get 10 kills with

1233
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:26,950
the tank do you want a dogfight do you

1234
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:28,180
want to do this you want to do something

1235
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:30,220
else and those rewards that you get is

1236
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:31,810
it gonna be 1,500 and all those are

1237
00:44:31,810 --> 00:44:34,090
daily orders it'll be based on the

1238
00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:35,530
difficulty of that assignment maybe

1239
00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:37,120
you'll get 5,000 or something like that

1240
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:39,280
and then you can spend that 5,000 on

1241
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,260
unlocking the weapon that you want you

1242
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:43,240
want the tommy gun then you and unlock

1243
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:46,870
the the Thompson I'm sorry and and you

1244
00:44:46,870 --> 00:44:48,850
know and get that right away so I

1245
00:44:48,850 --> 00:44:51,070
thought that that was cool so you deck

1246
00:44:51,070 --> 00:44:53,950
out your soldiers your vehicles and your

1247
00:44:53,950 --> 00:44:57,640
unlocks the way you want armory screen I

1248
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:00,100
saw featured across the top weapons

1249
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:03,610
vehicle soldiers boosts most what is

1250
00:45:03,610 --> 00:45:04,990
that I don't know that's been in

1251
00:45:04,990 --> 00:45:07,330
previous games right so flexibility to

1252
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:08,560
grab what you want what you want to

1253
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,130
focus on

1254
00:45:10,130 --> 00:45:13,460
and yeah going back to tides of war what

1255
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:15,259
do you get rewards I mentioned get

1256
00:45:15,259 --> 00:45:17,569
rewards you get new vehicles new weapons

1257
00:45:17,569 --> 00:45:19,309
taught their timed events you get dog

1258
00:45:19,309 --> 00:45:21,710
tag emblems face paint soldier skins

1259
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:24,170
weapon skins so many reasons to come

1260
00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:26,329
back and participating in that and then

1261
00:45:26,329 --> 00:45:27,710
you could say you were there at the

1262
00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:30,319
Battle of one of you had a whatever or

1263
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:34,729
at the stand of whatever right you know

1264
00:45:34,729 --> 00:45:37,460
somebody made a joke will be able to do

1265
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:39,049
the like a gold man you know the

1266
00:45:39,049 --> 00:45:41,299
Hollywood Boulevard gold man gold face

1267
00:45:41,299 --> 00:45:43,759
paint as a joke and I I don't think he

1268
00:45:43,759 --> 00:45:46,489
said no it's not not like that but maybe

1269
00:45:46,489 --> 00:45:48,829
I want it I want it I want Gold man face

1270
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:52,670
been all mine I saw with my own eyes I

1271
00:45:52,670 --> 00:45:54,259
saw and I wrote it down really quickly

1272
00:45:54,259 --> 00:45:58,190
tank winter body rare okay let me show

1273
00:45:58,190 --> 00:46:01,190
you this here rare so that's that's one

1274
00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:02,869
that I would have done this and then

1275
00:46:02,869 --> 00:46:06,710
winter grip common so this I think is

1276
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:08,739
where you're going to get your

1277
00:46:08,739 --> 00:46:11,690
microtransactions where it's going to be

1278
00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:15,999
you know you know let's see here

1279
00:46:15,999 --> 00:46:18,170
micro this is where I think you're gonna

1280
00:46:18,170 --> 00:46:21,759
get the microtransactions in the visual

1281
00:46:21,759 --> 00:46:24,680
customizations now is that okay is that

1282
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:27,019
okay for you if they if they do know

1283
00:46:27,019 --> 00:46:29,630
premium pass no loot box is tied to

1284
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:31,369
progression like fucking Star Wars

1285
00:46:31,369 --> 00:46:33,079
Battlefront two but just keep it to

1286
00:46:33,079 --> 00:46:34,759
visual customization is that okay with

1287
00:46:34,759 --> 00:46:37,249
you the answer for me is yes if they do

1288
00:46:37,249 --> 00:46:38,930
all of these things and make this a

1289
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:41,299
gaming a service and constantly add new

1290
00:46:41,299 --> 00:46:43,789
to the war to map and and provide us

1291
00:46:43,789 --> 00:46:45,529
with all this stuff and I'm having fun I

1292
00:46:45,529 --> 00:46:49,339
have no problem spending money on things

1293
00:46:49,339 --> 00:46:52,039
to make me look unique or our visual

1294
00:46:52,039 --> 00:46:54,170
customization are they gonna be exciting

1295
00:46:54,170 --> 00:46:56,479
enough to buy I don't know I don't know

1296
00:46:56,479 --> 00:46:57,799
that that's a question maybe they won't

1297
00:46:57,799 --> 00:46:59,660
make as much money on battlefield 5

1298
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:01,579
minute it will be a failure I hope not

1299
00:47:01,579 --> 00:47:04,009
for at least for the suits it's not

1300
00:47:04,009 --> 00:47:05,450
gonna be a failure cuz it's gonna sell

1301
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:08,660
at $60 a pop and maybe more so well not

1302
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:10,309
more that's another thing they didn't

1303
00:47:10,309 --> 00:47:12,440
have these wacky special editions they

1304
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:14,239
did have thing that pissed me off did

1305
00:47:14,239 --> 00:47:16,430
like the freaking EAA Act says well you

1306
00:47:16,430 --> 00:47:18,289
spent five dogs bucks a month you could

1307
00:47:18,289 --> 00:47:19,609
play it orally well if you're a hardcore

1308
00:47:19,609 --> 00:47:21,890
fan just get it and then cancel it

1309
00:47:21,890 --> 00:47:24,720
right but then one edition comes out a

1310
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,700
few days before they've done this as

1311
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:29,130
well before it's just annoying but

1312
00:47:29,130 --> 00:47:31,289
that's how they're doing it now at least

1313
00:47:31,289 --> 00:47:33,960
there's not forcing you into a 250

1314
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:35,970
dollar Edition or something or making

1315
00:47:35,970 --> 00:47:37,410
you feel like you have to buy that one

1316
00:47:37,410 --> 00:47:39,299
so there's a little bit of props to be

1317
00:47:39,299 --> 00:47:41,069
added for there even though some of this

1318
00:47:41,069 --> 00:47:42,690
stuff still so pisses me off

1319
00:47:42,690 --> 00:47:45,150
well Otto burr 11th was that play first

1320
00:47:45,150 --> 00:47:46,680
trial that's what they said

1321
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:49,260
deluxe edition is October 16th standard

1322
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:52,140
edition is October 19th and then they

1323
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:53,190
said they're just gonna give away free

1324
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:55,589
stuff so they said battlefield 4 final

1325
00:47:55,589 --> 00:47:56,730
Stan we're gonna give that away

1326
00:47:56,730 --> 00:47:58,200
battlefield 1 in the name of the Czar

1327
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:00,420
that that's free now for anybody that

1328
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:02,039
hasn't jumped into those games they said

1329
00:48:02,039 --> 00:48:04,020
it's a way to hold you over until we get

1330
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:06,450
to those things so that was nice we

1331
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:07,890
tried to ask about the better date it's

1332
00:48:07,890 --> 00:48:09,089
unknown they didn't talk about it

1333
00:48:09,089 --> 00:48:10,380
they're probably gonna save that for ei

1334
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:12,990
plays or Eid you know III and announce

1335
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:14,640
when the beta comes out maybe around

1336
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,190
then I'm hoping so I cannot wait to get

1337
00:48:17,190 --> 00:48:19,579
my hands on this game because I think

1338
00:48:19,579 --> 00:48:22,650
from all the different things that I saw

1339
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:24,089
these guys get it

1340
00:48:24,089 --> 00:48:27,180
what makes war feel and play like a war

1341
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:29,549
that's what they're evolving that's what

1342
00:48:29,549 --> 00:48:32,099
they're focusing on okay it makes Call

1343
00:48:32,099 --> 00:48:34,859
of Duty look as the new animations make

1344
00:48:34,859 --> 00:48:37,140
them look as stiff as a fucking to

1345
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:40,470
pecker billy goat okay it's tupid as a

1346
00:48:40,470 --> 00:48:42,420
stiff just stiff as a board

1347
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:43,980
okay this Call of Duty is gonna look

1348
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:45,960
ridiculous up against this game with

1349
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:48,119
this new animation system that I saw it

1350
00:48:48,119 --> 00:48:49,349
was amazing

1351
00:48:49,349 --> 00:48:51,690
you know battlefield I wrote here is

1352
00:48:51,690 --> 00:48:53,430
taking its inspiration from games like

1353
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:56,430
squad whereas Call of Duty is taking

1354
00:48:56,430 --> 00:48:58,980
from games like fortnight which do you

1355
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:00,450
think will be a better war game

1356
00:49:00,450 --> 00:49:02,700
simulation which is which is gonna feel

1357
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:06,900
like that battle more I'm being honest

1358
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:08,849
with you guys have never felt like

1359
00:49:08,849 --> 00:49:11,430
there's been a bigger disparity between

1360
00:49:11,430 --> 00:49:13,380
the battlefield and the Call of Duty

1361
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:16,920
games in a single year and and honestly

1362
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:19,380
if any battlefield deserves to outsell

1363
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:22,260
and outshine Call of Duty and pure

1364
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:25,079
numbers and revenue in my opinion it's

1365
00:49:25,079 --> 00:49:28,170
this one unless there's some sort of

1366
00:49:28,170 --> 00:49:32,010
catch that I haven't seen this I want

1367
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:34,799
battlefield 5 to go over on call of duty

1368
00:49:34,799 --> 00:49:35,560
black

1369
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:39,330
for and for everything that I saw and

1370
00:49:39,330 --> 00:49:45,160
yeah I I'm happy that I just want them

1371
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:47,500
to put that three hour presentation out

1372
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:49,060
there but I pretty much covered almost

1373
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:51,430
everything that was in there so anything

1374
00:49:51,430 --> 00:49:53,230
beyond what I guys told you thank you

1375
00:49:53,230 --> 00:49:55,390
for sticking it out in this long boring

1376
00:49:55,390 --> 00:49:57,160
video that I wasn't I'm not allowed to

1377
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:59,740
show you the visuals I don't want to get

1378
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:02,140
copyright strikes on certain specific

1379
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:04,390
slides that I could have showed you and

1380
00:50:04,390 --> 00:50:06,340
those little video animations it would

1381
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:08,560
have been amazing and got you excited in

1382
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:11,860
the modes and things so sorry for that

1383
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:15,670
but this is a huge info dump that I felt

1384
00:50:15,670 --> 00:50:17,650
was missing from the battlefield 5

1385
00:50:17,650 --> 00:50:20,650
reveal that really you know kind of blew

1386
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:22,120
me away and then when they did the

1387
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:22,780
Trevor Noah

1388
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:25,030
and reviewers I don't know if that came

1389
00:50:25,030 --> 00:50:27,550
across did did people see that as a as a

1390
00:50:27,550 --> 00:50:30,460
win I saw it's kind of getting a lot of

1391
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:32,830
down votes not a whole bunch but maybe

1392
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:34,360
that's just the Call of Duty guys pissed

1393
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:37,060
off you know I don't know what it is but

1394
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:40,720
I saw I was super excited for it I can't

1395
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:43,510
wait for battlefield 5 in the return to

1396
00:50:43,510 --> 00:50:45,130
world war 2 because I feel that's kind

1397
00:50:45,130 --> 00:50:48,400
of where the game really started and

1398
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:49,840
where it feels the best and that

1399
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:53,020
combined-arms kind of thing not the mode

1400
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:54,730
but the you know the tanks and the

1401
00:50:54,730 --> 00:50:56,980
squads and the aircraft and all this

1402
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:59,500
stuff and it's not bad a way out where

1403
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:00,640
you die Oh

1404
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:03,550
battle area we have a sea land and air

1405
00:51:03,550 --> 00:51:05,440
and then you die in is over and you sit

1406
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:07,150
there and watch everything for 20

1407
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:08,950
minutes know you're in the battle and

1408
00:51:08,950 --> 00:51:11,050
you're making decisions constantly that

1409
00:51:11,050 --> 00:51:12,940
intensity is there and it feels like a

1410
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:14,890
war especially in grant operations

1411
00:51:14,890 --> 00:51:17,830
