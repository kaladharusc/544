2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:02,760
little bit of Far Cry primal here

3
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,470
decided to get back to my roots you know

4
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,720
as a human as a member of the human race

5
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,940
we all came from the same pile of

6
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,889
dinosaur shit guys okay let's not fool

7
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:14,910

12
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,350
yeah that's new actually that stands for

13
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,720
before Common Era my day was good old

14
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,910
before Christ come on that was a way

15
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,529
better method of measurement what was

16
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:33,270
before him we certainly didn't have the

17
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:34,800
Thomas the Tank Engine Shoah tell you

18
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,730
that much and here we see the origins of

19
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:40,680
humankind's time weathered phrase row

20
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,800
