1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:05,839
[Laughter]

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,470
seventy-five dollars

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:10,740
don't stick with my Hulu seven eight

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:26,300
dollars a month to watch this pieces I

5
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,189
want you to know that everything you are

6
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:32,040
doing is bad everything you're doing

7
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:37,260
here is bad okay oh my god

8
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,629
Teen Titans we have to talk about this

9
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:41,969
again we already did the trailer

10
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:45,809
reaction for because is in terrible but

11
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:48,600
I never got to mention you know and

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,969
really harp on the fact that all the

13
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:53,430
effects suck they're using stock sound

14
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,620
effects from action essentials too by

15
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,930
the way which I use to write it's like a

16
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:01,530
100 dollar program and they're using the

17
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,790
same budget and and one scene that I

18
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,860
notice after we put up our trailer we

19
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,540
have to talk about and then we'll get to

20
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,580
the brand-new news which is the Batman

21
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,610
reveal right but so I have to show you

22
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,290
this one scene here if we go frame by

23
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:19,860
frame we have dog here who if you don't

24
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,420
know none of this makes sense because

25
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,790
she's peaceful she hates violence she

26
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:26,030
aids you know you know they got this

27
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:28,619
storyline for her and over here she

28
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:30,270
shouldn't be able killing people

29
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:33,060
basically but here's the craziest part

30
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:44,640
she has the power most pathetic shit I

31
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,930
have ever seen how what is she doing

32
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:51,780
that's a hard-ass laughing this this

33
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,840
effect guys I'm serious I could do this

34
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,750
effect in fact I'm gonna play my effect

35
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,960
alongside this effect ready whose effect

36
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:07,819
was better my this is so bad like I okay

37
00:02:07,819 --> 00:02:13,410
guys this is going to be

38
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:17,320
hilarious disaster and even more

39
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:21,130
evidence for that is this where do we

40
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:25,630
get a first look of Batman you're

41
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:30,300
fucking with me right here is Batman Joe

42
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:36,160
why that's bad suit why look at our team

43
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,030
it's stupid it is what okay it's meant

44
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:42,459
to be seen in the dark and shadows right

45
00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:45,070
as what they say it's Phyllis Phil or

46
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:47,950
this but they don't even have the budget

47
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:52,270
or or respect you know Batman is I give

48
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:53,800
Batman alone shit but they don't even

49
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:58,030
have the respect to do an actual real

50
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:00,610
badass looking costume even if he's in

51
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:02,800
the shadows you could get a cosplayer to

52
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,800
help you if you guys need help you they

53
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,500
clearly need help Joe they need help

54
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,180
like I get you trying to do something

55
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:13,900
different but this is just bad oh yes

56
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,510
Teen Titan anti tango I like them both

57
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:21,580
but this there's no words for this it

58
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:25,980
shouldn't exist okay so the idea is that

59
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,380
you're gonna get the app and it is the

60
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,150
the reason that you would watch

61
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:34,930
something as terrible as this is do they

62
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:52,299
pay you does the app pay you all right

63
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:53,950
so it's for this right here it was

64
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:57,700
switch over to my iPad and you can

65
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,620
actually get the app right now notice

66
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,720
it's three stars it's nowhere near as as

67
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,840
down voted as the this trailer here but

68
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,989
it probably will win yeah the it's not

69
00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:09,940
officially out but it got sort of

70
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,590
stopped released here this is the DC

71
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:15,400
Universe app and so Titan show is the

72
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,500
one that's supposed to drive you to go

73
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,380
and buy it right the exclusive original

74
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,870
series right so it's I don't know how

75
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:25,240
much it is a month well let we can find

76
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,430
out here but enjoy unlimited

77
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,979
access to DC shows that you can't see

78
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:31,960
anywhere else you can't see this shit

79
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,130
anywhere else right including Titans

80
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:39,419
Doom Patrol swampthing and Young Justice

81
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:43,750
outsiders so one to the so there's three

82
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,500
other shows besides Titans and maybe

83
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,870
that's why Titans itself looks so

84
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:52,270
terrible so low-budget because they're

85
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,490
splitting it they're spreading their

86
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:59,530
what $70,000 but amongst four different

87
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:01,720
shows for this shitty app now that

88
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,270
sounds exciting I'm gonna admit you know

89
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:08,830
let me there's their budget now I'm

90
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,860
gonna admit that you know Doom Patrol

91
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,449
swampthing and Young Justice Outsiders

92
00:05:13,449 --> 00:05:15,039
that actually kind of sounds exciting

93
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,650
but for here's a small thing for you

94
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,650
guys to get Titans so fundamentally

95
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:23,410
wrong it makes me really worried about

96
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:25,930
all these oh yeah and that's supposed to

97
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:28,360
be the hard hitter okay and then you get

98
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,639
your comics from Action Comics 1 2

99
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,220
rebored these universe add to your

100
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,900
digital long box of course you got to

101
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,220
rebuy the comments it's not like all the

102
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:38,159
comics are free there's probably a few

103
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:40,840
Members Only merchandise you get to buy

104
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,479
stuff that nobody else gets to buy I was

105
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:45,130
about to say fuck off but then I saw the

106
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:50,080
Superman action figure and I said oh and

107
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,479
then connect with the DC community so

108
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,280
that we can all complain about how

109
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,759
shitty this is boys who literally are

110
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,460
blind will love anything and I don't

111
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,470
even see how DC fanboys could defend the

112
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,750
Titans show so you start your free trial

113
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:14,020
let's see how much they want for it $75

114
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:18,070
don't stick with my Hulu 7 8 dollars a

115
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:21,729
month to watch this piece of shit I hate

116
00:06:21,729 --> 00:06:26,830
oh yeah you know it you know it's worth

117
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:33,110
it so what not

118
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:39,800
oh my god is gonna be putting now now a

119
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:47,139

for you Joe as for little teen girls

121
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:56,770

they put the bubble effect Oh guys so

123
00:06:59,629 --> 00:07:01,909
bad is so bad and what do they want for

124
00:07:01,909 --> 00:07:04,729
that they want there you go

125
00:07:04,729 --> 00:07:07,639
give us this like I like Beast Boy I

126
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:08,750
wonder what they're gonna do is they're

127
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,520
gonna spray paint like everything like

128
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,250
every animal green oh you saw bees yeah

129
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,930
I know they don't have to budget for

130
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:19,099
Beast Boy Joe heroin he doesn't look

131
00:07:19,099 --> 00:07:21,949
good what he can do with the animals

132
00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:24,710
if the CGI is horrible he died we need

133
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:25,340
your help

134
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:56,710
shut this show down it's not my fur coat

135
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:59,900
stripper wearing you know kind of on the

136
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,039
sides we hey honey

137
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:11,900
you want a good time she's all about

138
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:20,330
flames so that I think I find this stuff

139
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:22,279
really hilarious and so that's what

140
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:24,740
they're asking for you now eight dollars

141
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:27,560
a month is wait she wants to ask for

142
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,169
this but it's a slap it is a input you

143
00:08:30,169 --> 00:08:33,159
get right this and the three other shows

144
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:36,560
your comic books know like winter those

145
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,409
shows coming out I had maybe when those

146
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:41,510
shows come out and there's all four of

147
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,610
them and there's maybe all of those are

148
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:44,550
really really good

149
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:47,279
let's just say all Doom Patrol Young

150
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,200
Justice and Swamp Thing are all really

151
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,589
good shows and Titans is awful even that

152
00:08:52,589 --> 00:08:55,620
is a lot to ask for Joe because Netflix

153
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,690
are constantly coming out with Dario to

154
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:01,790
Luke Cage all these other ones

155
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:04,680
so oh and you know you won't get to read

156
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,750
a few comics that they feel sorry for

157
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,600
they'll put in the garbage you shows

158
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,589
three that you buy no man I don't know

159
00:09:13,589 --> 00:09:16,500
we'll keep an eye on this and if you

160
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,050
guys want us to review Titans and just

161
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:21,570
so that you don't have to and watch it

162
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:25,110
let us know in the comments so that's as

163
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:28,470
one good thing from DC the joaquin

164
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:32,399
phoenix thing and you know let me go

165
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,620
over here and and then one bad thing

166
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:38,040
from DC you know so it's a take we never

167
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,060
thought was gonna happen

168
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,730
III believe in his performance as an

169
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:44,279
actor however what's the material he's

170
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:46,140
gonna get who you know what about the

171
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,610
director how they gonna prove you know

172
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:49,730
I'm still nervous about all that stuff

173
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:52,550
clearly there's some people in charge

174
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,600
DC somewhere they don't know what

175
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,440
they're doing so hopefully they stay far

176
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,290
away from the Joker project and the

177
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:03,779
Joker project hopefully inspires the

178
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:06,209
rest of this stuff and we might see more

179
00:10:06,209 --> 00:10:08,459
Elseworlds films I'd love to see a

180
00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:11,160
Superman red Sun that would never happen

181
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,149
that's Soviet and then and then all

182
00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:18,690
patriotic Americans really good bullshit

183
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:20,940
but it's an interesting story maybe you

184
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,440
could do all-star Superman something

185
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,750
like that but anyway tell us guys what

186
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,570
you think of the the Batman and the

187
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:39,750
Titans and the Joker alright so bad

188
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:50,290
