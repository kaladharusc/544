1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,589
every once in a while the topic comes up

2
00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:03,360
in the news that I feel like I need to

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,040
talk about and even though I try to stay

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,379
away from drama in politics about once a

5
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:08,849
month I do this to myself and I get

6
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:09,990
horribly depressed because of the

7
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:11,610
backlash and I know there's gonna be a

8
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:13,200
backlash about this um but every once in

9
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,730
a while it's so important to me I have

10
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:16,770
to talk about it so I'm going to talk

11
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:18,029
about this one and you can get really

12
00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:19,410
mad at me and I'll just deal with it and

13
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:20,820
fair warning for those of you who don't

14
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,470
like my fence sitting I'm going to

15
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,300
straddle the fence really hard on this

16
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,189
topic and show both sides of the fence

17
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:27,330
but I promise you by the end of the

18
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,550
video I'm gonna hop off to one side and

19
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:30,750
then probably the other for a little bit

20
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,189
because this is a nuanced thing and I

21
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:33,870
have a nuanced position on this so if

22
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:34,739
you've seen the guardians of the

23
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:36,960
galaxy's movies 1 &amp; 2 they were directed

24
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,489
by a director by the name of James Gunn

25
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:40,680
and he was on board to direct the third

26
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,239
movie at least that's what he tweeted

27
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:43,469
and said that he would be doing the

28
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:45,480
third movie and as of today right in the

29
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,000
middle of San Diego comic-con they fired

30
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,579
him from the third movie he will not be

31
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:51,780
doing the next Guardi of the galaxies

32
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:52,860
and I he probably won't be doing

33
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,539
anything with Disney moving forward and

34
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:56,640
as firing stems from some tweets that

35
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,350
have surfaced have been making the

36
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,239
rounds recently about some of the most

37
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,129
just disgusting stuff I've ever heard I

38
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:04,229
mean I would show you the tweets here

39
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:05,850
but they are so offensive that this

40
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,170
video could get flagged

41
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,210
I would I would link to them down below

42
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:10,409
but I think you should find them on your

43
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:11,820
own term oh wait we were talking about

44
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,610
some really really disgusting stuff

45
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,680
it was meant as jokes it was clearly

46
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,630
jokes is clearly not something I hoped

47
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:19,979
that he would ever participate in or

48
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:21,659
really anybody would ever participate in

49
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:23,970
but it was some really really disgusting

50
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:26,040
stuff and he tweeted that stuff not

51
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,170
recently not in the last few years not

52
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,000
since he got hired by Disney he tweeted

53
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,340
it about ten or eleven years ago now if

54
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,509
I can hop off the fence here for a

55
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:35,700
second I want to say I grew up loving

56
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,040
dark humor shock humor I listened to

57
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,250
Lisa Lampanelli in the 2000s Richard

58
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,310
Pryor George Carlin Sam Kinison some

59
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,630
Indra Dice Clay some of the most

60
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,149
offensive comedians you can imagine I

61
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:50,130
love that type of humor sometimes I tell

62
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,810
jokes like that in real life you can

63
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:53,729
even find compilations where I said

64
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:56,399
stupid jokes very very dark disgusting

65
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,770
jokes on Twitch as well as its my sense

66
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:01,350
of humor and even then with what the

67
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,149
stuff he was tweeting I did not find it

68
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:05,490
to be funny in or out of the context

69
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,649
it just seems shocking for shocking sake

70
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:09,780
but that kind of makes sense with the

71
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,420
position that James Gunn was in in his

72
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,770
life when he was making those two

73
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,330
eleven years ago and the reason I say

74
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,280
that is if you look at James Gunn's

75
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,900
director or your history if you look at

76
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,340
his Twitter history you look at anything

77
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,230
he's ever done you know that he worked

78
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:24,870
for Troma films he directed Romeo and

79
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:27,480
Juliet animated dark comedy called super

80
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,850
he he does some dark stuff some weird

81
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:32,190
stuff some creepy stuff these tweets are

82
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,870
much darker and much creepier than

83
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,040
anything that you would find in its

84
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,080
mainstream stuff but clearly he has a

85
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,030
history of embracing and enjoying dark

86
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:42,720
humor 10 15 20 years ago 1996 is when he

87
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,060
did Romeo and Juliet working with Troma

88
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,560
films and if you're familiar Troma films

89
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,390
you'll know that is some of the lowest

90
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:51,000
grade the common denominator offensive

91
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,800
stuff out there it's it's built just

92
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,840
purely to be offensive and entertaining

93
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,640
through its offensiveness and here's the

94
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,030
thing

95
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,650
Disney has the right to fire whoever

96
00:02:58,650 --> 00:02:59,940
they want they can work with whoever

97
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,160
they want but they knew about those

98
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,560
tweets they hurried James Gunn several

99
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,900
years after he made those tweets to

100
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,480
create guardians of the galaxy 1 &amp; 2

101
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,700
certainly they vetted him Disney vets

102
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,560
everybody they vet the people who stand

103
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,290
around in costumes at Disneyland so they

104
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,540
knew those tweets existed and they were

105
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,880
ok with it when they hired James Gunn

106
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,220
and let him make two blockbuster films

107
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,530
they were absolutely aware and the

108
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:26,940
reason we know that they had to be aware

109
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,080
the reason I believe it beyond the

110
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,340
shadow of a doubt and I will not listen

111
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,320
to an argument otherwise is because just

112
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,850
before he got announced as the director

113
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,650
for guardians of the galaxy he actually

114
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,870
addressed all of those old tweets he

115
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,430
actually apologized for them

116
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,590
he explained that that was his old sense

117
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,480
of humor that he'd outgrown it he no

118
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,130
longer thinks that way no longer does

119
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,780
that thing he put those things into

120
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,150
context and Disney was ok with that and

121
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,860
the world seemed to be ok with it and

122
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,360
then a few months later they announced

123
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,270
them for guardians of the galaxy one

124
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:55,620
clearly clearly that was part of the

125
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,180
vetting process and if you're curious as

126
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,310
to why these tweets are now resurfacing

127
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,860
according to Fox News they were posted

128
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,480
and started circulating again because

129
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,370
James Gunn is an outspoken critic of

130
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,200
President Donald Trump and the effort

131
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,690
was done as an effort to knock him down

132
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:11,850
a few pegs and they actually toppled the

133
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,560
guy entirely and here's where I hop off

134
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,060
the fence a little bit and really offend

135
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,350
some people and I'm sorry for those who

136
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:17,970
were going to take offense at this but I

137
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,730
do believe what I'm about to say this is

138
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:23,190
the flip side of the me2 movement which

139
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,930
is relatively been a very very good

140
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,030
movement exposing some very very

141
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:29,490
bad people but occasionally people you

142
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:31,590
trust people you like people you have

143
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:33,960
forgiven they're going to get this done

144
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,480
to them occasionally to this is this is

145
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,880
part of outraged culture this is part of

146
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,500
social progression this is part of the

147
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,660
movement once you put those weapons into

148
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,580
place once you put those tools into

149
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,770
place occasionally people you like and

150
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:48,870
people you care about are going to get

151
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:51,270
battered to death by those tools as well

152
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:53,430
it's probably worth it to take people

153
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,870
like Harvey Weinstein out though in my

154
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:57,360
opinion but your mileage may vary on

155
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,580
that and you know me I follow all kinds

156
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,500
of people on social media people on the

157
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,030
very far left people on the very far

158
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:05,400
right I like to have my opinions of my

159
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,660
ideas challenge it was something like

160
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,669
this happens I like to hear a wide

161
00:05:08,669 --> 00:05:10,140
variety of opinions because it helps me

162
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,000
form my own opinions so that I can share

163
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,700
them with you but the one thing I'm most

164
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,800
confused about is a lot of people in the

165
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,350
far left seem to be upset about this or

166
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:20,340
confused by this

167
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,320
they don't understand why this could

168
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,270
happen to James Gunn or how it's

169
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:27,060
happening to James but this is the world

170
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,340
we've built this is the world we've

171
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:33,030
created we fully weaponized social media

172
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,820
we have fully weaponized outrage culture

173
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,860
and and of course this is going to

174
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,110
happen from time to time of course the

175
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,180
same weapon that can kill a Donald Trump

176
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,250
supporter can kill a Hillary Clinton

177
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,350
supporter a weapon is a weapon is a

178
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,240
weapon I believe it would be very

179
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,710
hypocritical of me right here to like

180
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:51,300
lay in the James gun for those tweets

181
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,460
because even in just the last six months

182
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,930
if you look at some of my stream

183
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:57,450
archives I have said and done some

184
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:59,160
really dark stuff some really offensive

185
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,140
stuff I've made a bunch of mistakes and

186
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,580
that's just in the last six months if

187
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,979
you look at my life long history 10 12

188
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:06,960
15 years ago some of the stuff I've done

189
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,729
I'm gonna carry with me in the back of

190
00:06:08,729 --> 00:06:10,020
my mind I'm gonna carry the guilt of

191
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,720
that with me to my grave if I live to be

192
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,850
a hundred I'm gonna be miserable and I'm

193
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:16,680
gonna regret that stuff and I want to be

194
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,960
forgiving of just about anybody I can my

195
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,510
own family my friends myself included

196
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,860
and of course James Gunn it's hard to

197
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,750
keep me from celebrating the the two

198
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,800
wonderful movies that he made in

199
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,570
guardians galaxy one and two the next

200
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:29,100
move he makes I will probably watch it

201
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,080
I've never seen super but I might end up

202
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,280
reading that tonight just because I've

203
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,289
never seen it and I love Rainn Wilson so

204
00:06:34,289 --> 00:06:35,909
I didn't know that movie existed but I

205
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:37,979
will probably go watch it now and it's

206
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:39,479
not going to bother me that James Gunn

207
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:40,969
is not a great person

208
00:06:40,969 --> 00:06:42,799
because I try to separate the art from

209
00:06:42,799 --> 00:06:44,360
the artists I try to separate the good

210
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,099
from the bad when it comes to people I

211
00:06:46,099 --> 00:06:48,110
probably do that to a fault I'm fairly

212
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,849
certain I do that to a fault but at

213
00:06:49,849 --> 00:06:52,639
least I am consistent with my weak

214
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,219
willed fence sitting behavior at least I

215
00:06:55,219 --> 00:06:57,289
am I'm always like this it doesn't

216
00:06:57,289 --> 00:06:58,729
matter who you are it doesn't matter

217
00:06:58,729 --> 00:07:01,219
what you've done there are very very few

218
00:07:01,219 --> 00:07:02,659
people that have crossed my line I can

219
00:07:02,659 --> 00:07:04,189
count them on one hand which is good

220
00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:05,839
because my other weather arm is still

221
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:07,189
broken so it's kind of hard to use this

222
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:09,259
hand but I've always believed that the

223
00:07:09,259 --> 00:07:11,749
worst of us can be redeemed that the

224
00:07:11,749 --> 00:07:13,459
worst of us should be given a chance to

225
00:07:13,459 --> 00:07:15,139
be forgiven and to make up for the

226
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:17,209
damage that they have done so it's very

227
00:07:17,209 --> 00:07:20,209
very easy for me for to forgive James

228
00:07:20,209 --> 00:07:21,739
Gunn because he's got a track record of

229
00:07:21,739 --> 00:07:24,469
a decade of doing better and even when

230
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:26,089
he was making those tweets it wasn't a

231
00:07:26,089 --> 00:07:27,589
particularly bad person he was still

232
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:29,449
doing a lot of good things and I'll

233
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,309
quote Doctor Who here from an episode

234
00:07:31,309 --> 00:07:33,709
about Van Gogh in which he says that

235
00:07:33,709 --> 00:07:35,839
life is a pile of good things and a pile

236
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:37,819
of bad things in the the pile of good

237
00:07:37,819 --> 00:07:39,589
things do not necessarily wipe away the

238
00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:41,839
bad but the bad things don't necessarily

239
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:44,179
negate the good and every person's like

240
00:07:44,179 --> 00:07:45,800
that every person is a pile of good

241
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,479
things and bad things and when I look at

242
00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:49,039
James Gunn I see somebody who's done a

243
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,349
lot more good than bad even though those

244
00:07:51,349 --> 00:07:53,919
tweets are really hard to reconcile I

245
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,089
don't know where that stuff came from

246
00:07:56,089 --> 00:07:58,369
pretty crazy stuff but you have to

247
00:07:58,369 --> 00:08:00,019
realize that this is the world we've

248
00:08:00,019 --> 00:08:01,279
created if you're gonna play pure

249
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,800
hardball with people on the left people

250
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,419
are gonna play pure hardball with people

251
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:07,489
on the right and vice versa this is how

252
00:08:07,489 --> 00:08:08,749
the system works

253
00:08:08,749 --> 00:08:11,479
anger baguettes anger outrage begets

254
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:13,549
outrage this is the world we live in now

255
00:08:13,549 --> 00:08:15,349
this is the world we've created and now

256
00:08:15,349 --> 00:08:17,179
we have to lie in this bed because this

257
00:08:17,179 --> 00:08:19,129
is the bed we made and as someone was

258
00:08:19,129 --> 00:08:20,749
plenty of skeletons in his closet

259
00:08:20,749 --> 00:08:23,149
obviously I prefer my way of doing

260
00:08:23,149 --> 00:08:25,549
things I prefer forgiveness I prefer

261
00:08:25,549 --> 00:08:27,860
acceptance I prefer letting things go I

262
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,449
prefer all of that stuff

263
00:08:29,449 --> 00:08:31,759
I prefer giving a chance to people to do

264
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,409
better and to fix the things they

265
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:35,149
screwed up and an opportunity to put

266
00:08:35,149 --> 00:08:36,529
good into the world so they can add to

267
00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:38,509
the pile of good to try to make up for

268
00:08:38,509 --> 00:08:40,279
some of the things in the pile of bad

269
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:42,110
that's who I'm always willing to be

270
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:44,600
that's the way I wish the world was but

271
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,040
it certainly isn't that way anymore no

272
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,389
matter how much I begged over the last

273
00:08:47,389 --> 00:08:49,429
decade on this YouTube channel to try to

274
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:51,410
encourage people to be that way so as

275
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:52,790
usual I'm really curious as to what you

276
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,559
guys think what do you think about James

277
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:55,220
Gunn's tweets

278
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,389
do you think it's forgivable because

279
00:08:56,389 --> 00:08:58,129
it's so far in the past or do you think

280
00:08:58,129 --> 00:09:00,110
it's unforgivable now do you think he

281
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:01,519
made up for the damage that he may have

282
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:02,959
done or do you think he didn't do any

283
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,209
damage do you think shock humor is OK do

284
00:09:05,209 --> 00:09:06,470
you think it was okay then and it's not

285
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:08,389
okay now that the world has changed do

286
00:09:08,389 --> 00:09:09,920
you like the world we've created I'm

287
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,360
really looking forward to discussion

288
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,560
about this in the comments section below

289
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,329
and it's gonna be tough to read because

290
00:09:14,329 --> 00:09:15,740
I know people are gonna be very very

291
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:18,439
critical of me there um as you probably

292
00:09:18,439 --> 00:09:20,269
should be I definitely have skeletons in

293
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:21,560
my closet I've definitely made a lot of

294
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,870
mistakes and eventually it'll be my turn

295
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,279
to have my head on the chopping block

296
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,290
just like James Gunn lord knows in the

297
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:28,459
last year I've already lost a couple

298
00:09:28,459 --> 00:09:30,230
sponsors and a couple of brand deals and

299
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,029
stuff like that because I said and done

300
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:34,129
some stupid stuff it'll continue to

301
00:09:34,129 --> 00:09:35,779
happen and eventually the world have

302
00:09:35,779 --> 00:09:37,519
turned on me the way they did James Gunn

303
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,519
today I guess but until then I'm looking

304
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:41,540
forward to seeing what you have to say

305
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,889
in the comments section but I didn't

306
00:09:42,889 --> 00:09:45,199
want to issue a challenge to you i I've

307
00:09:45,199 --> 00:09:46,879
limited my skeletons of the closet in

308
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:49,009
this video but do you have skeletons in

309
00:09:49,009 --> 00:09:51,019
your closet if he reached my level of

310
00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:53,060
YouTube notoriety or you reach James

311
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,649
Gunn's level of notoriety or there are

312
00:09:54,649 --> 00:09:56,660
things that you have said and done in

313
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,720
the past and the past 10 15 20 years

314
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,939
that would ruin you that would ruin your

315
00:10:01,939 --> 00:10:03,889
career that would toll you apart that

316
00:10:03,889 --> 00:10:05,569
would make people second-guess you or

317
00:10:05,569 --> 00:10:07,490
hate you or attack you if you are

318
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:09,800
somebody who can say no there's no

319
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,389
skeletons of my closet there's nothing I

320
00:10:11,389 --> 00:10:12,529
regret there's nothing I've ever done

321
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:14,389
know that you're the exception and not

322
00:10:14,389 --> 00:10:15,800
the rule and I would love to get to know

323
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,240
you I would love to meet you you would

324
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,589
make a great friend you probably

325
00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:20,089
wouldn't like me very much because I I

326
00:10:20,089 --> 00:10:22,279
screw up all the time but so do most of

327
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:23,420
us and I bet most of your friends have

328
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:26,029
to deal though even the worst joke I've

329
00:10:26,029 --> 00:10:28,220
made in the last 10 years and I've made

330
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:31,100
some really gross disgusting jokes I

331
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,629
still don't think any of them really

332
00:10:32,629 --> 00:10:34,370
compare to what he was saying on Twitter

333
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:37,699
truly truly offensive stuff um even in

334
00:10:37,699 --> 00:10:40,189
context it's still pretty offensive guys

335
00:10:40,189 --> 00:10:42,920
as always thanks for watching I love you

336
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,250
very much

337
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:46,000
and I'll speak with you again soon
