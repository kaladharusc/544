hey it's tomorrow it's tomorrow morning

36
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:03,180
look I got one video when I went to see

37
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,760
the total lunar no total solar eclipse

38
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,319
it was amazing but a lot of people have

39
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:09,659
been asking how did I shoot the actual

40
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:11,849
scene when the Eclipse happen because I

41
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:13,709
had a lot of coverage so I thought I

42
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:18,930
would explain first you should know I

43
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,290
had five cameras shooting simultaneously

44
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:23,669
while the Eclipse took place two of

45
00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:25,919
those cameras were flying cameras first

46
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:30,959
the perfect overhead shot about five

47
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:31,470
minutes

48
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,329
where the eclipse took place I sent a

49
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:35,609
phantom for like this straight up in the

50
00:03:35,609 --> 00:03:38,190
air about 1,500 feet above the ground

51
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:40,019
where I was standing camera pointed

52
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:41,970
straight down like this then I set the

53
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:43,799
location to lock so it wouldn't move too

54
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:45,629
much and I hit record and then I just

55
00:03:45,629 --> 00:03:47,370
kind of forgot about a second camera the

56
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,169
one that went over the crowd just as it

57
00:03:49,169 --> 00:03:52,319
got dark that was this custom Casey

58
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,720
Neistat Mavic right here setting a

59
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,970
trajectory on the app minute it got dark

60
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,530
I just hit start through the controller

61
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,689
so this thing went by itself third

62
00:04:00,689 --> 00:04:03,090
camera that was that wide-angle sping

63
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:06,030
time-lapse shot I got that by putting a

64
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:09,629
gopro hero4 on an egg timer I could Sony

65
00:04:09,629 --> 00:04:11,669
t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t and that's why in

66
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:12,900
the last shot of the video when you see

67
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,609
me pull this thing down you can actually

68
00:04:14,609 --> 00:04:18,750
hear the egg timer fourth shot that's

69
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,519
the shot of the Sun staring directly

70
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,440
into the Sun that was done using the

71
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,699
camera that I'm actually filming this on

72
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:27,710
right now which is a Panasonic Lumix gh2

73
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:30,570
h5 with a long lens on it and then I put

74
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,190
a little sunglasses over the lens to

75
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:34,650
create a filter and film the Sun I had

76
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,419
to remember to lock focus and lock

77
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:38,520
exposure before I hit record camera

78
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,960
number five was like the can

79
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,060
I talked into was like the main vlogging

80
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,970
camera and that was this year Sony rx100

81
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,520
mark 5 this I use because it has the

82
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,930
best low-light and I knew no matter how

83
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:50,430
dark it got that this thing would give

84
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,949
me like a consistent rock-solid image

85
00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:56,400
plus the big camera here was busy

86
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,090
shooting the Sun and that is how one

87
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:02,639
person shoots with five cameras to get

88
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,780
five angles to capture a minute and 44

89
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:09,720
seconds of totality are you telling me

90
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:19,349
that you built a time machine yeah that

91
00:05:19,349 --> 00:05:20,849
was Austin Texas for the South by

92
00:05:20,849 --> 00:05:29,200
Southwest Film Festival 2008

93
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,550
[Applause]

94
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,440

00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,250
organized the funding for it for that

99
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,450
they bestowed me with an executive

100
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:51,370
producer credits but this was us

101

106
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,919

me as a filmmaker my whole life I'm

113
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,880

126
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,860
my friends I love those guys in any

127
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,960
promotion I could help them with I would

128
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,120
do as if that isn't enough to celebrate

129
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,000
who produced their new smash hit

130
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,880
feature-length movie my dear friend

131
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:34,710
Oscar Oscar is one of the first people

132
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:35,970
that ever worked for my brother and me

133
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:37,770
and we hired him the day after he moved

134
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:40,140
to New York City when he was like 21 or

135
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:40,770
something

136
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:42,450
this video is him opening his Christmas

137
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:44,220
presents from Van and me I know it looks

138
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,510
like a lot of money that is like less

139
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:46,890
than one week's pay those were all one

140
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:55,010
dollar bills a movie is called good time

141
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:57,750
directed by the sastras that's Josh and

142
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:02,130
Benny produced by Oscar boysson Oscar

143
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:04,080
how did you go from being my assistant

144
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,770
to a famous big-time movie producer just

145
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:09,420
by never taking no for an answer

146
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,760
kind of following believing I could do

147
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,770
anything which I learned in the nice dad

148
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:16,050
studio alright seriously this guy would

149
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:18,660
just over and over again I'd never seen

150
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,860
anything like it you just say you're

151
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,630
smart figure it out you're smart figure

152
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:22,920
it out you're smart figure it out I

153
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,390
don't care how long it takes just make

154
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:27,000
it beautiful and that sounded a little

155
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,440
weird at the time because you're used to

156
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,910
work in a restaurant or being a

157
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:32,760
landscaper but it's actually really

158
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,350
empowering and it took me a while to

159
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,190
figure that out

160
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:37,830
and the more movies I made the more I

161
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:40,380
realized it didn't matter it kind of

162
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,480
applies to everything Oscar how did you

163
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,970
get Robert Pattinson of Twilight Fame to

164
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:47,490
star in this movie two years ago about

165
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:50,190
two years ago today Robert Pattinson saw

166
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:53,280
an image from a movie that I also

this movie or a movie yeah and Josh said

173
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:10,590
be careful because when we say we're

00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,890
going to do something we actually do it

175
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:15,440
