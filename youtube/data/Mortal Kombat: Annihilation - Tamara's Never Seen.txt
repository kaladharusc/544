1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,510
too bad you will die hi everyone my name

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,970
is Tamra chambers and this is Tamra's

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:08,760
never seen and today I am watching

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,740
Mortal Kombat annihilation and I'm

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,139
dressed as Queen siddell she also looks

6
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:15,809
just like this Halloween decoration that

7
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:20,970
I had hanging in my house so it's not

8
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,020
really any revelant

9
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,150
to why I'm telling you that just I

10
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:25,109
thought it was fun

11
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:29,519
hello too bad it is you who will die but

12
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,859
I loved the first Mortal Kombat movie I

13
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:34,200
thought it was cheesy but better than it

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,120
had any right to be definitely better

15
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,510
than a street fighter for some reasons

16
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,579
and you know Street Fighter had its own

17
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:44,820
wonderfulness but I loved it right after

18
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,350
posting that though everyone was like

19
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,090
you have to watch anihilation it's

20
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,860
amazing it's terrible it has a three

21
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,840
percent on Rotten Tomatoes which is

22
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,410
hilarious and I have been pretty excited

23
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:56,789
ever since I thought it would be a great

24
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:00,480
second episode of November so lush is

25
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,720

30
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:23,980
Hat and I had a terrible soul-sucking

31
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:26,650
time and would never revisit that movie

32
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:31,750
this I had the most fun with it was so

33
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:35,170

to be protected

42
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,619

51
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,049
of theater kids in high school who had a

52
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:30,880

00:03:14,769 --> 00:03:16,780
and do like a little clang and it's very

69
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,640
dramatic and they zoom in on the glasses

70
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,620

and it's thrilling and hilarious I wrote

84
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:53,730
this is a masterpiece in big letters

85
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:56,710
then they show you a fellow spear which

86
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,330
is this high-tech circle that can

87
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:00,760
transport you anywhere in the world in

88
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:06,100
mere hours so a plane then you actually

89
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,990
see the bellows fear and it's so much

90
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,580
better than I could have ever imagined

91
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,530
it being there standing there here's one

92
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:12,850
person here's the other person and

93
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:15,220
they're like rolling around in a circle

94
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:22,380

97
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:31,150
Earth's core to use the Velo sphere it's

98
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:32,950
cool guys it makes a ton of sense

99
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,990
scientifically and it's accurate and

100
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:37,990
just that's all we need to know I wrote

101
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:42,250
katana is hot I'm sorry that I needed to

102
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,290
just say that but I did I had to say it

103
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:46,990
she's hot and now we could all move on

104
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,070
now that I've said the thing that I

105
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:52,390
needed to say oh hey Justin long it's

106
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:54,010
not him but it looks like him then

107
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:57,400
scorpion his back and he captures katana

108
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,360
and he just yells to her friends suckers

109
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,790
runs off with her and it's amazing it's

110
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:06,700
amazing I to use that as something to

111
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:10,930
yell at people all the time then this

112
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:13,300

138
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:52,460
you do you know I'm saying then we find

139
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,620
out the Ravens dad is an elder God and

140
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,440
everyone's very surprised I don't think

141
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,470
that's very shocking but okay wow your

142
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:02,630
dad's an elder God mine is just an

143
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,420
asshole then a giant terribly CGI dragon

144
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:08,600
eat someone and then burps and I don't

145
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,840
usually like burp jokes burp bodily

146
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,390
function humor like that but this one

147
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,770
was just really well-crafted

148
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:20,270
it worked then Raiden dies then he comes

149
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:22,130
back because he's raiding you guys dad

150
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:23,810
is an elder God didn't you hear and

151
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,610
there's more family drama with katana

152
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:28,040
and her mom she was like my mother's

153
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,740
dead and the moms like as sumo beat her

154
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:33,800
daughter damn Thanksgiving is gonna be

155
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,780
awkward this year I mean it always is

156
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:40,820
but giant and fights amazing fight

157
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,160
choreo and then in giant letters I just

158
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,560
wrote oh my god with exclamation points

159
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,140
because Lou turns into a dragon and cons

160
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,730
sees that he turns the two dragons like

161
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:52,580
impressive but not good enough well you

162
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,110
need to lower your standards a bit

163
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:56,630
because it's pretty cool okay God just

164
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,900
just

165
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,470
