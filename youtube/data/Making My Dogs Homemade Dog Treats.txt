1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,410
one of my favorite things about being an

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:03,600
adult is having dogs the only thing that

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,370
comes along with that is the immense

4
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,440
amount of guilt you feel from just doing

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,469
people things without them hi welcome to

6
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:12,750
I feel guilty as you can see I've sat my

7
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,700
dogs across the counter from me June's

8
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,010
kitchen style they aren't cats they're

9
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:18,900
dogs so I imagine this might present

10
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,820
some problems at some point during this

11
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,740
video but for now they're sitting across

12
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,480
from me and crying as you can see

13
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,820
marbles is on the counter because he's

14
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,220
too little to see over it I want him to

15
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,929
feel included many of you have been

16
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:33,000
requesting that I make them leisure

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,890
suits and cook them their favorite meal

18
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:37,079
well I bought a piece of fabric that I'm

19
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:39,239
gonna drape around them in a cape and

20
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:40,890
I'm gonna cook them some treats so I

21
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:42,300
feel like this is the happy medium

22
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,219
carmit why you crying the only one that

23
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:46,020

25
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,230

26
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:51,870

watermelon before we get cooking because

37
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,330

38
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:25,320

00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:06,850
one oh my god my ball please just relax

81
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:09,910
my ball we might have to lose marble for

82
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,560
part of the show he doesn't seem to be

83
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,420
enjoying himself what is this not

84
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,250
entertaining to you marble this is

85
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:18,130
boiling hot oil do you understand what

86
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:19,720
that means and then I'm gonna put a

87
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,820
couple of little blueberries in each one

88
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,760
so then when they eat it they also get a

89
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,790
blueberry surprise so we've lost one of

90
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,400
our participants he would not stop

91
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,890
walking around the counter towards the

92
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:35,410
piping hot oil because he wanted a hug

93
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:37,840
so the next treat that I thought I would

94
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,310
make is something to keep their

95
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,950
attention so I found a recipe that I

96
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:44,170
stole on Pinterest yet again of a

97
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:46,510
no-bake sort of dog treat that I can

98
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:48,130
feed to them relatively quickly

99
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:51,040

177
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:14,990
put these in the freezer and we can have

178
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:16,580
them on the hot day are you gonna finish

179
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,140

180
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,510
the counter it's messy see I told you

181
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,950
you're gonna have a good time you just

182
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:24,530
didn't believe me moving on to the last

183
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:26,540
thing that I'm going to make for my dogs

184
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,640
which if they don't like I'm gonna be

185
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,040
really pissed I'm gonna make like a

186
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,950
traditional dog biscuit that has like

187
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,960
banana and peanut butter there's like a

188
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,330
lot of different recipes of dog biscuits

189
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,160
but I think like peanut butter is

190
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,570
something that they really enjoy it like

191
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:43,310
a lot along with coconut oil so if we

192
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:45,230
stay in that vein I think we're gonna be

193
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:47,810
good this recipe that I stole from

194
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:50,690
Pinterest is half a banana a cup of

195
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:53,030
we're gonna use coconut flour 1/3 a cup

196
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:55,400
of peanut butter 2 tablespoons of ground

197
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,130
flax and some almond milk and that's it

198
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:59,930
and then we bake them should I'd like to

199
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:01,669
do something more entertaining I'm sorry

200
00:08:01,669 --> 00:08:03,200
it's not a Benihana and I haven't lit

201
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,750
anything on fire or squirt alcohol in

202
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,460
your mouth from over here should I chop

203
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,350
an egg into the air I mean to be fair

204
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:11,150
you didn't pay anything to be here so

205
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:14,450
what would you like half of banana don't

206
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:16,100
do anything areas with that oh it's too

207
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,860
late

208
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:22,430
why are you crying do two tablespoon of

209
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:25,480
ground flax cuz I'm just gonna eyeball

210
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,380
because we're cooking for dogs so

211
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:37,010

212
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:39,180

214
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:47,340
biscuits Oh peaches very excited I guess

215
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,260
you could just feed it to them raw like

216
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,270
this they're dogs I mean they could eat

217
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:53,640
a whole pigeon Rauf they felt like it

218
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,550
we've lost our audience the dogs have

219
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,680
left you didn't want a leisure you

220
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,720
wanted to prowl the ground for treats

221
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,700
even though I'm making you treats if you

222
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,140
could just be patient

223
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,000
you'd have nice home-cooked biscuits

224
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,640
nobody cares about me or my efforts all

225
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,340
right we have done a nice little

226
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,800
assortment of shapes we got some stars

227
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,840
some hearts and butterflies the dogs

228
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,250
aren't gonna be able to tell because

229
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,440
they can't fucking understand what that

230
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,140
is but hopefully they'll like these I'm

231
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,690
gonna put them in the oven all in a

232
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:28,650
day's work of love was it necessary no

233
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:31,620
but I feel like it's a nice gesture that

234
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,410
says I'm sorry for being busy lately and

235
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:37,770
not taking into the dog park as much as

236
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:40,920

280
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:40,470

where he is and he like that cookie I

289
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,779
will say I'm a little disappointed at

290
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:05,970
their ability to leisure or for those of

291
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:07,199
you that we're hoping that they would

292
00:12:07,199 --> 00:12:07,890
leisure

293
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:10,410
we tried they hated it but they loved

294
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:12,570
the food so mission accomplished this

295
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:14,190
was really nice though and I would say

296
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:16,560
as someone that has had dogs for ten

297
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,440
years I've never like baked them or made

298
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,709
them homemade treats or biscuits or

299
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:25,380
anything this is like a really fun use

300
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,630
of time like this was worth it there are

301
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,370
many things that I do in life that I'm

302
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:31,769
not worth the time that I put into them

303
00:12:31,769 --> 00:12:33,660
this is one of them this was really nice

304
