2
00:00:07,889 --> 00:00:09,730
for a second I thought I was about to

3
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:11,139
watch roughly which I would greatly

4
00:00:11,139 --> 00:00:13,330
prefer also the filmmakers back in 2002

5
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:14,799
thought it would be a good idea to name

6
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:16,180
their movie after the commonly known

7
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:18,160
symbol for hardcore sex or when your

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,720
team runs out of guesses and family feud

9
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,310
removing your disguise at the scene of

10
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:23,380
the crime 3 shoulda left it on tickets

11
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:24,789
drive down this alley rather than

12
00:00:24,789 --> 00:00:26,230
running right the Scout was able to walk

13
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:27,700
into the secret Rammstein concert

14
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:28,960
without paying or giving the secret

15
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,150
password just too big of yet suffering

16
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:34,960
the five that is you can do how she's in

17
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,250
there a point where you just lose a guy

18
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:37,600
in the middle of a concert even if this

19
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,160
is the brightest lit venue I've ever

20
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,079
seen for a metal concert in my life I'd

21
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:42,820
lose most assholes I'm chasing steak

22
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,500
James Bond's corpse isn't literally

23
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,160
getting blood on the hands of the crowd

24
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,660
this whooshing deep down and into a new

25
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:51,579
location seems a lot less badass when

26
00:00:51,579 --> 00:00:53,620
you think of it as the wins POV budget

27
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,239
touched at the NSA I mean they can't fix

28
00:00:55,239 --> 00:00:56,710
the elevator doors to slide all the way

29
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:59,649
into the walls a 1999 oh is that related

30
00:00:59,649 --> 00:01:01,329
to the Ray Liotta keep your Sutherland

31
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:03,219
doctor movie called article 99 I'm

32
00:01:03,219 --> 00:01:04,899
pretty sure this gangs name is equally

33
00:01:04,899 --> 00:01:06,700
forgettable best and brightest the

34
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,439
bottom of barrel has a scum of the earth

35
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:11,229
and they're programmable bendable and

36
00:01:11,229 --> 00:01:13,600
they work hmm I guess the movie xxx was

37
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,310
sort of the Suicide Squad before Suicide

38
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:17,049
Squad also isn't it the first time

39
00:01:17,049 --> 00:01:18,490

40
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:19,869
he know that they work in case you

41
00:01:19,869 --> 00:01:21,249
confused it with Sacramento Minnesota

42
00:01:21,249 --> 00:01:23,020
that anyone who owns a car like that

43
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,639
would ever put a bumper sticker on it

44
00:01:24,639 --> 00:01:26,380
also this comically large bumper sticker

45
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,029
this guy put on his expensive sports car

46
00:01:28,029 --> 00:01:29,289
tells you everything you need to know

47
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:29,979
about his character

48
00:01:29,979 --> 00:01:31,929

00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,619
coated racism I don't want the pain to

53
00:01:38,619 --> 00:01:40,240
fade Jesus if he is not worried about

54
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,619
the paint then why the fuck is there a

55
00:01:41,619 --> 00:01:42,700
giant bumper sticker on the back

56
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,829
director Rob Cohen and actor Vin Diesel

57
00:01:44,829 --> 00:01:46,779

58
00:01:46,779 --> 00:01:49,929
velocity dick dick Hotchkiss a

59
00:01:49,929 --> 00:01:52,359
California state senator he's the guy

60
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:54,249
that tried to ban rock music because we

61
00:01:54,249 --> 00:01:55,869
deals with the lyrics promote violence

62
00:01:55,869 --> 00:01:57,759
and I stole in this car which I'm going

63
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,349
to jump off a bridge because I feel like

64
00:01:59,349 --> 00:02:00,669
I'll be able to change his voting habit

65
00:02:00,669 --> 00:02:01,989
somehow even though the insurance and

66
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:02,950
the fact that he's a wealthy state

67
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,719
senator will easily replace this car

68
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,609
he's also the guy that wants to pull

69
00:02:06,609 --> 00:02:08,560
every video game up every shelf of the

70
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,910
country he's going to have a hard time

71
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,410
doing that considering he's only a state

72
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:13,180
senator also the main character of this

73
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:13,670
movie is

74
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:15,650
hardcore pandering asshole I like rap

75
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:17,060
music and skateboards and video games

76
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,310
and I will fight for you white males age

77
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,650
13 to 24 watching this movie is the

78
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,090
footage we're seeing the footage these

79
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:24,560
cameras are actually shooting or is this

80
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,700
what it was like to watch videos like

81
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,560
this on the internet back in 2002 yes

82
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,880
you're a bad man

83
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:32,230
you know we did about nine elected yet

84
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:36,080
you've just entered the Xander zone

85
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,580
that's also what Xander tells himself

86
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:39,290
before he masturbates she's cops formed

87
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:40,850
a roadblock at the end of the bridge but

88
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:42,380
decided a ramp in the middle of the road

89
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,819
could just stay there because there's no

90
00:02:43,819 --> 00:02:45,560
way that'll be used for anything after

91
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,180
30 seconds of admittedly slow-motion

92
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,010
falling this car is only halfway down I

93
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,180
think you guys are abusing your

94
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,400
slow-motion privileges moral is don't

95
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,080
for your dirt jerk

96
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,209
haha his name is dick and he's a dick

97
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:58,400
haha Sanders xxx tattoo is not on his

98
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,870
neck hopefully he didn't leave it in the

99
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,880
car I think the rule for movies is if

100
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,440
you ride motorcycles and you're sort of

101
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,880
a lone wolf character it is required

102
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,019
your apartment has one of these

103
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,489
elevators with the sliding cages on the

104
00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:09,709
Ian Ghost Writer are roomies I think for

105
00:03:09,709 --> 00:03:11,060
the scene I'm just going to add a sin

106
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,350
for every single time somebody says

107
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:13,819
something they think is cool lingo and

108
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:19,640
oh okay man why also for a dude that

109
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,329
doesn't like dicks

110
00:03:20,329 --> 00:03:21,829
Xander sure hangs out with a lot of them

111
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:24,079
you know an athlete like you should

112
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,790
really have his own video game video

113
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,500
game companies are so high on licensing

114
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,209
wanted men these days I mean who could

115
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,680
forget that classic thanks he gave it

116
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,299
was all the rage oh no one they made for

117
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:34,670
Bernie Madoff called Ponzi crush look I

118
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:36,380
just need you to lay low to the Heat's

119
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,450
off okay I got an underground web site

120
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:40,130
in one each character and her haircut

121
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:42,320
inspiring ugh Julian Assange I guess

122
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,970
we'll never know I'm untouchable

123
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:49,100
ironic retort in three two right on time

124
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,930
Cindy soul is known for his action films

125
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,820
deep voice ripped body and Dungeons &amp;

126
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,440
Dragons fandom but what he should be

127
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,120
known for is his beautiful eyelashes in

128
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,590
this scenario they dreamed up for Xander

129
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:58,790
the waitress knew there was a robbery

130
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:00,200
before the two guys even pulled their

131
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,700
guns out to rob the place and of course

132
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,290
as we're about to find out the scenario

133
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:04,970
is way too easy to defend it's like they

134
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:06,319
got this movie screenwriter to plan the

135
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,780
fake robbery I was a bit groggy before

136
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,910
then I started noticing things I hate to

137
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,230
admit it but as Xander goes through all

138
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:13,430
the mistakes these people made and

139
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:14,959
coming up with a realistic scenario it's

140
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,400
clear he'd be amazing at cinema since

141
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,160
reading the Financial Times on a Sunday

142
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,769
morning when the markets closed hey wait

143
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:23,630
I thought you said he's not a fellow but

144
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,190
only I fell out would know that see I

145
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,840
can be observant too and know

146
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,550
cents but their performances were

147
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:36,290
terrible that's good it's very good as

148
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:37,729
opposed to these performances which are

149
00:04:37,729 --> 00:04:39,590
excellent Italy is determined to get its

150
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:40,940
hundred bucks worth out of a fake tattoo

151
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,100
you guys have sent them in diners

152
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:46,250
rightly our diner finalist everybody on

153
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,810
this plane did the diner test did they

154
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:49,220
all beat up the fake robbers because

155
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,810
that is a ton of abuse for those actors

156
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:51,889
to go through the play on a stupid

157
00:04:51,889 --> 00:04:53,540
scenario like that or did several actors

158
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,830
take turns playing the robbers and the

159
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,090
government just happens to have like 20

160
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,410
expendable people on their payroll who

161
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:58,940
can get beat up in a fantasy robbery I

162
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:01,190
live with this getting kidnapped by the

163
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:05,630
government oh this is Columbia okay bad

164
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,880
so you hear people speaking Spanish and

165
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,550
you see cocaine so must be Colombia yes

166
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,470
I sell this sir I would like to know why

167
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:13,639
the government decided to throw these

168
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:15,410
guys into the real world of drug cartels

169
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:16,880
without giving them one detail and

170
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,260
hoping that would work exams are just

171
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,789
set the record in 13 minutes of screen

172
00:05:19,789 --> 00:05:21,229
time for getting not the couch it

173
00:05:21,229 --> 00:05:22,460
wouldn't be a Vin Diesel movie if you

174
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,840
work force to be shackled and hanging

175
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,580
from something also why are the two guys

176
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,810
who ran sitting in relative comfort

177
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:28,630
while XXX has to hang from the rafters

178
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:31,160
well they went all out on wrestling huh

179
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,270
does they even really think this is

180
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,560
still a desk I might have to get this

181
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,850
movie credit for inspiring Tropic

182
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:39,470
Thunder are they laughing because they

183
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,419
think it's actually Danny Trejo just two

184
00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:43,490
seconds ago you told us to talk now it's

185
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:46,250
shut up I mean in effect you haven't

186
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,570
worth it is torture

187
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:50,090
holy I just realized that cinemasins is

188
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:51,860
Xander cage and for that I'm sorry

189
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:55,099
I think Matt Besler smells like real

190
00:05:55,099 --> 00:05:57,530
blood good god this movie set up Xander

191
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:58,789
to be smarter than the average asshole

192
00:05:58,789 --> 00:06:00,020
and he's only now beginning to realize

193
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,970
this might be real I think this is why

194
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,500
he's never tie someone up like this with

195
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,849
their legs still mobile I'll never

196
00:06:04,849 --> 00:06:07,370
understand movie tortures how is it you

197
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:08,510
mean there with a large bag of cocaine

198
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,190
just lying around in the torture barn of

199
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,810
course the only viable vehicle Xander

200
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:13,340
finds is the one that fits his lifestyle

201
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,110
sander Lux out with the Colombian army

202
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,849
shoot around the target philosophy even

203
00:06:16,849 --> 00:06:17,930
though his motorcycle was clearly

204
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:19,370
leveling out right here the wide shot

205
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:20,750
disagrees with all the previous physics

206
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,070
and decides you know what he shot a

207
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,120
hundred feet into the air

208
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,259
not just 32

209
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:28,969
what and despite having to maneuver his

210
00:06:28,969 --> 00:06:30,919
way around barbed wire and he sticks the

211
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:32,599
landing apparently there's nothing you

212
00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:34,069
can't do when you're on a motorcycle the

213
00:06:34,069 --> 00:06:35,419
next thing we'll see is him flying up to

214
00:06:35,419 --> 00:06:36,469
the army helicopter and somehow

215
00:06:36,469 --> 00:06:38,059
attaching a bomb like he did in Furious

216
00:06:38,059 --> 00:06:39,889
7 after avoiding this helicopter by

217
00:06:39,889 --> 00:06:41,179
weaving around the entire compound

218
00:06:41,179 --> 00:06:43,099
apparently there is just no other option

219
00:06:43,099 --> 00:06:44,719
than to jump over this barn as it gets

220
00:06:44,719 --> 00:06:46,189
bombed looks like the flames are

221
00:06:46,189 --> 00:06:47,869
touching possibly engulfing in here but

222
00:06:47,869 --> 00:06:49,669
he'll manage to leave this unscathed and

223
00:06:49,669 --> 00:06:51,110
now Xander will slide into the most

224
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:52,879
convenient pipe ever created perfectly

225
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:54,619
located for a jump over an exploding

226
00:06:54,619 --> 00:06:56,089
barn and big enough to fit him and his

227
00:06:56,089 --> 00:06:58,069
motorcycle so you can hide the Colombian

228
00:06:58,069 --> 00:07:00,319
Army has moving in excuse me it was my

229
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,719
idea Daniel as a decoy and liked the

230
00:07:02,719 --> 00:07:04,459
idea as a decoy for what

231
00:07:04,459 --> 00:07:06,050
what exactly did putting Xander and the

232
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,610
other two dudes in danger accomplish

233
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:08,990
that wouldn't happened anyway decoy

234
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:10,490
suggests they needed him to do this in

235
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:11,779
order to attract attention but the

236
00:07:11,779 --> 00:07:13,550
Colombian army was already moving in so

237
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:14,779
what was accomplished other than the

238
00:07:14,779 --> 00:07:16,969
excuse of having a rad action scene the

239
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:19,279
job's not that difficult it's not while

240
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:21,019
the agent deaths then maybe I ought to

241
00:07:21,019 --> 00:07:23,389
call yourself chip black every rolled

242
00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:25,399
credits yet we haven't I saw is Anders

243
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:26,659
neck tattoos so many times I just

244
00:07:26,659 --> 00:07:28,219
assumed we had in case you confused it

245
00:07:28,219 --> 00:07:30,589
for Parag Mozambique also I guess even

246
00:07:30,589 --> 00:07:32,539
the anti James Bond movie have to find a

247
00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:33,979
way to get its hero in Prague somehow

248
00:07:33,979 --> 00:07:35,659
it's where all the secret agent goes

249
00:07:35,659 --> 00:07:37,369
down I'm sorry did I miss the part in

250
00:07:37,369 --> 00:07:38,839
film studies that explains why the Dutch

251
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:40,369
angle makes a terrible movie better I

252
00:07:40,369 --> 00:07:42,079
think this movie is made with 56% Dutch

253
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,550
angles but it's hard to believe anyone

254
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:44,839
thought they were making art with this

255
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:48,019
movie either longing one so much my loan

256
00:07:48,019 --> 00:07:49,309
I guess this expression loses something

257
00:07:49,309 --> 00:07:50,839
in the chick to English translation

258
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:52,669
probably sounds really badass I'm not

259
00:07:52,669 --> 00:07:55,639
stupid in Czech - I've never been under

260
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:57,919
anyone's jurisdiction samuel l jackson

261
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,479
just blackmailed you with the threat of

262
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,209
prison time so going to have to disagree

263
00:08:01,209 --> 00:08:04,399
hey guys I'm America New York you're

264
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:04,819

265
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:07,339
argue a guy to talk to about cars how in

266
00:08:07,339 --> 00:08:08,629
the world is barging in going to get

267
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:10,699
this guy's respect or work I guess this

268
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:12,110
whole movies theme is if you're totally

269
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:13,279
unconventional and don't even think

270
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:14,240
about it you'll succeed in this world

271
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,189
where the implants burns drink through

272
00:08:16,189 --> 00:08:18,559
flashing his badge to have to bar the

273
00:08:18,559 --> 00:08:20,149
bad guy never thinks to himself dad this

274
00:08:20,149 --> 00:08:21,769
guy traveled a great distance just to

275
00:08:21,769 --> 00:08:23,329
see me when he Luck's out by finding a

276
00:08:23,329 --> 00:08:25,069
cop flashing his badge at a bar known

277
00:08:25,069 --> 00:08:27,050
for being run by criminals and we've had

278
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:28,459
to kill a string of secret agents lately

279
00:08:28,459 --> 00:08:30,079
because of my operation oh well I'll

280
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:31,339
make a deal with this guy and trust him

281
00:08:31,339 --> 00:08:33,380
why not and this is movie back in 2002

282
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,059
and all the years after that but I'm

283
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:36,589
going to go ahead and predict that Asia

284
00:08:36,589 --> 00:08:38,269
Argento is an undercover agent and that

285
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:38,750
our

286
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,909
is the director of Suspiria Ferrari I

287
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:43,190
had pasta rocket Sessler

288
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,080
that feels like a flirt now the business

289
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,960
is finished with parking basis calm

290
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,240
bitches oh they're gaggle of bitches

291

just waiting to be sent to this room

292
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,420

293
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,890
bitches when he barged in here if there

294
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:56,030

295
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,350
couldn't have heard this guy in a loud

296
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:59,180
Club from up here I'm just shocked they

297
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,470
have party bitches ready to go to a

298
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:02,000
moment's notice is all she was given a

299
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,920
specific list of cars to go after who

300
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,960
told you alternate lists the cars on

301
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,580
that list suck it would have seen right

302
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,290
through it is there anybody in this

303
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:10,640
government outfit that knows how to sell

304
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,110
an undercover story how the hell'd you

305
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:14,360
get all this Kolya Yogi's younger

306
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,340
brother happens to be an action sports

307
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,620
fanatic we kill a bottle of vodka and

308
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,880
three fridge and you're going to talk

309
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,800
too much so this guy told you everything

310
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,420
about all the guys in the operation and

311
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,190
you just sat there and entered it into a

312
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,870
laptop or wrote it in a notebook or

313
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:27,950
memorized it for later

314
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:29,270
I imagine the scene was in the script

315
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,620
but you guys decided not to film it

316
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,330
because of how unbelievable it is this

317
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:34,520
one made my career so the thinking for

318
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,410
this character was xxx need to cube

319
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,880
but he needs to be as annoying as

320
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,060
possible every little boy's dream the

321
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,190
penetrator mode you know for those

322
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:45,500
peeping tom james moms out there also is

323
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:50,750
her skeleton getting him excited I am

324
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,280
unsure of the sturdiness of old factory

325
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,630
windows in Prague but this seems

326
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:54,890
excessive even by Buster Keaton

327
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:56,660
standards so from the perspective of

328
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,940
these Czech criminals xxx is now a Robin

329
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,740
Hood style car thief with a profitable

330
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,180
series of underground extreme sports

331
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,160
films who also merged police officer

332
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,960
even though everybody suspected Zander

333
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,490
being a secret agent and several known

334
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:08,900
agents have died trying to stop this

335
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,460
gang nobody checked to see if this cop

336
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,260
is really dead why do you do that to

337
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:15,170
yourself that figure is gonna kill you

338
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:17,060
one day setting up an ironic death by

339
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,010
the henchmen if I could I smoked in my

340
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:21,440
sleep I will still do it after it kills

341
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,230
me yeah well you're dead so why not I'm

342
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:25,880
guessing once you're dead the risks go

343
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,620
way down a thousand people at the party

344
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,030
and only two other people waiting at the

345
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,380
bar you're gay should give up his life

346
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,880
of crime and focus on party planning

347
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,430
because that's impressive how long was

348
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:35,839
she waiting on that bedpost for him to

349
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,790
walk in also these candles don't set the

350
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:39,560
mood in any way I'm either worried the

351
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,060
mansion is going to burn down or that

352
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,140
I've joined a vampire cult

353
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,760
either way my boner is going to retreat

354
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,230
somewhere further down the Maslow's

355
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:47,600
hierarchy of needs pyramid also did she

356
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,950
light all those candles herself there's

357
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,750
there's some kind of prostitute henchmen

358
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,769
who gets stuck with the

359
00:10:51,769 --> 00:10:53,839
work you're not supposed to win here in

360
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,339
the giant room where they held a party a

361
00:10:55,339 --> 00:10:57,199
few hours earlier and is also like us a

362
00:10:57,199 --> 00:10:59,300
makeshift library very sorry we didn't

363
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,499
get to see the Ferris Bueller's Day Off

364
00:11:00,499 --> 00:11:02,509
style shenanigans with the maitre d when

365
00:11:02,509 --> 00:11:03,589
they tried to book a table in that

366
00:11:03,589 --> 00:11:05,119
restaurant dressed like that he is

367
00:11:05,119 --> 00:11:07,579
waiting off hunt with this rifle are you

368
00:11:07,579 --> 00:11:08,839
telling me this guy couldn't get a clean

369
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:10,699
shot through the window I mean move a

370
00:11:10,699 --> 00:11:11,569
little to the left

371
00:11:11,569 --> 00:11:13,489
Jesus the son just happens to be in the

372
00:11:13,489 --> 00:11:14,869
perfect position for Xander to blind

373
00:11:14,869 --> 00:11:16,309
this guy with a metal trick treat

374
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:18,769
morning skate train also how in the fuck

375
00:11:18,769 --> 00:11:19,850
does this guy even have a good shot

376
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:21,290
anymore you'll notice they never show

377
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:22,730
his perspective again because there's no

378
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:24,139
way he does have a good shot anymore

379
00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:25,850
said Americans can just bust in and use

380
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:27,319
a historic Opera House while it's being

381
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:28,970
used for dress rehearsals for secret

382
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:30,019
mission things like planning

383
00:11:30,019 --> 00:11:32,119
extrajudicial killings it's exactly why

384
00:11:32,119 --> 00:11:33,319
we have a mixed reputation around the

385
00:11:33,319 --> 00:11:34,579
world they're being very rude to that

386
00:11:34,579 --> 00:11:36,319
opera singer Jelena just told Zander

387
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,670
she's never allowed down into the

388
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,259
underground weapons lab but mere hours

389
00:11:39,259 --> 00:11:40,699
later she's being led here at the very

390
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:42,350
moment Xander's gone Rogen is following

391
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:43,579
her everything's going according to the

392
00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:45,739
screenwriters plan plan in the other lab

393
00:11:45,739 --> 00:11:47,119
rats down in an underground secret

394
00:11:47,119 --> 00:11:48,829
weapons facility but they passed the lab

395
00:11:48,829 --> 00:11:50,480
rat stage of the illegal biological

396
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,029
weapons production if a head should have

397
00:11:53,029 --> 00:11:54,860
finished a book dude straight now xxx

398
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,389
has to fight with a boner these x-rays

399
00:11:56,389 --> 00:11:57,889
and oculars are way too good to be

400
00:11:57,889 --> 00:11:59,809
showing him an exact hi-def picture of

401
00:11:59,809 --> 00:12:01,189
everything going on behind this wall

402
00:12:01,189 --> 00:12:03,139
much let's take a picture of it s oh

403
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:05,689
yeah by who got sent out to buy a bow

404
00:12:05,689 --> 00:12:07,279
for the detonator except they find a

405
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,079
crass Closet in a mansion and think oh I

406
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:10,249
know just what to do with this let's

407
00:12:10,249 --> 00:12:15,439
give a surprise to your DG tonight this

408
00:12:15,439 --> 00:12:16,910
may be the densest motherfucker I've

409
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,439
ever seen in the movie you see the organ

410
00:12:18,439 --> 00:12:19,819
behind the glass with a controller and

411
00:12:19,819 --> 00:12:21,439
it doesn't occur to him oh this must be

412
00:12:21,439 --> 00:12:23,329
on purpose how did he get up here and

413
00:12:23,329 --> 00:12:24,920
convenient rocky ceiling is convenient

414
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,629
castle which already has a huge gate in

415
00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:27,679
front of it also had room for a

416
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:29,119
drawbridge which looks recently

417
00:12:29,119 --> 00:12:30,439
installed in order to expedite

418
00:12:30,439 --> 00:12:32,179
motorcycle ramp jumps I have no doubt

419
00:12:32,179 --> 00:12:33,799
this stuff was awesome but when you show

420
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:34,999
the bare minimum of what this guy is

421
00:12:34,999 --> 00:12:36,740
actually jumping to and from it loses

422
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:40,009
all coolest sajo Xander who only came

423
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,480
back because the love of his life Yelena

424
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,040
was still here blows up all these cars

425
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,959
and possibly Elena with them wooden

426
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:45,709
undershooting

427
00:12:45,709 --> 00:12:47,240
apparently that's exactly why he's here

428
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,829
but despite having all the leverage he

429
00:12:48,829 --> 00:12:51,009
decides to talk his way to his own death

430
00:12:51,009 --> 00:12:52,970
Elena somehow knew this guy was sitting

431
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:54,319
behind the store in order to make these

432
00:12:54,319 --> 00:12:56,389
blind shops and ex machina the situation

433
00:12:56,389 --> 00:12:58,100
in short order also how did she get here

434
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,869
in time Sandra was way ahead after

435
00:12:59,869 --> 00:13:01,160
blowing up all those cars at the mansion

436
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,839
but here's Elena like time and space

437
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:04,730
don't matter I had a deep talk I can

438
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:05,030
tell

439
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:08,720
we're in the room hahahaha I'm an agent

440
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:14,120
as well what no way the secret room was

441
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,400
where if I told you not to jump off the

442
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,990
Empire State Building yeah you're right

443
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:19,070
I definitely do it

444
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:21,140
see I inspired you no no you didn't

445
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,760
actually Xander already said he wanted

446
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,260
to stay and help out the girl the new

447
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,580
information would have happened with or

448
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,900
without the bullshit about the sweeper

449
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,280
team or telling Xander he needed to go

450
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,590
home some homes and that's an order he

451
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:31,970
gives this order after getting the same

452
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:33,740
order to inspire him in a previous scene

453
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,510
either he actually means at this time or

454
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,010
he still thinks he needs to fire him

455
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:38,750
further by the way I request for this

456
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,190
movie to stop wasting my time

457
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:43,880
remember what I told you to kiss very

458
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:50,270
good ally a rare example of music

459
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,770
ruining the moment rather than enhancing

460
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:53,600
it wait these guys knew to be looking

461
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,860
for somebody skiing down the mountain

462
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,270
did they kick him out a trigger an

463
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,740
avalanche during his two hours in spy

464
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,150
school just wanted to make sure we

465
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,290
pointed out that Xander is out

466
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:02,090
snowboarding an avalanche right now just

467
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:03,230
in case you didn't see that with your

468
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:04,790
own eyes which are king lying to you

469
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,800
also starting this avalanche was perhaps

470
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,690
necessary but also certain death

471
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:10,250
I believe Xander is as good as the movie

472
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,630
says he is at doing all the stunts it

473
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:13,220
claims he can but I highly doubt he's

474
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,020
tested those skills against an avalanche

475
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,510
for cots to show this stupid stunt so

476
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:18,560
movie wants you to be enthralled with

477
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,790
this but your brain definitely knows

478
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:20,120
better

479
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,490
avalanche again please quit please quit

480
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:24,710
please quit nothing like fresh powder ah

481
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:27,020
there it is the good stuff just movies

482
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,550
marketing focus too much on the action

483
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:30,410
and not enough on how stamp fantastic

484
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:31,280
everyone's Cotard

485
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,070
why don't they kill him now who knows

486
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:36,890

487

00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,410
world implode both on your new world

492
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,530
underground bunker like an evil Kyle

493
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:50,300
Reese or something you love going to VIP

494
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,800
rooms and having parties and hanging out

495
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,990
mansions call once again people who are

496
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:55,970
totally blind X muck in a situation at

497
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:57,590
the perfect height you have to turn the

498
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:58,490
safety off

499
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:00,650
sander cage no or of everything somehow

500
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,120
didn't know his gun safety was on

501
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,740
probably so we could see Elena be a

502
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,510
badass for a couple seconds saying

503
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,580
laughs oh what a great friendship this

504
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:10,730
movie forgot to depict it's correct

505
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:13,070
seeker the son of a bitches smoking so

506
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:15,170
heat-seeking Rockets would be attracted

507
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:16,370
to something as small as a cigarette

508
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:18,380
almost like the manufacturers made these

509
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,670
so that those cigarettes will kill you

510
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,200
line could come back to office dude I

511
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,670
told him that cigarette were children

512
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:23,240
one day

513
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,650
unfortunately you reminded us of it

514
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,180
rather than letting us remember on our

515
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:28,400
own wood you got the manual he's got

516
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,680
very bad handwriting and written manual

517
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,540
for a car that can boost up you better

518
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,950
call in some air support we may need to

519
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:36,020
blow this thing out more kind of insane

520
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,640
is that you knew everything about the

521
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,470
a.m. but decided against having law

522
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:41,000
enforcement or military anywhere near

523
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,140
the water just in case something like

524
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,880
this happens then their city won't die

525
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,740
and the crisis will be contained

526
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,720
yeah wiping out 1.5 million people in

527
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,340
Prague seems like a thing the world will

528
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,440
just let go does this road go back to

529
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,320

530
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,180
table sovaldi and I'm sure you'll be

531
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,740
able to drive your car the current speed

532
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,820
without running into any traffic

533
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,710
standard shoots a goddamn harpoon in a

534
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,570
speeding car towards a speeding boat and

535
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:04,220
hits it dead center because your face

536
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,170
did that idiot queue get this shipped in

537
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:07,430
from the states or did he find an

538
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:08,930
American flag parachute in the Czech

539
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:09,530
Republic

540
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:11,780
Amazon circa 2002 was good but not that

541
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,430
good I don't want to say that every

542
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,080
missile is a phallic symbol of dominance

543
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,730
but these particular missiles weed me no

544
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:17,180
choice

545
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,680
which he steals the mix in the compound

546
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,570
bow in the samuel l.jackson from die

547
