1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:11,190
41 seconds of logos by how many millions

2
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,320
do you think FedEx outbid UPS for the

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,639
product placement here let's be honest

4
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:15,839
you can find a hundred different ways to

5
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:16,949
write a guy onto a deserted island

6
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:18,359
without it involving a worldwide

7
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:20,039
shipping leader so this was scripted as

8
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:21,270
product placement to help fund the film

9
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,070
yes that's right this movie about a man

10
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:24,840
who spends years on a deserted island

11
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,310
and befriending a volleyball starts with

12
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,199
a box lid view of a package being sent

13
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:29,490
from a wife in Texas to her cheating

14
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:32,369
husband in Russia while the intrigue

15
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:33,600
surrounding this package might make a

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,130
great movie we're four minutes in and

17
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,660
all we've seen is a very twisted FedEx

18
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,250
commercial kid runs through barricade

19
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,809
and guard blows his whistle at him which

20
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:41,280
kind of proves the in efficacy of

21
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,899
whistles if you ask me I took the

22
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:45,960
liberty to myself okay but why did you

23
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,129
send the package to this restaurant

24
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:48,780
first so that this kid had to run a mile

25
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:49,410
to get to you

26
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:50,760
why not deliver it straight here unless

27
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,440
you just love giving this kid candy bars

28
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:58,109
and CD player God almost all of this

29
00:00:58,109 --> 00:00:59,850
movies opening is useless wasteful and

30
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:01,920
makes me angry look at that cheese that

31
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,780
have Ian T that none of that stuff ends

32
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,220
up on the eventually crash plane and

33
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,840
washing ashore to the island along with

34
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,310
the ice skates and the volleyballs

35
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,930
honestly how many minutes of setup did

36
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,490
you need in order to know his life was

37
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:12,900
fast paced and he was a very successful

38
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,909
smart guy prior to being shipwrecked my

39
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:16,560
guess is it's way less than 10 and yet

40
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,009
here we are

41
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:19,170
today's truck was two minutes late the

42
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,560
models would be four minutes late you

43
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,100
know the US man in Russia serious

44
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,390
question does the US Postal Service

45
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:29,729
deliver mail to Moscow about this doctor

46
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:31,439
down in Emory in Atlanta it's been a

47
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,970
while since I've seen this movie it's

48
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,590
Stan's wife's cancer responsible for

49
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:35,880
Chuck's plane crashing on the island

50
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,020
they sure have spent a long time on it

51
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,729
after the previous year's the Green Mile

52
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:40,409
where he was married to Bonnie Hunt Tom

53
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:41,939
Hanks decided to date Helen Hunt in this

54
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:43,560
movie it's the rear back-to-back love

55
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,299
interest game known in Hollywood as the

56
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:46,829
hump double just in case you have any

57
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:48,119
doubt about Chuck's adventuring

58
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:49,439
capabilities here's a bunch of pictures

59
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,210
plaques and books so that assholes like

60
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:52,950
us won't say how does this ordinary dude

61
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,899
survive on a deserted island damn this

62
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:55,590
is overkill

63
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,759
looks like they invited home for the

64
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,799
holidays the Family Stone home alone and

65
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,509
National Lampoon's Christmas vacation to

66
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:00,960
this dinner

67
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,079
holy how do you get a table that size

68
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:05,399
Christmas I got a gift for you is it

69
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:06,750
something super on-the-nose thematically

70
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,640
like a watch I hope it's a watch no one

71
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,899
will be seated during the Chuck and

72
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:11,459
Kelly exchange Christmas gifts before he

73
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:13,080
gets on a plane and he buried the lede

74
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,840
by not giving her

75
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,920
the engagement ring that he planned to

76
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,590
give her all along Xin Jie's it's almost

77
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:21,099
like he wants his plane to crash I bet

78
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,330
you forgot that this movie takes a full

79
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:24,489
goddamn 21 minutes to even begin to cast

80
00:02:24,489 --> 00:02:25,220
anyone away

81
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:28,800
[Music]

82
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,690
jesus basket-weaving Christ Chuck finds

83
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:33,370
the airplane seatbelt in under point

84
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:34,840
zero five seconds an impossibility

85
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,160
that's more impossible than him

86
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,959
surviving this plane crash he's going

87
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:39,849
after the watch man the power of boners

88
00:02:39,849 --> 00:02:42,160
is stupid okay this crash is pretty

89
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:42,760
spectacular

90
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,349
it's worth of sin often you know a

91
00:02:44,349 --> 00:02:46,209
better pilot perhaps one played by Tom

92
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:48,130
Hanks and experienced in water landings

93
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:49,120
probably could have saved more lives

94
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,730
here like a situation needed more

95
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:54,430
urgency now the spinning jet engine is

96
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,329
gonna chew him up

97
00:02:55,329 --> 00:02:57,489
rotten Tommy I'm surprised a Megalodon

98
00:02:57,489 --> 00:02:58,870
doesn't eat him before he makes it to

99
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,579
the island not only just Chuck survived

100
00:03:00,579 --> 00:03:02,319
a plane crash into the ocean and this

101
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,030
engine explosion but also survives a

102
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,890
freaking monsoon and this raft good

103
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,239
thing we saw his sailing trophies and a

104
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:08,709
picture of him on a bike earlier because

105
00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:10,299
I was having my doubts about this until

106
00:03:10,299 --> 00:03:11,680
I remembered that honestly this looks

107
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,720
bad I know but after Forrest Gump Joe

108
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,560
versus the volcano

109
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,329
captain Phillips and Cloud Atlas these

110
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:17,829
right here are only the fifth roughest

111
00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:19,750
seas Tom Hanks has ever faced look if

112
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,040
you cut out the opening and the ending

113
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,420
of this movie and make it just about his

114
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,430
time on the island I love this movie but

115
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:25,750
later on he's gonna do the math on how

116
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,489
unlikely it is anyone will find them

117
00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:28,780
because of the size of the search area

118
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,489
and I can't help but apply that same

119
00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:32,079
logic back to the fact that somehow he

120
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:34,150
managed to drift unconscious onto an

121
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,440
island that appears to be the size of an

122
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,690
amusement park yes yes oosoos pedals are

123
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:38,980
stymie and Helen Hunt's watch is still

124
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,870
there somehow one of the thing this

125
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,730
movie does extremely well is long takes

126
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,680
often with a stationary camera I mean

127
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,180
how many filmmakers have the balls to do

128
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,980
it doesn't shock like this the answer is

129
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,239
however many directors have worked with

130
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:50,709
Tom Hanks in his prime and know to trust

131
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:52,389
him but I'm still removing a sin for the

132
00:03:52,389 --> 00:03:54,190
directorial restraint okay this

133
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,720
motherfucker came in with the time and

134
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,430
is a super trained sailor and knows

135
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,840
better than to draw this message here

136
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,310
but the movie was so desperate for a

137
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,930
tide washes hopeful a sight gag it

138
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:03,970
temporarily made him stupid I mean just

139
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,530
look at his stupid ass here he knew

140
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:07,239
enough about tides to put his raft and

141
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:09,160
the FedEx boxes up on that next tide

142
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,989
free level back there but not enough to

143
00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:12,519
draw this message elsewhere things this

144
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:13,690
movie either doesn't address or just

145
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:14,799
utterly glosses over

146
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,389
potable water and how long a person can

147
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:17,650
go without potable water I mean

148
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:19,840
seriously you cannot take salt water and

149
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,220
boil it to make it drinkable all this

150
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,930
dudes drinkable water is coming in rain

151
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,909
on leaf variety which we see him do once

152
00:04:24,909 --> 00:04:26,440
or twice in total and how reliably

153
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,639
consistent can that be

154
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:28,780
my ultimate point is that this movie

155
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:30,219
seemed to super gloss over the whole

156
00:04:30,219 --> 00:04:33,669
fresh water concern extremely smart

157
00:04:33,669 --> 00:04:35,379
person takes entirely too long to work

158
00:04:35,379 --> 00:04:36,789
through the obvious coconut answer to

159
00:04:36,789 --> 00:04:40,270
his audio riddle look I love Tom Hanks

160
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:42,460
you love Tom Hanks the whole world loves

161
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,169
Tom Hanks but hearing him shouting to

162
00:04:44,169 --> 00:04:45,520
avoid like Jerry Lewis and the Nutty

163
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,330
Professor really gets on the nerves fast

164
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,650
nothing says FedEx company man like a

165
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:52,300
guy who just crash-landed into the ocean

166
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,830
and floated to a deserted island on a

167
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,629
raft like I'm gonna pretend like this is

168
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:56,979
my sorting table and then I'm still on

169
00:04:56,979 --> 00:04:58,419
the clock it's like the realization that

170
00:04:58,419 --> 00:04:59,860
the coconuts are the noise he's been

171
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,419
hearing triggers the first indication

172
00:05:01,419 --> 00:05:02,889
for him that he is both starving and

173
00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:04,599
thirsty as and that's a little weird

174
00:05:04,599 --> 00:05:05,919
he's been more worried about collecting

175
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,509
packages the tide brings in than any of

176
00:05:07,509 --> 00:05:09,279
his human needs the balls on this guy

177
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:10,750
bringing this many back before even

178
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,009
knowing how he's gonna break into them

179
00:05:12,009 --> 00:05:13,599
wait wait I should have started with the

180
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,189
coconuts on this guy can we do another

181
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:16,990
tape of all the ways to first attempt to

182
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:19,000
break open a wild coconut this guy goes

183
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,860
with the Nolan Ryan method goddamn

184
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,779
mother nature did you maybe overdo it on

185
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:23,740
the coconut security

186
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,300
he seems really surprised to find a cave

187
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,770
on the island he hasn't even begun to

188
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:28,779
explore prior to now FedEx is now

189
00:05:28,779 --> 00:05:30,009
statistically more reliable at

190
00:05:30,009 --> 00:05:31,509
delivering packages from that plane to

191
00:05:31,509 --> 00:05:33,099
this island but it is delivering I

192
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:34,839
bought on eBay to my front door movie

193
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:36,490
yada-yada is over an awful lot of rock

194
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:38,560
climbing Celia you mean to tell me this

195
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,569
guy didn't carry any cash on him I mean

196
00:05:40,569 --> 00:05:42,789
yeah Jamie's dead though dude love is

197
00:05:42,789 --> 00:05:44,830
great but you can love the asite during

198
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,300
the day don't waste your limited

199
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,129
flashlight on every other second glances

200
00:05:48,129 --> 00:05:49,629
at your girlfriend's picture Jesus

201
00:05:49,629 --> 00:05:51,490
sometimes like you want to dock sigh

202
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,349
this island survival movie that ignores

203
00:05:53,349 --> 00:05:54,699
a lot of the questions I have does

204
00:05:54,699 --> 00:05:56,649
answer the one question we all have yes

205
00:05:56,649 --> 00:05:58,689
he poops and he kicks sand on it like my

206
00:05:58,689 --> 00:06:00,250
orange tabby and what is it about Tom

207
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,990
Hanks and peeing in movies he does this

208
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:02,830
all the time

209
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,479
Forrest Gump Green Mile a league of

210
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,490
their own Apollo 13 Toy Story the man

211
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:07,569
must have gotten tired of movies not

212
00:06:07,569 --> 00:06:08,979
addressing whether or not people pee and

213
00:06:08,979 --> 00:06:10,810
decided I'm going to write a terrible

214
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:12,610
wrong with my acting career again the

215
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:14,050
movie deliberately showed me a glory

216
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:15,759
shelf of his sailing accolades so the

217
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,289
idea that he would think this half-assed

218
00:06:17,289 --> 00:06:19,000
without a sail could ever work is just

219
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,439
an excuse to bloat the run time looks

220
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:22,270
painful like way more painful than not

221
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,500
ever having gone out there on a half

222
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,879
deflated raft in the first place

223
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:26,199
sorry if I'm having trouble finding my

224
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:27,580
pity he's drinking that chocolate milk

225
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,409
cave pond water and if you don't vomit

226
00:06:29,409 --> 00:06:31,330
or at least gag a bit you're not human

227
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:35,139
this is wrong it's out you don't say you

228
00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:36,339
are a jackass

229
00:06:36,339 --> 00:06:38,259
Chuck exposes his gnarly infected leg

230
00:06:38,259 --> 00:06:39,669
which never factors into this movie

231
00:06:39,669 --> 00:06:41,580
again also

232
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,750
this seems to be a legal document but

233
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,070
the middle paragraph of these divorce

234
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,930
papers indicate that the law firm of

235
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:48,970
mastic and godson is almost like the mom

236
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:50,800
because it says we have ways and

237
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,850
measures of getting a hold of you

238
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:53,620
wherever you go I have a feeling they

239
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,940
leave that out in the advertisements

240
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,560
make all the jokes you want to but this

241
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,180
is exactly how Scott Hamilton found his

242
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,860
calling Chuck decides not to open this

243
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,750
one probably as a symbol that even when

244
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:02,920
things are at their worst he can still

245
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,690
keep some sort of moral compass but man

246
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:05,890
well if this thing has something he

247
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:07,570
could really use I don't move 50 sins if

248
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:08,770
we found out that the box contained a

249
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:11,110
raft a radio nautical maps signal flares

250
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:13,210
and add just one drop of water food and

251
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:14,770
and yes I know that's impossible for a

252
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:16,419
package the size but what the hell man

253
00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:18,190
like most naked and afraid contestants

254
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,390
eventually a producer came in with a

255
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:21,190
Zippo and lit dish and then the cameras

256
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,330
started rolling to make it look like he

257
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:23,800
finally started the fire with this bow

258
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,080
drill free wow what a neat bloody

259
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,250
handprint that could not have happened

260
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,169
when Chuck grabbed this volleyball also

261
00:07:29,169 --> 00:07:30,550
let's not forget Chuck grabbed the ball

262
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,410
with his fingers pointed toward the AVP

263
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,480
letters in this shot but now they point

264
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,130
away from them in this shot could the

265
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:37,840
ball have rotated when he threw it maybe

266
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,610
but I'm sitting it anyway the Wilson

267
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,500
character ends up being super crucial to

268
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,240
this emotional journey just imagine if

269
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,100
they used another brand like Spaulding

270
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,320
or Rawlings or Moulton or touch acara

271
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,210
just wouldn't have that same sad ring if

272
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:50,470
hanks were tearfully screaming out

273
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:58,240
Rawlings good god how can you not take a

274
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,110
sin off for this

275
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:01,330
look how joy this brings him she's much

276
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:02,979
prettier in real life

277
00:08:02,979 --> 00:08:04,330
looks like the National Soccer Hall of

278
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:05,860
Fame enlisted Chuck to draw the image of

279
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,660
Brandi Chastain on her plaque the scene

280
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:08,979
was cut from the dentist because it was

281
00:08:08,979 --> 00:08:10,390
too graphic I wished the movie I'm

282
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,950
referring to had a more subtle name but

283
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:15,970
it's the dentist only a lot of time

284
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:17,620
must've went by like enough time to

285
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:20,110
shoot what lies beneath also view movie

286
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:21,280
I don't care all awesome he got it

287
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,600
spearfishing that motherfucker can't

288
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,760
even see this fish from all the way over

289
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,169
there Chuck shows faith in the tape

290
00:08:26,169 --> 00:08:28,030
inside a VHS cassette to keep his raft

291
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:31,680
intact I know I know

292
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,550
character in a movie he says he's not

293
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:35,140
gonna do a thing only to be doing that

294
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,520
exact thing in the next shock leash it

295
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,380
also wasn't he making rope out of the

296
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,820
plants on the island so are those

297
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,770
completely gone not entirely sure why he

298
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:42,820
needs to risk his life for this

299
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,110
particular rope really it just seems

300
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:45,310
like the movie needed a way to tell us

301
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:46,870
that he contemplated suicide and didn't

302
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,520
go through with it look the film is just

303
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,720
a few minutes away from the ultimate

304
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,670
Wilson emotional gut punch I honestly

305
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,170
think this faked out Wilson emotional

306
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:54,250
gut punch under my

307
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,630
it's the real one coming later rather

308
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:57,790
than adding to or building to it also if

309
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:58,840
you're on this island and reading this

310
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,400
message haha you're on a deserted island

311
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,440
you I could give you instructions on how

312
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,940
to build a fire but I'd much rather just

313
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,140
tell you how much I love the girlfriend

314
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,730
I left behind whatever Island materially

315
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:08,260
he used to paint this giant version of

316
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,670
the angel wings doodle he finds so

317
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:11,200
fascinating and precious they should

318
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,460
damn well have been removed at this

319
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,660
point by saltwater and torrential

320
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,490
downpour he did not have the all-weather

321
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:17,020
bear collection at his disposal when

322
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,880
painting this it's not an I almost died

323
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,260
at sea movie if there isn't a friendly

324
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:23,530
whale visit all that storms waves in

325
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,420
this movie is so much of a mother but

326
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,740
what ultimately separates him from

327
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,910
Wilson will be an after-the-fact

328
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:32,170
harmless wave this movie just made me

329
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:34,510
cry over a volleyball a volleyball

330
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:37,000
doesn't that deserve a sit off no no it

331
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,220
doesn't but here's a sin off anyway no

332
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,750
one probably cares about probabilities

333
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,520
at this point except me but the odds of

334
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,930
him being discovered at sea aren't any

335
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:48,250
better than him being discovered on that

336
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,990
Island sure you're gonna tell me that by

337
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,430
leaving he ended up in a shipping lane

338
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:53,290
that many cargo ships use and got

339
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:55,210
himself seen and fine but my reply is

340
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:56,560
more about how many times he should have

341
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,480
died on that Homer Simpson ramp before

342
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,400
reaching the shipping lane this movie

343
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,390
gives the middle finger to math

344
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:04,570
basically also we are now done with the

345
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:05,890
survival portion of the movie in the

346
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:07,780
final 35 minutes will be about how weird

347
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,160
it is that the mad about you girlfriend

348
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,589
has married mr. big but why what took

349
00:10:11,589 --> 00:10:12,280
for weeks

350
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,510
surely something dramatic and

351
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:14,860
enthralling happened when that boat

352
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:15,970
found Chuck and took him back to

353
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:17,560
civilization why wouldn't we want to see

354
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,089
that we buried you

355
00:10:19,089 --> 00:10:21,790
I had a funeral and a coffin gravestone

356
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:24,339
you know what I rarely send trailers but

357
00:10:24,339 --> 00:10:25,660
this exact scene was in the fucking

358
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,490
trailer the trailer told you that he was

359
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:28,600
definitely going to get off the island

360
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,550
sure you knew in your heart he would get

361
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:32,080
off the island anyway but it just makes

362
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,580
it a little less satisfying to go along

363
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,800
on the journey so you had my funeral and

364
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,530
then you had Mary's you know there it is

365
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:40,780
folks that's sweet yet sour payoff from

366
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,280
the my wife is dying foreshadowing

367
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,380
earlier on with the Scott I mean this

368
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,910
movie needs all the punches in the gut

369
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,860
it can get right because the baseline

370
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,720
story here is so vanilla I'm Kelly's

371
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,290
husband

372
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:52,180
she's weak doubt naturally so instead of

373
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,920
coming here herself she sent the guy she

374
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,710
married after you died the why didn't

375
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:58,180
she send a lawyer or a sibling or a

376
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:00,160
college friend of all the people to ask

377
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,200
to explain to it you chose your current

378
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,550
as husband

379
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,620
this is very hard night and for everyone

380
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,850
honestly I feel like this movie should

381
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:08,110
either be trying to explore the crash

382
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:10,269
survivor island life or the what happens

383
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:11,740
when I come back from surviving and my

384
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,060
girlfriend married someone else in her

385
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,620
personal impact of such an experience

386
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,870
but not both alas the movie goes for

387
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:26,860
both this guy on the first day back to

388
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,480
the mainland after four years of Island

389
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,279
survival everyone just leaves him alone

390
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:32,829
in a hotel room somehow his mental

391
00:11:32,829 --> 00:11:34,630
health was entirely ignored and everyone

392
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:35,860
just assumes he can process everything

393
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,540
fine and will be up at dawn tomorrow

394
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,070
ready for all the interviews like he's

395
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:40,810
George Clooney and not someone just

396
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:43,950
emerging from four years of major trauma

397
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:46,149
about ten minutes ten minutes with the

398
00:11:46,149 --> 00:11:47,380
girlfriend who thought I was dead for

399
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,760
four years and married while I was gone

400
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,560
should be just enough time for me also I

401
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,480
got to admire this cab driver Chuck is

402
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,829
famous right now and has been through a

403
00:11:53,829 --> 00:11:55,779
lot but he can't spare any time for this

404
00:11:55,779 --> 00:11:56,110
guy

405
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:57,760
hey man Memphis at this hour is a hotbed

406
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,709
of cab activity right now dude I need to

407
00:11:59,709 --> 00:12:00,970
be free to earn that sweet sweet

408
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,440
weeknight at 1:00 in the morning met

409
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,329
this cab fare thankfully his impulsive

410
00:12:04,329 --> 00:12:05,440
late-night visit to his ex-girlfriend's

411
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,029
house comes at a time when the kids are

412
00:12:07,029 --> 00:12:08,440
asleep and the husband's conveniently

413
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,209
gone and it's raining so she has to

414
00:12:10,209 --> 00:12:12,190
invite him in Houston Oilers are the

415
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,870
Tennessee Titans they went to the Super

416
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:16,060
Bowl last year they almost won by one

417
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,370
yard one lousy yard right at the end

418
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,779
yeah about that

419
00:12:19,779 --> 00:12:21,279
thanks for crushing my soul again but

420
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,959
the one yard was a chance to get within

421
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,820
one point and then hope something weird

422
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,290
didn't happen with Al Del Greco on the

423
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:28,209
after point then over time who knows

424
00:12:28,209 --> 00:12:30,010
what would happen to overtime but stop

425
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:31,600
with the we would have one narrative can

426
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:37,270
I Drive it car taxi he didn't even wait

427
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,770
the 10 minutes Chuck found the least

428
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:40,420
sympathetic cab driver in the world

429
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,950
he didn't give two fucks about this dude

430
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:43,839
it's hilarious and I'm sitting it anyway

431
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,370
because the sin counts probably pretty

432
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:48,160
low sudden vehicular gift is sudden you

433
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,870
were dead for a long time what a cheap

434
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,670
maybe make up for it a bit I can't give

435
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:55,029
you my vagina I'm afraid I know that she

436
00:12:55,029 --> 00:12:56,560
told Chuck that this was still his car

437
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,940
but she and her husband have been using

438
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:00,100
it as a second car now tomorrow mr. big

439
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,540
is gonna wake up and see that the family

440
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,800
has to use one car without being

441
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,630
consulted if Chuck can wait a few months

442
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:06,279
Kelly will be available again in no time

443
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:09,310
oh come on he did not see her and

444
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:10,720
definitely did not hear her in this rain

445
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,459
this kiss while realistic from her

446
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:13,990
perspective she thought he was dead of

447
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:15,490
course she still loves him ends up

448
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:16,779
symbolizing everything I hate about this

449
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:17,379
movie

450
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:18,849
which is that his survival becomes all

451
00:13:18,849 --> 00:13:20,619
about his love for her then they neuter

452
00:13:20,619 --> 00:13:23,049
it by giving her a new husband life fine

453
00:13:23,049 --> 00:13:24,939
but this is no longer story deserving of

454
00:13:24,939 --> 00:13:27,459
film treatment he ends up sadist like me

455
00:13:27,459 --> 00:13:28,880
I hate you

456
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,720
[Music]

457
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,069
Chuck likes to play songs that are apt

458
00:13:33,069 --> 00:13:34,479
to the situation and luckily his

459
00:13:34,479 --> 00:13:36,099
favorite artist Elvis Presley did a song

460
00:13:36,099 --> 00:13:37,929
called return to sender which is perfect

461
00:13:37,929 --> 00:13:39,309
for what he's currently doing well it

462
00:13:39,309 --> 00:13:41,079
appears that Betina kept this science

463
00:13:41,079 --> 00:13:42,549
dick off Chuck his little literal

464
00:13:42,549 --> 00:13:44,199
crossroads in his life and I appreciate

465
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:45,579
the heavy-handed symbolism but dude

466
00:13:45,579 --> 00:13:47,229
seriously go wherever this woman is

467
00:13:47,229 --> 00:13:49,659
going is there even really a choice he

468
00:13:49,659 --> 00:13:51,129
does look in that direction at the end

469
00:13:51,129 --> 00:13:52,839
but he should already be in his car for

470
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:54,549
the record this is a long ass movie but

471
00:13:54,549 --> 00:13:56,049
it's still shorter than Star Wars the

472
00:13:56,049 --> 00:14:18,039
last Jedi sack is motivated to prove he

473
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:20,679
can survive the 21 days his overall lack

474
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:23,139
of experience in an unforgiving tropical

475
00:14:23,139 --> 00:14:25,239
environment may hurt him Zack begins

476
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:34,559
with a PSR of 6.8 la

477
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:38,799
87 hours is a shameful outrage this is

478
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:42,909
just you are a sad strange little man

479
00:14:42,909 --> 00:14:45,220
and you have my pity he died of

480
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:48,159
dysentery give me the watch I hit this

481
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:49,899
uncomfortable hunk of metal up my ass

482
00:14:49,899 --> 00:14:55,019
two years

483
00:14:55,019 --> 00:15:05,500
hello anybody oh wow got coral right

484
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,000
there in your leg
