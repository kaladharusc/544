1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,970
hey guys angry Joe another Joe here so

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:05,069
as you know July and August a little bit

3
00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:07,379
of a Down month for video games not a

4
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:10,170
whole lot is coming out but there's

5
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:11,519
there's some things here and there

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,200
however there was one game that I really

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,230
wanted to do a video on I had met the

8
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,150
developer in person before and I was

9
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:19,350
like yeah man I can't wait to play your

10
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,020
game which is sort of like this you know

11
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:27,890
robot game and you know I like robot

12
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:31,230
yeah so me and Joe played this on stream

13
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,899
and I did something different I wanted

14
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:37,800
Joe to take command watch me and in all

15
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,829
my glory if you want to call it that

16
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:44,460
without any help so here is a strategy

17
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,890
newbie without any help it is hilarious

18
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:49,980
and he takes a mission and then I think

19
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,750
I take a mission later on in the video

20
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,480
so into the breach let's play it's a

21
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,829
pretty cool game it's probably on

22
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:58,829
discount by now so definitely give it a

23
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:00,480
look if it looks like it's something fun

24
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,640
for you but it's all about men maxing

25
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,080
that turn and you come up with these

26
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,320
creative combinations to really get

27
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,299
everything you can out of your turn so

28
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:11,220
alright guys check it out and hope you

29
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:19,080
guys enjoy all right I don't want to see

30
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,560
a single building destroyed nobody

31
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,229
nobody destroyed so remember the tank

32
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:27,930
only fires in a straight line alright

33
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:30,900
but it can move too so and then there's

34
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,680
the artillery let's put here

35
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,060
artillery no no undo how do you undo

36
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:45,509

166
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:22,650
that you can start start a new game a

167
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:25,290
new game knowing all those tactics and

168
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:27,210
knowing that you can you want to shoot

169
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:28,950
your own mechs when it's required you

170
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,960
want to heal your Mac's when it's

171
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:37,370
required

172
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:50,700
fire oh my god we did it

173
00:13:50,700 --> 00:14:00,680
I saved people and I got promoted

174
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:04,620
they say overall pretty good day I did

175
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:09,300
it too for so Joel all right you're

176
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,710
figuring it now

177
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:13,770
like see I'm getting better I see more

178
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:14,700
practice

179
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,640
was it fun it was actually I liked the

180
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,740
music in the art style that there yeah I

181
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,540
thought you know you know obviously

182
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,070
people disappointed maybe a little bit

183
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,839
cuz it's not FTL too but man he was

184
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:27,029
burned out on FTL - I'm glad he did

185
00:14:27,029 --> 00:14:29,190
something different and this at first I

186
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:30,960
was like ah it's too simple it's it's

187
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,550
not gonna be enough you only have two

188
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:34,529
actions two weapons one weapon on some

189
00:14:34,529 --> 00:14:38,190
things but actually you know it becomes

190
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:39,540
sort of like this little puzzle that

191
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,460
you're unfold yeah it's very simple but

192
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:43,170
there's so many options you could do and

193
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:45,150
you get into that zone and you figure it

194
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,830
out there's there's usually almost

195
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,810
always a way out sometimes you're gonna

196
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:50,160
have to take some damage so there is a

197
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,400
reset button that helped me out oh yeah

198
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,800
so don't use it too much all right so

199
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,360
