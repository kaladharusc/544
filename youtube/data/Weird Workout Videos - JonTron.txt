all right maybe he's got a bit of a

35
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,250
point perhaps I'm not in the kind of

36
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,500
shape I thought I was in so I've decided

37
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,659
to watch some workout tapes to try and

38
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:36,130
shed some of the weight speaking of

39
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:37,750
workout videos I always thought these

40
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:40,119
things were so weird whoever actually

41
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:42,520
used one of these even the relatively

42
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,080
normal ones seemed like the work of

43
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,090
lunatics you always see it in movies and

44
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:47,350
stuff but I don't know a single person

45
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:49,360
who's actually used one of these hey

46
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,619
they must have sold at one point

47
00:01:50,619 --> 00:01:51,759
otherwise they wouldn't have made so

48
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,409
many today we're gonna be reviewing some

49
00:01:53,409 --> 00:01:55,060

50
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,429
find out there because hey go big or go

51

58
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,319
nonviolent

59
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,600
it's about conservation it's about three

60
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,530
things that I don't know how they're

61
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,180
related to each other or related to

62
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,640
exercise or horses so in their own words

63
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,370
prancercise registered is defined as a

64
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:25,310
springy rhythmic way of moving forward

65
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:28,160
similar to a horse's gait this form of

66
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,230
movement along with dietary and

67
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,330
spiritual principles can create the most

68
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:35,060
satisfying holistic and successful

69
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,130
