9
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,130
using these same pair of headphones

10
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:19,560
since I started YouTube and I finally

11
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,090
decided to upgrade him but the folks

12
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:22,800
over at a mass drop sent me a large

13
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,900
variety of headphones and honestly I

14
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,449
really like the way these look but oh my

15
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:29,460

19
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,489
filming and editing but I had no clue

20
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:37,680
how much better music would sound I had

21
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,690
no clue how much better gaming would

22
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:41,579
sound until I put these on I mean if you

hiding back there and you never believe

109
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:19,770
what's going on right now if you've been

110
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:21,150
keeping up with a drama over there on

111
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:23,250
Jesse's Channel

112
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:28,330
Swift is trying to get his job back I'll

113
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:29,410
link to that video if you guys want to

115
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,960
flow I get enough

116
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,280
drone footage to make his save his job

117
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:42,460
we're gonna see alright guys it's time

118
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,530
to have a tough conversation we've been

119
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:45,759
sitting around this little picnic table

120
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,199
in Jesse's spacious we're talking a lot

121
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:51,820
about story fire and if you guys have

122
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,400
seen story fire I'd really hope you'll

123
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,449
download the app I've written some

124
00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:56,710
stories up there there's some Francis

125
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:58,539
sketches and stuff and and Jessi is now

126
00:04:58,539 --> 00:05:01,150
adding video to the platform and we've

127
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:02,289
been talking about a really tough

128
00:05:02,289 --> 00:05:04,720
decision because if you know me if you

129
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,639
know Jessie if you know kid behind the

130
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,560
camera you know that our videos are not

131
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,389
performing the way they used to we know

132
00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:12,789
that you love them as much as you've

133
00:05:12,789 --> 00:05:14,830
ever loved them and I think I made a

134
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,300
decision talking to these guys tonight

135
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:20,199
that we will be creating not just maybe

136
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:23,349
an old archive of Francis sketches to

137
00:05:23,349 --> 00:05:25,509
put on the platform so that you guys can

138
00:05:25,509 --> 00:05:28,389
see it there without having to try to

139
00:05:28,389 --> 00:05:30,099
die through YouTube's algorithm and try

140
00:05:30,099 --> 00:05:31,840
to dive through my channel to all the

141
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,190
other videos have uploaded you just get

142
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,590
the best of Francis there but then maybe

143
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:37,570
even early release of the Francis

144
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:41,229
Friday's video or even custom content

145
00:05:41,229 --> 00:05:44,199
for story fire and the point behind that

146
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:45,639
would be what was that you're telling me

147
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:47,080
at dinner what would be the advantage of

148
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,270
me creating a video not for YouTube but

149
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,949
for you on story fire so a few things

150
00:05:50,949 --> 00:05:53,229
that make Storify better from a creator

151
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:54,159
perspective

152
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:57,159
Louie's gonna get 100% of the revenue

153
00:05:57,159 --> 00:05:59,680
for all you guys creating YouTube takes

154
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,810
45 percent right off the bat they made

155
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:04,180
3.4 billion dollars this year and don't

156
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,949
give a freak about giving the creator's

157
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:07,599
more percentage and that's the other

158
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:09,280
thing right there what did you just have

159
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,360
to say because you're on YouTube you

160
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,190
have to say freak free I can't even

161
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:14,050
courage so Boogie suddenly can be

162
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:16,630
himself he concurs what about Francis

163
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:18,849
who's every third word it's a swear word

164
00:06:18,849 --> 00:06:21,849
that gets pushed out of the algorithm

165
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:23,770
now Jesse Cox was complaining on Twitter

166
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:26,590
today saying that his last name is Co X

167
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:28,870
and that is getting his videos not

168
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:31,330
recommended because it sounds like a

169
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:32,169
swear word

170
00:06:32,169 --> 00:06:34,419
one story fire that's not something

171
00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:35,040
you'd have to worry

172
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,570
you'll always be able to see my videos

173
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:39,180
and I think as soon as you see this

174
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,280
there's probably gonna be videos already

175
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,050
only have an archive and we'll start

176
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:45,300
doing classic Francis sketches with the

177
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,100
swearing with the destruction with

178
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,050
tearing up a house a car whatever it

179
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:51,030
takes and I want to know what you guys

180
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:52,170
think so you have to tell me in the

181
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:54,050
comment section below

182
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:56,760
it might just be the future of video

183
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,470
creation I want to all I want to hear

184

187
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,570
to pose the question to you guys what is

188
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:07,890
wrong with YouTube from the user

189
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:10,080
perspective what would you guys love to

190
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,300
see with a new video app what kind of

191
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,950
content do you feel like should be

192
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,990
pushed on the app recommend it I just

193
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,040
want to hear your thoughts if you were

194
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,320
creating your own video platform what

195
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,700
would you want to see what would you

196
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,380
what do you think should be done and

197
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,300
guys we want you to be a part of that

198
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,410
community want to build this fire

199
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:27,720
together and not just be some corporate

200
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,430
name and a logo that you can never have

201
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:32,910
any communication with amen and let me

202
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,170
make you one more promise I will always

203
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:35,820
have no videos to YouTube you'll always

204
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,230
be able to watch the stuff I create on

205
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:38,490
YouTube even if I put something

206
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,680
exclusive on storey fire we've already

207
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,180
agreed that'll eventually end up on

208
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,890
YouTube I don't think you'll be able to

209
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:45,060
find it because of the way the algorithm

210
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,860
works anymore but as long as you're

211
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:47,940
still watching me in YouTube you'll

212
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,410
always be able to watch my content there

213
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:51,750
but if you want to watch it earlier and

214
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,800
you want to encourage me to create

215
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,480
better content with the France and stuff

216
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,580
you're gonna download story fart and

217
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:59,040
guarantee to you guys from a creator

218
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,590
thing to boogie uploads the story far

219
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:02,880
he's gonna get not only pushed by the

220
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,910
platform itself but guess what all his

221
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:09,510
subscribers get notified 100% there's no

222
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:11,940

even have to say that guys and look I

224
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:16,470
know the users and the fans they like to

225
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:17,910
criticize youtubers for complaining

226
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:19,080
about you - like you're in such a

227
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,640
privileged ocean you make so much money

228
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:24,450
to understand that we work for Google in

229
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:26,370
essence we are their slaves we are in

230
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:28,470
the hamster wheel we're the rats so we

231

have every right to complain and we see

232
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:31,650
something that's going wrong just as

233
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:32,880
much as your parents might complain

234
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,520
about government or taxes or whatever we

235
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,650
are seeing it firsthand and trust me

236
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,810
from the user side you guys are gonna

237
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:42,540
feel the ramifications if not now in the

238
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:43,169
near future

239
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:45,020
so it's time to jump ship and joy

honest when you said you wanted to do

253
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:18,770
the interview I thought it was just

254
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:20,360
knowing about weight loss and stuff and

255
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,280
I did not know he's good he asked

256
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,440
questions about abuse about clickbait

257
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,830
about lies about racism about everything

258
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,570
because I read your comments and I

259
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,190

261
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,820

262
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:35,420

263
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:38,660
