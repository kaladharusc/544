teapot and break out the two stops is

56
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:20,180

57
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,850
this world grosser than a porta potty on

58

61
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:43,940

[Music]

64
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:58,040
covering there's the starting line they

65
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,069
cook has a hand cyclist go first and do

66
00:04:01,069 --> 00:04:04,069
a couple minutes and then they like use

67
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:05,840
the gun of the candidate and we take off

68
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,150
we're pretty close to the front but not

69
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,830
right at the front because that's where

70
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:11,750
the really bad guys are you can keep

71
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,180
your license off you'll enjoy the race

72
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,760
are there any advice for me can go out

73
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,670

finish line

87
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,190
the first 500 feet are pure excitement

88
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:09,950
it's finally begun you find your pace

89
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:13,460
you're psyched first mile marker 11 more

90
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:17,000
10 more 9 words starting to hurt you

91
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,260
feel some pains that weren't there

92
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,120
before but you're fine you're settled in

93
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,830
you're thinking to yourself if I can

94
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,450
maintain this the whole way through I'm

95
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:25,280
going to break my personal record this

96
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,770
will be the best race I've ever had 8

97
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:31,040
miles left 7 motto flip six miles left

98
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,740
piece of cake I got this a 10k away from

99
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,810
the finish line then the pain really

100
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:37,580
kicked in and it's not just your legs

101
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,350
you're not just tired lungs don't just

102
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:40,460
hurt your head doesn't just hurt

103
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:43,970
everything earth for miles left things

104
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:46,160
are getting really hard you passed a 10

105
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,380
mile marker there's only a 5k won five

106
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,030
of those you need to take but now you're

107
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:51,890
fighting you're going ten seconds slower

108
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:53,870
per mile and then the doubt comes in

109
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:56,030
maybe I'll just trip and fall I want to

110
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,320
finish but at least I'll have a good

111
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,260
excuse other than finishing slow maybe

112
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,090
just a 30-second break to take a piss

113
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:04,910
but one mile left but that last mile

114
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:07,070
this last mile this is the worst this

115
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:09,290
last mile is harder than all 12 miles

116
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:12,770
before it I will get across that finish

117
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:14,000
line
