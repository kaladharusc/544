00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:03,140
&lt;?&gt;

3
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,480
Meme Review.

4
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:07,920
Youtube's favorite show, everybody.

5
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,060
meme review.

6
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:10,520
&lt;?&gt; Clap it up &lt;?&gt;, everybody &lt;?&gt;.

7
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,300
It's time for another episode.

8
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,880
What is he going to say about memes this week?

9
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,040
I don't know  it's so exciting.

10
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,780
Yes, it is!

11
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:19,560
Thank you.

12
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,000
Unfortunately, I have terrible news.&lt;chuckles&gt;

13
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,720
&lt;queue sad piano music&gt;

14
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm gonna give you guys a warning.

15
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,500
To click away this video.

16
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,160
Right now.

17
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,520
I know you're not gonna though.

18
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,200
Slimey little scumbaggy.

19
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,940
Like you've got anything better to do?

20
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,620
I know why you clicked on this.

21
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:35,240
That's why I called you slimey.

22
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,440
I know that you know,

23
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,720
That I already know,

24
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:38,800
That you know.

25
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,440
Okay?

26
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,540
You're just here for some Bowsette

27
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:42,040
Aren't you?

28
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:42,880
Ew!

29
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:43,620
Nasty!

30
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:44,860
I like that though.

31
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:46,000
I like that. (☭ ͜ʖ ☭)

32
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,360
Bowsette.

33
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,380
#Bowsette.

34
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,200
It's taken over the world.

35
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,880
It's taken over the planet.

36
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,060
It's taken over the universe.

37
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:59,080
When our planet will cease to exist , one thing that will keep on living

38
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,960
is Bowsette.

39
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,900
Aliens will find scatters (Fragments?)
of our artifacts and it will be written upon it:

40
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,480
Bowsette

41
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,060
And that's all we really need to transpire..

42
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:11,540
Across the universe.

43
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:13,740
Hail the Queen Bowsette.

44
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,980
What is Bowsette?

45
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,880
Yes ofcourse, it's in the name.

46
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,020
It's the female version of Bowser.

47
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:22,400
we have officially done it, bois

48
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,920
The #Bowsette was trending worldwide in
Japan!

49
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,620
Bowsette has been on... has been going on for a while.

50
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:32,680
But this is the tweet
that started it all.

51
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,340
by HaniWAH

52
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:35,080
It's a wedding.

53
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,700
Peach says: NO

54
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,000
Mario is super SAD

55
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,100
Bowser is super SAD

56
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,560
But then they look
at each other..

57
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,300
and

58
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,020
OH

59
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:45,740
MY

60
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,140
GAAAAWD

61
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,220
Bowser became Bowsette

62
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:49,740
and they

63
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,380
SMASHED

64
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,780
I added
the last part.

65
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,320
Sorry.

66
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,860
I love I ...This Is It

67
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,080
This is all it takes to
break the internet.

68
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,700
People posted this hashtag, I mean...

69
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:04,380
You can't go online
without seeing Bowsette somewhere

70
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,260
You just can't.

71
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:08,980
Did Bowser lose weight?

72
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:10,520
Is it hot in here?

73
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,120
Or is it just me?

74
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,400
Cause Bowsette is looking very attractive

75
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,160
Sorry, Marzia.

76
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,500
I just feel like I , I wanna be honest

77
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:25,120
&lt;Mr. Miyamoto&gt; : So how are the
fans enjoying the upcoming game in the switch games?

78
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:31,520
&lt;Reggie&gt; : Everyone seems to be talking about NSMBU and the super crown

79
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,520
&lt;Mr. Miyamoto&gt; :
Ah yes, now the people can play as Peach

80
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,600
Hooray

81
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,340
Uhm..

82
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:43,540
&lt;Reggie&gt; : It seems they like its for a different reason..

83
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,340
Just look at Bowsette

84
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,040
Look what they did.

85
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,760
Look what they did, Mr. Miyamoto.

86
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,440
A close-up of my eyes?

87
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,160
Peach is screaming internally,

88
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,660
of all the  Bowsette fan fiction.

89
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:01,640
Besides, is there anyone that has a pencil and a paper has
decided,

90
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,160
YES ( ͡⚆ل͜ ͡⚆)

91
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,360
Yes, I am going to draw Bowsette.

92
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,340
What else am I going to do with my life?

93
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:09,720
I don't get it, like..

94
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,780
I feel like this whole thing is a sexy Phil clickbait title

95
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:16,300
People are freaking out over Bowser, and here's why..

96
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:19,780
I still don't get it...I still don't get it.

97
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:25,040
Hey look it's the Bongocatbowsette.

98
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,280
&lt;INAUDIBLE&gt;

99
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,200
At some point we have to just be
responsible

100
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,880
And say: &lt;???? &gt;   &lt;EXPLOSION&gt;

101
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:40,800
 

102
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,680
Perhaps we were all just ignorant.

103
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,880
Perhaps we were all just blind.

104
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:50,040
Bowsette has been in front of us since the very beginning.

105
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,370
anyway thing could be bow saying oh my

106
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:56,440
God..... I see it now.

107
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:00,580
Bowsette is incredibly
attractive!

108
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,120
How could I have been so blind?

109
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,260
Okay we definitely can't show this

110
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,500
&lt;LINK IN DESCRIPTION&gt;

111
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,840
Okay...

112
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,440
&lt;?&gt;

113
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:08,940
&lt;?&gt;

114
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,700
Obviously this meme is still blowing up

115
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,860
there's not really a much of important for me to rate it

116
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:18,960
But simply makes me
physically ill and attractive at the same time

117
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:19,460
&lt;?&gt;

118
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:19,960
&lt;?&gt;

119
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,980
I'm gonna have to give it a 5

120
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,580
It's a perfect balance meme

121
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:28,780
whoop

122
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,520
&lt;?&gt; NEXT

123
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,420
&lt;?&gt; MEME

124
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,920
Intermission is that
what it's called.

125
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,860
Just wanna point out.

126
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:38,260
Okay, Bongo cat still doing strong still
going strong everybody.

127
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:41,560
Bongo cat is doing great

128
00:04:41,560 --> 00:05:22,040
Thank you for asking.

129
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,890
So while you waste your time with stupid Bowsette

130
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:33,720
Just know there are positive sides out
there there are positive movements

131
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:38,760
This is not really much of a meme it's more
of a meme war that I feel I have to acknowledge

132
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:45,920
We got the m14 gang versus
the Olympia gang in black ops zombies

133
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,290
whatever it's called, I'm not a nerd I
don't play video games

134
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:50,700
I'm not some loser..

135
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,820
especially that plays
Call of Duty

136
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,740
&lt;baby pewds&gt; How's it going bros, my name is poodiepie &lt;baby pewds&gt;

137
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,800
Made by m14 gang

138
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,380
Imagine unironically using the m14

139
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,000
Made by Olympia gang

140
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Ouch!

141
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,900
That one's gotta really hurt.

142
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,340
We all know that the m14 is the superior

143
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:15,580
anyone that picks a shotgun in any video
game is just a moron that can't aim properly

144
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:18,700
&lt;Kids with an opinion&gt;

145
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,560
STUPID

146
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,340
The m14 takes skill

147
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,760
it takes accuracy and you know what

148
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,420
It doesn't matter when the dogs come yes
there will be bears technically superior

149
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:39,870
