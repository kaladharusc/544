00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:08,820
Only 20 minutes late, huh Greg? That's pretty impressive for your sorry a@#!

2
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,780
Hm, hm, hm, hm, hmMMM, your b@#$%y attitude is no match for me, Bridget!

3
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:18,400
Fool! I'm only using 30% of my b#&amp;&amp;%y attitude HAHAHAHAHA!

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:24,040
Ughhhh!

5
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,340
And that's how you skin a cat.

6
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,000
Clarissa, what did i tell you about sleeping in class?

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,380
(muffled) I'm not sleeping Mr.Stewart.

8
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,940
Excuse me?

9
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,260
I said, I am not sleeping Mr.Stewart!

10
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:36,740
I- I can't. Can you guys-

11
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:37,420
(Please)

12
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:39,420
(GASP)

13
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:40,280
Oh my GOD!

14
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,000
I haven't seen a persons face in like days!

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,920
These breasts are just way too big for the proportions of the rest of my body!

16
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,380
You know, as a male I would have to disagree.

17
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:49,340
Woah! woah! woah!

18
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:54,600
(Anime girl falls)

19
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,100
And now for the hundred meter dash!

20
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:06,009
Runners take your marks, get set, go!

21
00:01:06,009 --> 00:01:15,939
Running, like that doesn't help you at all but theeeyy, still keep doing it.

22
00:01:15,939 --> 00:01:20,740
Hey, uhh, I need to renew my license?

23
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:21,939
(sigh)

24
00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:26,440
So! You wish to renew your license in order to get back on the streets. Huh!?

25
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,680
Right you are sir, and I am in a bit of a hurry!

26
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,360
Well, well, well! Do you have the forms of which I speak in order to make this renewal official!?

27
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,760
Gaah! I forgot the form!

28
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,820
Well that's too bad cuz-

29
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,620
Wait...Uhh... I'm not I- I'm not stopping stopping.

30
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,660
C-c-can you help me? Help me out I'm not stopping!

31
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:44,640
WHY AM I NOT STOPPING!?

32
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:51,360
HEEEEEELP! HELP! HEEELP! PLEAAASE!? PLEAAAAASEEE!?

33
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:59,080
It's a peculiar thing, language, merely just sounds attempting to convey a common understanding between two similar yet entirely different entities.

34
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,710
Sounds, which can signify the utmost importance, bring

35
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:07,150
about such a permanence and change yet once uttered aloud, dissipate into the ether, never to be heard again!

36
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:10,320
Vanishing in the mere moment they're birthed! So how does one respond to such a question!?

37
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:19,280
Knowing that the answer consisting of sounds, so simple, so intangible, has the weight to bind my soul to another force for eternity!

38
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,500
I DO!

39
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,660
Why the hell did you freeze for like 10 minutes?

40
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:24,400
GAH!

41
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:32,200
Why did I freeze for like 10 minutes? Hmmmm (Anime noise)

42
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:36,160
MMM NUM NUM NUM NUM MMM MMM NUM NUM NUM NUM

43
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,940
Oh, uh hey. Uh Just a heads up-

44
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:40,280
I know you think you're eating really fast but you're

45
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:46,060
not actually eating anything at all, you're just rotating the same noodles back, and forth back in the bowl.

46
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,100
Oh...

47
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,480
Yeah.

48
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:55,680
Oh th-that's why I'm still hungry.

49
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,580
(muffled) WOOAAAH!

50
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:07,660
So she wanted him to take off his jacket but he, was like &quot;Babe!  Man's not hot!&quot; And then he's like-

51
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,940
(insert gushing sound here)

52
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,940
Dude! They're like 14 years old! (Tactical nosebleed, INCOMING!)

53
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,640
Huh?

54
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,440
Oh no! No! No! No! No! No!

55
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,320
I take it back! Take it back! take it back!

56
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,040
You're on your own dude...

57
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,340
But I take it back!

58
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:28,500
I take it back.

59
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:34,900
(sigh)

60
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:39,420
Alright. I guess I gotta... powerup!

61
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:42,440
AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!(alright off brand goku)

62
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,180
(exhale)

63
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:46,160
All right.

64
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,240
Ugh! Come on!

65
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,940
Damn it! Alright.

66
00:03:51,940 --> 00:04:01,020
DAHHHHHHH (louder)

67
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,900

68
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:10,620

Oh! It's a push!(? BOY!)

71
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:24,540
IF PEOPLE WERE ANIME!

72
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,220
