AAAAAAAAAAAH

11
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:37,160
&quot;Is Ali-A gay?&quot;

12
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,640
&quot;And I guess this is a good time to address this question.&quot;

13
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,740
Since some of you guys ask... the answer is..

14
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:43,640
(out of line) YES.

15
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,000

22
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,840

23
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,500
A few weeks ago I made a video on Fortnite and

24
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,720
uhh, nothing has changed basically,

25
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,980
it's still the same.

26
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:16,880
The absolute state of YouTube Gaming is uhh, very much still uhh...

27
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,560
AaAhAahAAah

28
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,320
Haaaaaaaaawh????

29
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,200
Hmmmmmmmmm.

30
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,160
AHHHHHAWWHHHH

31
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,840
OWAAAAWAAAAH.

32
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,060
Heeeehhhhehh

33
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,500
I love these thumbnails,

34
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,440
they're so good.

35
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,220
It's basically the SOI boy equivalent...of a thumbnail,

36
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,420
and I know what you're thinking:

37
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:39,300
PeWdIePiE, u R jUsT sAlTy BeCuZ AlI-A hAs MoRe ViEwS tHeN u Do!!!11!!!

38
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:42,420
Listen, I am happy for my man Ali

39
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:43,320
A

40
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,330
I am a glad to see,

41
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:49,120
really good content thrive on this platform as always.

42
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,560
Ok? He makes the best content.

43
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,420
You know here we have a video called:

44
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,640
&quot;The Superman Challenge&quot;

45
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,940
WOW! Superman is in Fortnite?

46
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,820
Oh, I best watch 25 minutes to find out!

47
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,780
That's how we're doing that is how w...

48
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,220
How w...

49
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:04,860
tha...

50
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,060
Look at that! [x3]

51
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,660
Edited! [x2]

52
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,820
Don't move! [x2]

53
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,120
*pew*

54
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,720
O? OH! My go-  wha- I died?!

55
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,760
We did it guys, we completed every single one of the challenge points!

56
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,620
That was a lot of fun.

57
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:21,660
And if you've got any more challenge ideas do leave them down below. (don't)

58
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,380
O- Oh, I guess there isn't...

59
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:28,220
Oh, what? Th- the Flash is in Fortnite?!

60
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,480
Nope. No, it isn't.

61
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:35,760
The Hulk?! The Hulk is in Fortnite?! I must watch this 22 minutes and 35 seconds video right now!

62
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,480
This is not clickbait guys!

63
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,160
This is what the content is,

64
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,240
it's reflecting the content,

65
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,960
just like my videos are always 100% accurate.

66
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:48,060
Lately the... the trend of Fortnite clickbait has been, uh: What's inside?

67
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,240
&quot;What's Inside&quot;

68
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,560
You have a concept of something: What's inside it?

69
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,040
A free present from Epic Games? What's inside?

70
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,000
Ooh, I must watch to find out, what could it be?

71
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,820
Awhh-a

72
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:04,760
What is it inside? I need to know what is in that package. What did they give me?

73
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,500
And why does it take 21 minutes to find out?

74
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,640
So, here we go guys. This is what you look like,

75
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,840
I've actually gone ahead and taking the glider from the very first

76
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,240
Twitch Prime set and added it in for a complete twitch prime look

77
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,020
which is awesome and we are gonna gear up,

78
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:24,860
use this brand new outfit and go ahead and try and go for a victory royale

79
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:27,420
If you like the fact that Epic Games are giving us free skins,

80
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,360
give it a big fat thumbs up as well.

81
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,580
Without further a do, let's check out these new skins.

82
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:35,500
Let's check out our brand new pickaxe as well and try and go for a win.

83
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,160
If you ever liked anything at any time in your life

86
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,660
If we're talking about what's inside things

87
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:44,880
Here we have: &quot;Opening the Bunker - What's INSIDE?&quot;

88
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,960
What I want to know is what's inside Ali-A's hat!

89
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,780
He- I- I mean he's wearing it in every single video.

90
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:54,680
He must be hiding something underneath there. Ah, what could it be?

91
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,160
I have some ideas, but I will keep them to myself.

92
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:03,020
Yes! We are underneath the bunker. We're inside...

93
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:05,900
Inside this new secret bunker...

94
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:10,980
It doesn't look like... there's anything in there.

95
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,880
Like all your content!

96
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,600
*claps while laughing in an evil way*

97
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,020
*inhale*

98
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,840
Gotch you, Ali! *ha-ha!*

99
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,080
I know a lot of you think oh, this is just for kids, Ali-A

100
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,500
is just for kids and that's why it's so popular.

101
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,720
Excuse me. You don't know Ali-A like I know Ali-A.

102
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,360
He's delivering some of the hottest content on YouTube.

103
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,360
Think he's gone into there.

104
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,380
Come on.

105
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,460
Sneak in. [x2]

106
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:38,700
Go on, go inside! Inside, in you go, in you go!

107
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,980
There we goooooo!

108
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:43,520
Let's just destroy it a wider way.

109
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,600
*laugh*

110
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,820
Five kills, so if we get this it will be a six...
Pewds: Wait a minute if he's at five kills and if he gets one more

111
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:53,400
Wait a minute if he's at five kills and if he gets one more

112
00:04:53,400 --> 00:05:02,900
INTENSE MATH SEQUENCE

113
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,420
Then that means...

114
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,440
(STOP IT OMFG) When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of N

115
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,840
I'm just meming. I think Ali-A seems like a really good dude.

116
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,540
We're just joking. We're just joking. It's just a joke.

117
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:18,640
I see a lot of people being so amped up about ehhhhhh...

118
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,220
His content and how bad it is and they get old.

119
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:21,820
I don't know,

120
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:26,180
just if you check Ali's Twitter replies, everyone is just so mad.

121
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:28,240
It's just a game, who cares?

122
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,900
if you compare Ali-A's content to so much else on YouTube,

123
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:37,950
he's honestly it is like one of the least bad at least and I think he gets the most shit probably just because

124
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:45,860
he's one of the biggest ones. So I feel a little bad. Just want to say, Ali you're... you're a...

125
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:50,560
I can't comp- I can't compliment people. It's- it's beyond my comprehension.

126
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,960
But some people just get so mad about the-- the whole Fortnite meme

127
00:05:53,960 --> 00:06:22,640
this is so sad can we hit epic games

128
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,660
*sad sob*

129
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,500
*sad sigh* oohhh...

130
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:32,020
Thank God, we have brave people like Drift0r standing up for Fortnite clickbait.

131
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:32,740
This man,

132
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,640
absolute Saint.

133
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:41,760
Finally that someone that delivers the topic of Fortnite clickbait in a serious manner cause it is very serious.

134
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,900
I just want to watch really good Fortnite videos,

135
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,880
but there's all just clickbait everywhere.

136
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,580
What do I gonna do?

137
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:51,500
Moving on. Let's see what Ninja has been up to.

138
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,760
The number one Fortnite streamer.

139
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,040
Like,

140
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,140
do not bully people.

141
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:00,980
THE FUCK YOU SAY TO ME YOU LITTLE SHIT?!

142
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:01,980
*maniacal laughter*

143
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,860
How are you--- how are you not in fucking school?

144
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,780
You kiss your mother with that mouth?!

145
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:10,680
It's called you---it's called you kiss your mother with that fucking mouth?

146
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,380
Huh?

147
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:14,000
How are you not in school? Well...

148
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,880
It's like asking all your audience

149
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,660
ahaha

150
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:17,980
Huh?

151
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,840
Huh?

152
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,740
*mocking, cracking, maniac gibberish*

153
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,700
Because the fucking youth of socie--

154
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,740
*hysterical laughter* YOU SON OF A

155
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,280
You shut up when I'm talking to you! You shut your mouth!

156
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,580
Do not make fun of anyone.

157
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:32,320
*Felix laughs*

158
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,860
You justify it by like: oh there's a bunch of people doing it it's okay,

159
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:36,700
it's not okay.

160
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,260
Fuck you kid.

161
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,580
You're adopted.

162
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:44,780
*Felix laughs*

163
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,520
Oh

164
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,840
*laughs again*

165
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,160
The level of white knighting, it's almost like he's playing Skyrim.

166
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,220
*clap* *clap* (can we get bonus meme back?) *clap* *clap*

167
00:07:55,220 --> 00:08:00,440
Ninja is clearly not like this anymore. I know eee- it's really unfair to uh...

168
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:05,760
Edit in old footage with new, but it's also very funny. He's clearly uhh...

169
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,720
A lot better these days. Okay. I don't wanna---

170
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,280
I'm just meming guys. Stop taking it so seriously,

171
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,640
I'm sure he's laughing as well.

172
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:19,740
By the way guys did you know??? Thanos is in Fortnite?!

173
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:23,480
Ah! Ah! Aaah!

174
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,580
Thanos! Is in Fortnite! Two most cancerous things that I hate the most in whole world that everyone else seems to love,

175
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:31,280
The two most cancerous things that I hate the most in the whole world that everyone else seems to love,

176
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,789
decided to combine

177
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:35,760
just to spite me. Thank you. Appreciate it.

178
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,800
Uh-oh, Thanos got arrested!

179
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,540
I guess part two of Avengers Infinity War is cancelled now.

180
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,940
Sorry kids, no more Thanos.

181
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,520
Just like there's no more content from Ali-A playing Fortnite,

182
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,400
now that he deleted Fortnite.

183
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,960
&quot;This made Ali-A delete Fortnite&quot;

184
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,020
*laugh*

185
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:58,000
Is he referring himself in third person just to clickbait himself?

186
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,060
THAT'S GENIUS!!!

187
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:12,360
Nooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!

188
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,420
Nooooo!!!

189
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:18,560
Who will I spend 25 minutes watching daily?

190
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,840
Dammit.

191
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,480
Let's see how Summit is doing.

192
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,013
I'm fucking dead dude. [x2]

193
00:09:23,013 --> 00:09:23,700
I'm fucking- yeah.

194
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,800
there's just nothing I-

195
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,940
*rage quit*

196
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:30,340
*damn*

197
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,540
Getting offline guys!

198
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,740
These ehhh...

199
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,200
*laughs*

200
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:39,120
These battle royale type games really brings out the best of people doesn't it?

201
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,260
You know, I can't relate to this whatsoever

202
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:46,180
because I've never let out something embarrassing at an--- at an---*we don't talk about that Bridge in PUBG*

203
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:51,970
At an intense gaming moment. That just wouldn't happen to me. Okay. I'm not some pathetic-

204
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:54,129
screechy gamer that

205
00:09:54,129 --> 00:09:58,380
that lets video games for children control my emotions, okay?

206
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,620
Just does not happen, okay? (THE BRIDGE THE BRIDGE THE BRIDGE)

207
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,020
Did I mention...

208
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,720
Thanos is in Fortnite?!

209
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,080
*dab* *dab*

210
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,480
YEAH!!!

211
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,960
Oh my god!

212
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:14,040
Smash like right now guys if you enjoy Thanos in Fortnite just as much as I do.

213
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,799
You've probably seen this meme already, but it's so funny.

214
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:22,769
These eh- one like equals one strip videos got so out of hand that some dude

215
00:10:22,769 --> 00:10:30,340
just thought hey, I can just bring my 13 year old sister in here and she can get naked for views on YouTube!

216
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,460
Yaes, what a great idea!

217
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:35,120
Basically me and my 13 year old sister are gonna be playing Fortnite

218
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,420
and if I get a kill she has to take something off of me.

219
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,400
One day later.

220
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:43,280
*Curb Your Enthusiasm plays* I really do understand why child pornography is not allowed.

221
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,500
But in my mind, I know it wasn't child pornography.

222
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:50,420
I know it's not child porn. You know what I mean? [x2]

223
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:51,980
*bee buzzing*

224
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:52,840
You know what I mean?

225
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:57,920
What's about a government and literally a government law saying...

226
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,120
...restrictions on screens and bans on...

227
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,140
for instance Fortnite has an age limit of 12?

228
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:07,660
Fortnite has just become such a problem now for parents that they-- they even propose...

229
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,880
A government ban.

230
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,260
What a great idea! (SUFFOLK MAPPING THINKS SO AS WELL SINCE HE HATES FORTNITE TO DEATH AND When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among th

231
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,580
Thanks Fortnite.

232
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,120
I'm not a pedophile

233
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,440
Uh- that's really, really weird.

234
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,740
And there you have it. That is the absolute state of YouTube Gaming. Of Fortnite.

235
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,240
Thank you Fortnite.

236
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,700
If you guys wanna find out about an even better game than Fortnite:

237
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,920
Check out A$$, coming out May 15th!

238
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:35,320
Hooray!

239
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:54,000
