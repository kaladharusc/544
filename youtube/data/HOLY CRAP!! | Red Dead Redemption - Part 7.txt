74
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:55,300
preacher and town sheriff rink a sailor

75
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,190
under the table before breakfast

76
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:00,370
he had one tiny hand like a child on the

77
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:03,310
end of a grown man's arm but anyway this

78
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:04,660
tells you what kind of people the

79
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:07,120
braithwaite's are selling moonshine to

80
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,849

this year alone yeesh that seems like a

86
00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:24,250
considerable problem you think that the

87
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,630
government would have sent someone after

88
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:27,729
that that's that's not a localized thing

89

that's a that's a big deal that's a big

90
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:36,090

00:21:23,629 --> 00:21:26,419
last call responded I have traveled

328
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:31,869
widely making no small name for myself

329
00:21:31,869 --> 00:21:36,019
before you ask I am still yet to take a

330
00:21:36,019 --> 00:21:39,049
wife but I can assure you it's not for a

331
00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:53,360
lack of suitors there was this return to

332
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:58,940
Tacitus Gogol oh there that's Oh mail we

333
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:02,149
sent the same alien whenever we set up

334
00:22:02,149 --> 00:22:03,139
somewhere new

335
00:22:03,139 --> 00:22:05,779
Stroud she heads into town doesn't the

336
00:22:05,779 --> 00:22:08,509
start expected mail from us TAS is

337
00:22:08,509 --> 00:22:15,409
killed or whatever they changed it to

338
00:22:15,409 --> 00:22:17,759
now this is odd there's like the first

339
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:20,249
time that this lady that we rescued and

340
00:22:20,249 --> 00:22:23,100
I've interacted I think this entire time

341
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,779
the most I was like I saw her and choses

342
00:22:24,779 --> 00:22:26,220
like having a tough time of crying on

343
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,899
the side but I think I think this is the

344
00:22:27,899 --> 00:22:30,450
same same person it's hard to tell

345
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:33,299
sometimes it really is but yeah I would

346
00:22:33,299 --> 00:22:34,019
have thought that there would have been

347
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,340
a lot more interaction from the get-go

348
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,679
but then again the story is not nearly

349
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:41,749
complete not anywhere close to complete

350
00:22:41,749 --> 00:22:43,830
this is where we're going in is this

351
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:44,580
place all right

352
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:51,330

it it's a supply wagon carrying payroll

545
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:34,950
but very briefly unguarded apparently as

546
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:37,290
it passes through a crossroads near here

547
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:39,120
where there's an old ruined church

548
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:42,750
before it connects with the rest of the

549
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:45,900
wagon train very easy pick as long as we

550
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:54,270
get paid or you get shot yeah whatever

551

oh I'm Shawn yep how are you miss O'Shea

1085
01:14:49,909 --> 01:14:52,199
around here do you need some help

1086
01:14:52,199 --> 01:14:54,569
I don't know about that I think the only

1087
01:14:54,569 --> 01:14:58,050
the only quest is gonna be Micah over

1088
01:14:58,050 --> 01:15:00,659
here and my god I don't want to go see

1089
01:15:00,659 --> 01:15:03,780
Micah but what I can do I think I can go

1090
01:15:03,780 --> 01:15:06,449
to the stagecoach and go into strawberry

1091
01:15:06,449 --> 01:15:09,269
somehow yeah maybe I couldn't use the

1092
01:15:09,269 --> 01:15:11,280
stagecoaches because I had a bounty on

1093
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:12,929
my head that's entirely possible

1094
01:15:12,929 --> 01:15:15,539
I mean it would make sense considering

1095
01:15:15,539 --> 01:15:16,979
that they probably wouldn't want to give

1096
01:15:16,979 --> 01:15:20,129
me anything credible yeah well I'll try

1097
01:15:20,129 --> 01:15:22,109
because if I can it would save me a big

1098
01:15:22,109 --> 01:15:25,559
big big big big amount of time and I

1099
01:15:25,559 --> 01:15:27,149
don't have time to waste come on come on

1100
01:15:27,149 --> 01:15:29,459
horsey let's go into town let's go see

1101
01:15:29,459 --> 01:15:31,289
something about a stagecoach I know that

1102
01:15:31,289 --> 01:15:32,819
other horse that I have is somewhere out

1103
01:15:32,819 --> 01:15:34,859
in the middle of nowhere somehow still

1104
01:15:34,859 --> 01:15:37,109
loyal enough to me to stay out there no

1105
01:15:37,109 --> 01:15:42,839
way it's over there oh well this is

1106
01:15:42,839 --> 01:15:43,439
awkward

1107
01:15:43,439 --> 01:15:45,959
other horsey I just don't care enough so

1108
01:15:45,959 --> 01:15:47,789
goodbye alright let's go get the

1109
01:15:47,789 --> 01:15:49,139
stagecoach and then let's go see Micah

1110
01:15:49,139 --> 01:15:51,899
it's it's it's amazing how much my one

1111
01:15:51,899 --> 01:15:53,999
encounter with Micah my one mission

1112
01:15:53,999 --> 01:15:56,069
alone with Micah has made me so

1113
01:15:56,069 --> 01:15:59,189
adamantly against working with Micah

1114
01:15:59,189 --> 01:16:02,099
like it's like it's visceral for me I

1115
01:16:02,099 --> 01:16:04,499
just cannot do it because I hate him so

1116
01:16:04,499 --> 01:16:09,059
much like what a shit stain of a human

1117
01:16:09,059 --> 01:16:12,059
oh god damn it why is it locked off damn

1118
01:16:12,059 --> 01:16:14,879
it alright I guess I'll go on foot then

1119
01:16:14,879 --> 01:16:19,559
fuck fine I guess we're going yeah I

1120
01:16:19,559 --> 01:16:22,229
mean that's a it's like a contribution

1121
01:16:22,229 --> 01:16:23,979
to the writing of the game

1122
01:16:23,979 --> 01:16:26,739
only three on that hill I'm gonna see

1123
01:16:26,739 --> 01:16:28,179
that tree I want to see that tree that's

1124
01:16:28,179 --> 01:16:31,420
a nice tree it's a nice tree on that

1125
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:32,949
hill over there I wanna go over there

1126
01:16:32,949 --> 01:16:34,630
just because I like that tree

1127
01:16:34,630 --> 01:16:38,559
yeah but Micah like I I know that this

1128
01:16:38,559 --> 01:16:40,389
game is probably gonna throw the gambit

1129
01:16:40,389 --> 01:16:42,010
of characters that I do like and not

1130
01:16:42,010 --> 01:16:44,860
like I mean don't get me wrong one thing

1131
01:16:44,860 --> 01:16:46,420
I like about like stories and stuff like

1132
01:16:46,420 --> 01:16:48,400
that is I don't care if I'm supposed to

1133
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:50,679
not like a character like if I if a

1134
01:16:50,679 --> 01:16:52,239
character is written to be hated that's

1135
01:16:52,239 --> 01:16:52,869
great

1136
01:16:52,869 --> 01:16:54,159
that means the character is well written

1137
01:16:54,159 --> 01:16:56,469
but if it's like if there's a potential

1138
01:16:56,469 --> 01:16:59,709
for a character to be so viciously evil

1139
01:16:59,709 --> 01:17:02,499
I want the writers to take every liberty

1140
01:17:02,499 --> 01:17:05,019
in making that character the most evil

1141
01:17:05,019 --> 01:17:06,429
character that it could possibly be

1142
01:17:06,429 --> 01:17:08,800
because that's good writing that's just

1143
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:10,360
good storytelling I feel like that's

1144
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:13,119
needed that has to happen or else there

1145
01:17:13,119 --> 01:17:14,349
wasn't any point in doing it in the

1146
01:17:14,349 --> 01:17:17,769
first place yeah cuz cuz it's like

1147
01:17:17,769 --> 01:17:20,289
without it without it you just end up

1148
01:17:20,289 --> 01:17:22,539
with oh you oh there you go without it

1149
01:17:22,539 --> 01:17:23,889
you just end up with characters that are

1150
01:17:23,889 --> 01:17:26,829
boring and like with with humanizing

1151
01:17:26,829 --> 01:17:28,239
characteristics and in a way it is

1152
01:17:28,239 --> 01:17:30,010
humanizing to have someone that's just

1153
01:17:30,010 --> 01:17:31,690
so viciously horrifying that you hate

1154
01:17:31,690 --> 01:17:35,170
him oh three star but then again that

1155
01:17:35,170 --> 01:17:37,239
can happen to everybody no I didn't

1156
01:17:37,239 --> 01:17:38,320
upgrade my satchel

1157
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:40,269

1160
01:17:44,139 --> 01:17:46,030
gonna save these sides to whatever I

1161
01:17:46,030 --> 01:17:47,590
eventually make my way back to Pearson

1162
01:17:47,590 --> 01:17:50,139

1170
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:22,730
it's also like I'm catching myself

1171
01:18:22,730 --> 01:18:24,080
because I'm getting so engrossed in the

1172
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:26,540
game that I'm going into like my normal

1173
01:18:26,540 --> 01:18:28,610
like long-term gameplay mode where I'm

1174
01:18:28,610 --> 01:18:30,680
just like sink into a blank expression

1175
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:33,020
don't talk at all and then just go play

1176
01:18:33,020 --> 01:18:34,220

engrossing like I could definitely see

1181
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:46,820
myself playing this game all day for

1182
01:18:46,820 --> 01:18:54,870

1187
01:19:07,030 --> 01:19:11,170
like sci-fi horror movie squealing going

1212
01:20:45,030 --> 01:20:47,940
but I think I might got something even

1213
01:20:47,940 --> 01:20:50,459
better some of those fellows talked

1214
01:20:50,459 --> 01:20:52,170
about this old crone of North a

1215
01:20:52,170 --> 01:20:55,829
strawberry got herself a tidy sum locked

1216
01:20:55,829 --> 01:20:59,550
away maybe just stories but they were

1217
01:20:59,550 --> 01:21:03,030
sure excited oh yeah why would I be

1218
01:21:03,030 --> 01:21:07,229
interested in that huh I'm just a hunch

1219
01:21:07,229 --> 01:21:10,320
it's up to you friend all right whatever

1220
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:12,900
you say I'm not much for home robberies

1221
01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:14,309
they make it a little too stressful for

1222
01:21:14,309 --> 01:21:15,869
me so I don't know if I'm gonna be down

1223
01:21:15,869 --> 01:21:17,550
for that but

1224
01:21:17,550 --> 01:21:22,770
fuck it in there I might be interested

1225
01:21:22,770 --> 01:21:24,270
oh there's something going on over there

1226
01:21:24,270 --> 01:21:26,460
but I gotta get over to mica god that's

1227
01:21:26,460 --> 01:21:28,110
the thing about this game this is like

1228
01:21:28,110 --> 01:21:29,910
because I'm flabbergasted at the amount

1229
01:21:29,910 --> 01:21:32,160
of content that's in the main storyline

1230
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:33,930
like 40 hours of gameplay in the main

1231
01:21:33,930 --> 01:21:36,450
storyline but just imagine how much

1232
01:21:36,450 --> 01:21:39,600
content is in the side storylines just

1233
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:41,340
imagine how much content oh my god it's

1234
01:21:41,340 --> 01:21:44,160
so pretty oh it's so pretty just imagine

1235
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:45,510
how much content is gonna be in like

1236
01:21:45,510 --> 01:21:48,390
DLCs and stuff like this how many years

1237
01:21:48,390 --> 01:21:51,030
did they spend working on this game God

1238
01:21:51,030 --> 01:21:52,650
if it's been since the first one that

1239
01:21:52,650 --> 01:21:53,730
they've been working on this one it's

1240
01:21:53,730 --> 01:21:57,720
been eight years I still marvel at that

1241
01:21:57,720 --> 01:22:00,330
idea the idea that it's just such a huge

1242
01:22:00,330 --> 01:22:02,160
team of people so much money put into

1243
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:04,290
this game so much work put into this

1244
01:22:04,290 --> 01:22:05,880
game so much effort just getting it

1245
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:08,040
right every nuance hey I mean I've

1246
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:09,450
encountered some bugs but you're never

1247
01:22:09,450 --> 01:22:11,850
gonna get rid of all bugs in a game you

1248
01:22:11,850 --> 01:22:13,470
never make anything actually perfect

1249
01:22:13,470 --> 01:22:14,580
especially when things are a little bit

1250
01:22:14,580 --> 01:22:16,440
procedural and all over the place but oh

1251
01:22:16,440 --> 01:22:22,110
my god I always come back to it I always

1252
01:22:22,110 --> 01:22:23,700
come back to it just how beautiful this

1253
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:26,400
isn't how scary these woods are I was

1254
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:27,690
thinking about it again you know how

1255
01:22:27,690 --> 01:22:29,730
there's some piers some experiences that

1256
01:22:29,730 --> 01:22:31,620
I'll never be able to do I mean I

1257
01:22:31,620 --> 01:22:33,390
recommend that everybody try to have as

1258
01:22:33,390 --> 01:22:35,790
many experiences as you can but there's

1259
01:22:35,790 --> 01:22:37,920
some things that I'm like I guess I may

1260
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:39,750
never in my life go to space no matter

1261
01:22:39,750 --> 01:22:41,340
how much I love it just because you love

1262
01:22:41,340 --> 01:22:42,390
something doesn't mean it's gonna happen

1263
01:22:42,390 --> 01:22:45,000
I didn't spend my life working towards

1264
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,730
that goal so you know that's not gonna

1265
01:22:47,730 --> 01:22:48,090
happen

1266
01:22:48,090 --> 01:22:50,670
and I mean it's a pretty common thing to

1267
01:22:50,670 --> 01:22:52,740
be shared with a lot of people in in

1268
01:22:52,740 --> 01:22:54,690
human society but at the same time it's

1269
01:22:54,690 --> 01:22:58,050
like man I wonder I wonder what else I

1270
01:22:58,050 --> 01:22:59,880
could do that could make myself go even

1271
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:02,160
farther I wonder where I could go with

1272
01:23:02,160 --> 01:23:04,650
my life I wonder what I could do that

1273
01:23:04,650 --> 01:23:06,600
could really push me even further than

1274
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:07,980
I've come already and I've come pretty

1275
01:23:07,980 --> 01:23:10,140
far I know that I recognize that very

1276
01:23:10,140 --> 01:23:12,540
much so but I still think about that on

1277
01:23:12,540 --> 01:23:15,690
a daily basis I really do I think about

1278
01:23:15,690 --> 01:23:18,570
what I can do more about well good I

1279
01:23:18,570 --> 01:23:20,650
could do like how I could do more

1280
01:23:20,650 --> 01:23:22,570
because I always want to push myself

1281
01:23:22,570 --> 01:23:24,460
until I can't push myself anymore

1282
01:23:24,460 --> 01:23:26,890
and not that this game and this

1283
01:23:26,890 --> 01:23:28,720
character reminds me of that but the the

1284
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:30,280
people who made this game remind me of

1285
01:23:30,280 --> 01:23:32,370
that they make me think about that I

1286
01:23:32,370 --> 01:23:35,110
think it's a fascinating part of the

1287
01:23:35,110 --> 01:23:36,610
human experience to try to keep pushing

1288
01:23:36,610 --> 01:23:37,990
yourself as far as you can until you

1289
01:23:37,990 --> 01:23:41,800
can't push anymore so oh whoops I

1290
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:43,210
thought I needed to be somewhere else

1291
01:23:43,210 --> 01:23:45,960
all right let me hop off actually ah

1292
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:48,160
well I'll just have to wait till they

1293
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:50,680
actually make Westworld then I can just

1294
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:52,690

1335
01:25:54,550 --> 01:25:59,090
that's a good lead in my book damn old

1336
01:25:59,090 --> 01:26:01,430
Driscoll's are everywhere if they've

1337

when you put us in danger and we don't

1345

1406
01:30:02,950 --> 01:30:08,880
a favorite weapon ranking 13 and 59 ooh

1407
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:10,900
familiarity I didn't even know familiar

1408
01:30:10,900 --> 01:30:12,760
8 it was a thing in guns is that why my

1409
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:14,470
guns got better say why I got better

1410
01:30:14,470 --> 01:30:16,390
with him that would make a lot of sense

1411
01:30:16,390 --> 01:30:17,860
Dodd would make a lot of sense where

1412
01:30:17,860 --> 01:30:19,600
some of these guns that I haven't used

1413
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:20,940
in a while

1414
01:30:20,940 --> 01:30:26,140

1415
01:30:26,140 --> 01:30:29,110
bolt-action I'm already getting some

1416
01:30:29,110 --> 01:30:31,600
familiarity with it that's so

1417

interesting how about Mike my pistol

1418
