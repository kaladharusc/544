00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:00,500
*POP*

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,100
I'm Poppy Harlow and you're watching Pew News.

3
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:03,980
[ayy finally]

4
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:07,660
The most News News site of all time.

5
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:17,660
*Best news intro*

6
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,380
First of...

7
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:20,460
MERCH

8
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:21,400
Okay?

9
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,880
MERCH

10
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,480
What? DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND?

11
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,240
There is new MERCH.

12
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,620
What are you doing?

13
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:29,940
Now I'm Poppy Harlow *noshit*

14
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,440
and I'm not supposed to give my own opinion

15
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:36,020
but I'm gonna make an exception and say that this is THE HOTTEST MERCH.

16
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,700
He brought back the Cyka Blyat shirt-hat-thing. [buys]

17
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:39,660
*POP*

18
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:40,660
*Please Buy Merch*

19
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:42,020
*Pewds needs money. He always get D-monetized*

20
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,480
We really have just two news I want to
talk about, there hasn't been that much -

21
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,760
that I care about.

22
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,560
The first one is about
FfoRtNiTe. Everyone's favourite game...

23
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:57,300
Apparently now parents are paying tutors
for teaching their kids to become better at

24
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,960
Fortnite.

25
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,220
*cute skrrata from god *

26
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:02,180
These scrubs...

27
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:05,060
This is what
happens when you birth beta

28
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:08,680
Beta children that needs help (grammar) to become
better.

29
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,320
PATHETIC

30
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,440
Really what they should be doing...

31
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,640
is giving their children. [???]

32
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,400
According to the article that originated from -

33
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,500
The Wall Street Journal *oh the memories*

34
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,520
There's pressure not to just play it

35
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,360
but to be really good at it [lol not really]

36
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,000
*professional Newsmaker burping everybody*

37
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,120
Do they not know that all they gotta do

38
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,120
to be good at the game is-

39
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:25,900
you just need to-

40
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,880
you don't need to learn the game.

41
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:33,310
You just gotta be exTREMLY good at
Photoshop, okay? There you go everybody.

42
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:34,320
Problem solved.

43
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,680
You don't have to pay 20
bucks an hour

44
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,060
to teach your kids

45
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:41,140
'Cause apparently that's what's happening. You can go to

46
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,380
this website called Gamer Sensei.

47
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,900
If you
want to improving games, I mean fair enough.

48
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,580
I can't really hate on that.

49
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:51,320
I just find it funny that parents think

50
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:56,040
it's somehow required to give their
children this so that they can seem

51
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,020
cooler or fit in you know?

52
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,540
BACK IN MY DAY

53
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,020
I couldn't get my parents to buy me

54
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,500
anything gaming related so HEY

55
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,960
props to
you parents.

56
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,500
I guess I don't know.

57
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,860
This parent called Nick Menon says has been
paying coaches to tutor his son.

58
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:17,500
Noble said the 12 year old's gone from
struggling in the game to throwing down

59
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,040
10 to 20 wins

60
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,740
[Not that much...]

61
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,200
DAMN son!

62
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:22,700
[PEWS IT'S NOT THAT MUCH COME ON]

63
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,760
You know when
when I was a child

64
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,540
World of Warcraft was the game that
everyone played

65
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,180
I remember if you weren't playing World of Warcraft

66
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:34,280
You weren't really part of that the social group or whatever

67
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,740
Or Tibia it was
actually Tibia but regardless there

68
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,680
wasn't really any requirement for you to
be good at the game

69
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,480
I guess now that big game is fortnite.

70
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,640
Kids want to be good at it

71
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,420
And seem better than they are it's an
interesting phenomenon a lot of people

72
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:53,840
are justifying this as: &quot;oh I can train my
child so that they can become pro&quot;

73
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,940
Yes because fortnite will definitely be
relevant in another couple years

74
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,580
That seems like a great investment [lol no]

75
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,100
it's not just social exclusion.

76
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,980
That is causing some parents to turn to tutors

77
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:10,240
*9yrs old* :&quot;You are not good at Fortnite you can't hang with us&quot;

78
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,940
Jimmy comes back couple lessons later

79
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,080
Throwing down 10 or 20 wins.

80
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,080
Gets all the women

81
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,460
Saves the day

82
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,580
Jimmy is a legend

83
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:18,320
*POP*

84
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:22,000
One collegiate eSports club called
Tesla announced this year it would offer

85
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,140
Over 1 million in scholarships and
prizes to student competing in

86
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,560
Six different video games

87
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,200
This reminds me of. 
I think in Japan they have like Youtube schools

88
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:39,340
because it's because it's such a
popular phenomenon to be a youtuber in Japan

89
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:43,640
And it's not like anyone that
finished these schools have become any YouTuber

90
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,050
This is one of those useless
things you could get into that won't

91
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:50,800
lead up to anything I'm not saying that
that's necessarily the case here

92
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:55,380
but it does sound fairly familiar it's also
interesting because I reflected myself a

93
00:03:55,380 --> 00:04:02,000
couple days ago on how the approach to
YouTube has shifted tremendously

94
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,840
When I started I mean when Pewdiepie started
YouTube it was eight years ago I felt

95
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,580
like I was the Biggest Loser ever even
just talking alone in a room in front of

96
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:17,080
a camera that was just unheard of even
just talking into a microphone alone on

97
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:21,220
camera it was just weird you wouldn't do
that you were a weirdo if you did it

98
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:21,720
*Pop*

99
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,840
*Pew Pew Pew Pew Pew*

100
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,580
Surprise surprise there's another news
article about PewDiePie

101
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:30,140
Tagged W T F influencers.

102
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,800
What did he do this time huh
can't even go a week

103
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,800
PewDiePie makes fake claims over sponsored videos.

104
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,380
Posted byDdigiday who claims to be

105
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,700
About authority, insight and honesty

106
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,200
*Type X for Doubt*

107
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,140
So they're basically saying that

108
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:51,460
I'm claiming to be sponsored by Volvo when
really I wasn't and saying that I make

109
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:56,330
fake claims over sponsored videos. I love
how they don't allow comments on the

110
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:59,900
article so the only way to really find
out what people think and I think it's

111
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:04,200
pretty unanimous and this is a how do I
not swear it's a bad story

112
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:09,439
The video that they are referring to is me playing
PUBG I feel like at this point I need

113
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:14,180
to just stop replying because the more I
reply then more inevitably I'm going to

114
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:18,560
get more hit pieces like this because it
just reinforces that I'm against the

115
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,060
media and therefore I'm an villain in
the media's I and I just gonna keep on

116
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:26,960
going and going and these will just
appear but this is this one is just too

117
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,480
funny and not to bring up

118
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:35,780
it's me playing pubg driving around in a car

119
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,680
*Sponsored by Volvo*

120
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:43,760
That's it. Surprise surprise
Volvo the car manufacturing company

121
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:49,720
Did not pay me to play PUBG to drive around
in a car that's not even a Volvo

122
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,520
It's a dacia. It's a big surprise big shocker. I know.

123
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,760
So what this website decided to do

124
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:01,060
instead of having a brain was well it
says in the title is sponsored by Volvo

125
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:05,560
so we're gonna reach out to Volvo and
ask them

126
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,860
*Curb my pasta*

127
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,860
And guess what they said

128
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:11,200
No it isn't. Surprise. Big surprise everyone.

129
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,040
It's not sponsored by Volvo

130
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:18,380
That video wasn't actually sponsored by Volvo
according to a Volvo spokesperson

131
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:22,400
First paragraph. Cool alright cool.
This seemed like a great article.

132
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,740
But it keeps going. Volvo was unaware of this
association with PewDiePie

133
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:33,740
They're not associated. It's a joke. I'm driving
around killing people with a car

134
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:39,740
It's a joke. It's a joke why do I have to spell
it out do I have to say it every time I

135
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:43,820
know it's like I meme that I always go
it's a joke but this is taking it to

136
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:49,400
next level so they reached out to Volvo
and then reached out to me as well

137
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:54,080
I saw the email and I thought that is the
dumbest thing they cannot be serious

138
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,080
they cannot be seriously writing an
article about this so I changed the

139
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:02,569
title to sponsored by Saab so what do
they do they reach out to Saab as well

140
00:07:02,569 --> 00:07:08,310
on August 3rd more evidence
popped up to indicate Volvo did not

141
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:13,100
sponsor the video they're really living up
to the insight and the honesty here

142
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:18,870
definitely good doing a good job they
found more evidence guys that this was

143
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:25,710
not actually sponsored after do today's
email to PewDiePie's channel the title

144
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:30,280
was changed to sponsored by Saab and
they actually they reach out to Saab as well

145
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,640
They reach out

146
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:36,760
Why? Why? Why? Did you
reach out to Saab as well

147
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,200
Are you that *Dumb*

148
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:42,720
You can't there's no way you're not
stupid. Saab responded we do not have a

149
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,340
sponsor relationship with him and had no
knowledge of that YouTube video prior your email

150
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:52,340
a Saab spokesperson emailed.

151
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,520
They reached out to Saab as well.

152
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,930
So by their logic is that he said that the
video was sponsored by Volvo for a year

153
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:02,640
and then all the sudden and it's not
sponsored by Volvo and then all the

154
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:07,890
sudden a year after it gets changed to
sponsored by Saab so we better make sure

155
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:14,400
to reach out to Saab to make sure for
more evidence that it isn't actually

156
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,760
sponsored by Saab.

157
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,300
*Meme Review X Pew News*

158
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,500
it's pretty clear that
they're not that stupid

159
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:28,770
Like no one is this dumb. That's the thing.It's clear
they're pretending to be dumb just so

160
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:34,170
that they can go around and ask brands
like is it true is it true so what

161
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:38,550
they're implying in this article here is
saying that advertisers often take their

162
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:42,390
cues from other advertisers in the
decision whether to work with an

163
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:47,550
influencer, Pewdipie may have thought
that other advertisers would see the

164
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:51,600
volvo video as a sign that the
controversy is over so there's basically

165
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,100
implying that this wasn't just a joke
this was me trying to make so that

166
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,220
branch would pay me money
tricking people into this video was

167
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:04,230
actually sponsored by Volvo so that I
could make more money I'm just saying

168
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:09,630
what they think this is I
I know it's ridiculous so they can reach

169
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:13,050
out to a bunch of brands that I work
with it's just it's basically another

170
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:16,620
way to hurt my brand they just want
people to know that

171
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:19,940
Hey PewDiePie is a controversial youtuber you shouldn't be working with him and

172
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:25,170
I agreed like if you if you're a company and you're not
aware of who I am you shouldn't be

173
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:28,860
working with me either.
I'm not trying to trick people into

174
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:34,800
paying me I want to have genuine good
relationships with brands

175
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,660
Luckily I'm not dependent on working with brands to
do what I do but when videos get

176
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:43,660
Demonetize which does happen so it's a
nice way to counter that I always pick

177
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:47,940
brands that I know that you guys will
enjoy as well what will make an

178
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:52,110
entertaining video or a product that you
might be interested in the chairs for

179
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:57,300
example is a great example because we
did the promotion just at probably the

180
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:01,890
worst time ever they took a leap to work
with me and he turned out great it was a

181
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:05,700
great promotion and obviously the whole
meme happened and it was just a really

182
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:09,030
successful thing and fans loved it too
it was great for the company and that's

183
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:12,840
the thing I want people to know yes I am
a controversial figure I don't care

184
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:17,640
about working with you if you don't know
who I am. So this article is just a way

185
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:22,080
to as dumb as it is this is a way to
basically try and hurt me even more and

186
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:26,790
these articles just keep coming and they
keep coming and it's just so pity and

187
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:31,860
it's so desperate and it's so reaching
and it just ruins the credibility of

188
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:36,750
your website. I feel like there's a such
a disconnect between the corporate world

189
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:42,060
and the culture on the internet and
that's why there's a disconnect

190
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:46,920
between what my brand is and how a lot
of bigger corporations perceive it a lot

191
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:52,770
of times the brands that a lot of big
companies love all the big youtuber

192
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:57,900
names that appear in the in the rewind
or whatever those are the type of brands

193
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,960
that most people on the internet
actually don't respect

194
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:06,810
It seems like their worlds are completely upside-down
the more you appeal to the corporate

195
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:11,630
culture the less respected you are on
the internet for being dishonest because

196
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:15,530
people are smart enough to see through
it I don't know I kind of went off on a

197
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:20,600
tangent didn't I. I genuinely don't
want to pick fights with the media like I'm

198
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:26,090
It's tiresome I'd be lying if I said
that you know obviously it's fun to

199
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:30,380
laugh at these articles but when they
come in all the time it's annoying it's

200
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:34,850
frustrating because I know people don't
understand it most of it probably it's

201
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:38,000
because of me I don't want to pay myself
as a victim or anything because I know a

202
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,720
lot of it is self-inflicted but I do
think I get a lot more

203
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,480
SHATT

204
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,800
Than I deserve
and I think this article is it

205
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:50,600
An example of that because anyone with the
brain were just understand this was

206
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:56,990
clearly a joke and especially it was a
joke that could not hurt anyone it's not

207
00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:01,130
an offensive joke it's just a joke what
do you think let me know leave like if
