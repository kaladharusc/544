1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,790
hi everyone my name is Tamara chambers

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:06,720
and this is Tamara just saw and tonight

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,099
I wouldn't saw no tonight I went and saw

4
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:13,769
Bohemian Rhapsody since starting Tamra's

5
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:15,330
never seen in Tamara just saw a lot of

6
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,730
people have wanted me to branch out and

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,199
do other things like video games and

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,470
music so here's a small episode of

9
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:27,060
tamara has heard and it's Queen this is

10
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,310
not my shirt I stole this from the chain

11
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,080
awesome studio I'm pretty sure it's like

12
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,800
one of Jim's old shirts so I stole it

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,420
and I borrowed it I borrowed it I'm

14
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,170
returning it back Jim I promise maybe I

15
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:43,379
like a lot of Queen fans and character

16
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:46,950
study in film fans have been I think

17
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:50,789
very excited about this film I was

18
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:52,530
seeing bad times at the El Royale and

19
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,350
Bohemian Rhapsody trailer played for the

20
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,730
film and I looked at the friend that I

21
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:59,160
was seeing it with I was like I wish we

22
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,480
were seeing this instead I don't even

23
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,649
want to see the movie we're seeing right

24
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:07,229
now I'm so pumped to see this film the

25
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:17,759
movie however was kind of mess but I

26
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,229
still had fun

27
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:24,390
it felt so rushed but I still cried at

28
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:29,549
the end it was a terrible script get the

29
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:32,250
actors made it work it was a whole

30
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,979
hodgepodge of things that make a movie

31
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:37,439
bad and somehow I think it's still

32
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:42,689
prevailed but it was on that cusp of

33
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:45,960
just not at all prevailing even the wise

34
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,350
words of Rob Walker Bohemian Rhapsody is

35
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,869
an awesome Queen music video constantly

36
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:54,689
interrupted by a dull Bryan Singer movie

37
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:58,469
great music video though and damn it if

38
00:01:58,469 --> 00:01:59,969
he didn't just like beat me to the punch

39
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:03,329
with that one perfectly stated perfectly

40
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:07,200
stated absolutely true it was thrilling

41
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,149
to watch the music and to watch the

42
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:09,789
acting

43
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:12,670
in the music videos portions of this and

44
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,290
them putting together Bohemian Rhapsody

45
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:16,659
and then putting together all of these

46
00:02:16,659 --> 00:02:19,950
incredible songs and then it was

47
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:23,140
terrible terrible dialogue and scripts

48
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:26,079
work throughout the rest of it which

49
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:29,470
surprises me because it's arguably to

50
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,510
some I would for me personally I think

51
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:34,959
he's the best frontman ever Freddie

52
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,030
Mercury I know this is about Queen as a

53
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:40,060
whole but let's be honest it's about

54
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,280
Freddie Mercury and so to take someone

55
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,459
so weird so unique so bizarre and out

56
00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:47,290
there and fun and fresh and different

57
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:50,650
new and then to put him in this cookie

58
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:54,340
cutter of a script was just so weird

59
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,620
I think the actor really was able to

60
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:59,290
somehow work magic with it because he

61
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,359
was completely believable as the role as

62
00:03:01,359 --> 00:03:03,730
were the other band members I know that

63
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:05,950
the actual band members who are still

64
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:08,340
around they had a big part in this and

65
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,629
they have been pushing through this film

66
00:03:10,629 --> 00:03:11,769
they were like if we don't make it

67
00:03:11,769 --> 00:03:13,659
somebody else is gonna do it poorly and

68
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:18,819
so you know the story on its own is such

69
00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:23,229
an intriguing rise to fame with such an

70
00:03:23,229 --> 00:03:26,290
intriguing person and a character study

71
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:30,010
of this human and so for them to take

72
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:32,049
just this really interesting thing that

73
00:03:32,049 --> 00:03:34,479
I think 90% of us going into this film

74
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:36,280
really wanted it to be like a character

75
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,500
piece about Freddie Mercury I might be

76
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,269
wrong on that maybe I just really wanted

77
00:03:40,269 --> 00:03:43,840
that but knowing full well it was going

78
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,000
to be about Queen as a whole and less

79
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,409
about his personal struggles it was

80
00:03:47,409 --> 00:03:52,449
still like mostly him but I wanted it to

81
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:54,669
be less of this rush to get through like

82
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:57,129
hey I just joined to this band the

83
00:03:57,129 --> 00:03:59,620
smiles and now we're Queen and now oh my

84
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,909
god all of a sudden were writing

85
00:04:00,909 --> 00:04:02,919
Bohemian Rhapsody and oh my god now we

86
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:04,449
have this deal and oh my god now we're

87
00:04:04,449 --> 00:04:07,359
touring the u.s. and I just like really

88
00:04:07,359 --> 00:04:09,220
rushed and like meet my beat by beat by

89
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:12,310
beat is this weird rushed thing we're so

90
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,810
much happened in his life and they put

91
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:16,810
too much in it and not enough they put

92
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:18,669
too many like big milestones and not

93
00:04:18,669 --> 00:04:19,060
enough

94
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:23,410
like small mundane you know struggles I

95
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:26,080
think for me and yet because the story

96
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,830
is so damn engaging at the end I still

97
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:33,160
found myself tearing up crying it like

98
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,130
the build-up of like oh you reconciled

99
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:38,230
with his family and oh my god they did

100
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:40,600
the whole aids live event and oh it's so

101
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,800
beautiful and I cried throughout the

102
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,150
whole thing it was beautiful and great

103
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,630
at because the acting was stellar and

104
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:49,060
it's very powerful to have this story

105
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:51,310
being told through music it's just the

106
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:56,260
parts that weren't a meeting for oh not

107
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:59,500
spectacular I will say that I know a lot

108
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,080
of people were worried about them doing

109
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,530
some by erasure and some queer erasure

110
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:08,919
in the film not focusing on his

111
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:10,900
struggles with AIDS or his you know

112
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,120
sexuality that was on my mind after

113
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,100
seeing the trailer and I know a lot of

114
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,450
people still think that after seeing the

115
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:22,030
film I will say personally that's if it

116
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,700
was a character piece on just him I

117
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:28,419
think I would be very disappointed just

118
00:05:28,419 --> 00:05:31,300
overall but I kiss here if it was a

119
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,270
character piece just hey might I would

120
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,410
definitely agree for what the movie was

121
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,450
I thought that it touched on it and a

122
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:44,410
good amount but you know nothing the

123
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,060
parts of this movie that worked are when

124
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:48,580
we see him in his glory and when we see

125
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:51,610
this amazing actor just crushing it as

126
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:53,289
this character it's so engaging because

127
00:05:53,289 --> 00:05:55,660
we all feel at least if you're a fan of

128
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:58,270
Freddy Mercury you feel like you you

129
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,530
know him right

130
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:02,169
so it's engaging to watch someone really

131
00:06:02,169 --> 00:06:05,320
portray him well in my opinion that's

132
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,090
what those are the person I found really

133
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:09,039
really engaging it all just happened so

134
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,840
fast like I said all of the beats are

135
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,460
just like bam bam bam bam here we are

136
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,960
we're doing this this this this this

137
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,360
this proposed to marry record this song

138
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,400
record the album getting signed you go

139
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,380
on this tour record another thing go to

140
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:24,180
this barn realize your sexuality

141
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,590
so many things all at once and it

142
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:29,349
doesn't play like any of these things

143
00:06:29,349 --> 00:06:30,070
mean

144
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,990
very much there's one point where he

145
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:34,480
proposes to marry and then they get this

146
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,910
US tour and both of these things are

147
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:38,710
giant things but they all happen so

148
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:40,390
close to each other that it's like I

149
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,730
don't feel the weight of any of this I

150
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:45,250
don't feel like this is a giant triumph

151
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:48,220
because it's happening so fast and I

152
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,750
don't know what they should have done to

153
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,370
remedy that because I know so many

154
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,860
things did happen and there's so much

155
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,690
they want to get through to get you at

156
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:57,130
least the timeline that they got you at

157
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:58,780
the end where they're doing the live

158
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:05,980
show but I don't know you know it's just

159
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:09,070
not the character piece that I want for

160
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:12,400
Freddie Mercury man like I said there's

161
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,020
a lot of rushed things if there's a lot

162
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:16,980
of you know things that aren't done well

163
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,870
at all but there's one thing that really

164
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:22,000
just doesn't fit in the movie whereas

165
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,590
they all kind of they all fit in this

166
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:24,910
cookie cutter thing and then there's

167
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:27,760
this one scene where Freddy is throwing

168
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,740
a party and it's kind of meant to show

169
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,960
you how him in the band kind of find

170
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,810
conflict and how he is not meshing well

171
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:36,220
in his life he's kind of feeling

172
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,770
isolated and he meets his partner in the

173
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:40,690
scene a lot of things are happening that

174
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:43,030
need to happen but the scene itself is

175
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:46,330
made you to feel kind of uncomfortable

176
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:49,000
with Freddy like he's being very

177
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,420
flamboyant which he was and the

178
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,800
bandmates are kind of like you're being

179
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,120
a jerk man you're being a jerk and they

180
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,980
leave the party and you know you don't

181
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,480
feel like they're the family that

182
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,490
they've been saying that they are and it

183
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:03,460
feels like you're made to feel kind of

184
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,500
upset at Freddy him and kind of like

185
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,910
your psyche siding with the band and I

186
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:12,850
didn't like that at all not saying that

187
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:14,800
I feel like we should have sided with

188
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,240
Freddy the whole time not saying that he

189
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,580
was a perfect man not saying that he

190
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,200
didn't have faults and that like I can't

191
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,200
feel any like negativity towards him

192
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,210
this scene was just weird it just felt

193
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:28,390
like what are we doing here what's the

194
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:30,430
point of this I feel like they're trying

195
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:32,099
to like pit us against his like

196
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:34,090
flamboyancy which is weird cuz that's

197
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:37,450
who he is so that was very odd I didn't

198
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,280
enjoy that scene at all I wrote and you

199
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,550
know I couldn't help but cry and be

200
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:43,620
through the entire concert show not

201
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,080
through the writing or directing or the

202
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,570
film but because of the man and because

203
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:53,190
of the incredible performer that he was

204
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:56,220
and the insane story that his life was

205
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,220
and that's the end of my notes that's

206
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,709
what I wrote all because of a man that

207
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:04,560
this movie is any good at all and the

208
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,839
band of course but I think they

209
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:11,880
discredited him a lot to not just show

210
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,560
all of his weirdnesses and all of his

211
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,930
you know flamboyant TSA's and all of his

212
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:24,690
is--is I am the cat of the apartment

213
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:27,839
