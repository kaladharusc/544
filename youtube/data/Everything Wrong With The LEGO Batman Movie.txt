[Music]

2
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:11,910
all important movies start with a black

3
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,460
screen movie would be amazing at cinema

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,380
sets and logos really long and dramatic

5
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:21,750
logos only movie is amazing at watching

6
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,779
cinema since get yourself ready for some

7
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:28,349
reading Oh movie is a fan of cinema

8
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:30,480
since also reading if you want to make

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,130
the world a better place if the movie

10
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:33,660
had just said narrating I would have

11
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:34,860
stopped the movie in the sins video

12
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:35,460
right here

13
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,200
shorter sins video ever job would be

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,700
done we'd have an internal discussion

15
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,170
about even releasing it we are

16
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,059
transporting 11 million sticks of

17
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:44,160
Dynamite's huh movie but this is nowhere

18
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,590
near 11 million of anything calling you

19
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,090
out on your humongous exaggeration

20
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,649
because I obviously hate movies way more

21
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:51,270
than I hate myself the helicopter is

22
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:52,680
about to overtake intercept and

23
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,140
overpower a f--king cargo jet wait it's

24
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,160
even worse than I thought

25
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,770
they being landed that chopper on top of

26
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,710
the airplane that man will stop you he

27
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,359
always stops you know he doesn't what

28
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,460
about that time with the two boats hmm

29
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:06,960
interesting that the pilot picks that

30
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,030
situation as a time Batman stopped the

31
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:10,500
Joker since it was the people on the

32
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,670
boats who decided not to blow each other

33
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,409
up and Batman had nothing to do with it

34
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:15,479
Batman's never gonna see it coming like

35
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:17,220
that time with a parade the prince music

36
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,750
again kind of an interesting situation

37
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,970
to bring up since Joker told everyone on

38
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,100
TV that parade was happening also while

39
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,659
I recognize this movie is making fun of

40
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:26,130
all the iterations of the Joker as if

41
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:27,750
they're all one continuous story I'd

42
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,250
like to be that dickhead who brings up

43
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,780
the fact that Joker died in the Tim

44
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,560
Burton Batman this is referencing you

45
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,060
know kudos to this movie for bringing

46
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,560
back Billy Dee Williams to play to face

47
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,000
when the studio decided to go with Tommy

48
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,280
Lee Jones back in 1995 I don't move to

49
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,350
since but I'm going to add one back for

50
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,579
still not giving him a good number of

51
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:45,060
lines

52
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,130
apparently it's 23 degrees in Gotham but

53
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:48,299
everyone I've seen in the movie so far

54
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:50,130
decided to just wear long sleeves and

55
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,780
pants outside except for the extremely

56
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,159
smart Commissioner Gordon you want to

57
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:54,780
get nuts 20% of this movie is called

58
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,610
back to previous Batman thanks beautiful

59
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:57,600
where's the bomb

60
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,159
but Joker already told you where the

61
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:01,439
bomb was right it was on freakin TV is

62
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,390
this seem funny yes is Batman's

63
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,040
literally playing a guitar in the middle

64
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,530
of fighting crime yes yes he is you

65
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:09,060
think you might grid his enemy yes

66
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,459
you're obsessed with me this humorous

67
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:13,080
conversation about Joker trying to get

68
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,650
Batman to

69
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:14,849
recognize their relationship actually

70
00:02:14,849 --> 00:02:16,709
takes way longer than the time we saw

71
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:18,750
remaining on the bomb hey I know this is

72
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,950
a Batman spoof and literally nothing

73
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:22,159
matters but since I sent you mean

74
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:25,079
nothing to me neither does this bomb

75
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:26,610
which exploded 20 seconds ago according

76
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:29,459
to the unforgiving nature of time these

77
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:32,730
helicopters doing backflips Jesus how

78
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:33,840
many people were standing around a power

79
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,159
plant that was about to explode

80
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:36,720
isn't this on an island these are all

81
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,120
cops and plant workers are they hmm on

82
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,439
the shoulders ticker tape parade

83
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:42,209
celebrating Batman this is like no

84
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:43,290
Gotham I've ever seen before

85
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:46,019
Gotham hates Batman he's a vigilante box

86
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:48,150
a Batmobile exhaust fire kills hundreds

87
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,920
film at 11:00 despite all the future

88
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,569
tech in existence Batman's elevator is

89
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:54,180
slowest microwaving Lobster rich loner

90
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,739
or not great movie gag or not

91
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:58,049
microwaving lobsters for suckers yes it

92
00:02:58,049 --> 00:02:59,400
is hilarious that Batman will have an

93
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,319
entire navy of vehicles but wow that

94
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:02,909
hilariousness washes over you consider

95
00:03:02,909 --> 00:03:04,439
this he waited two minutes while the

96
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:05,970
lobster reheated in the microwave then

97
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:07,799
carried that reheated lobster on a tray

98
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:09,510
while he got on a jet ski and powered

99
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:11,310
the thing out of dock 23 feet then

100
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:15,599
stopped to eat a lobster yeah but where

101
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,500
are the amps for this guitar okay so

102
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,970
Batman sat down to watch Jerry Maguire

103
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,530
the thing is almost over

104
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:23,790
admit it you just wanted the most famous

105
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:25,169
scene to show up so everyone would know

106
00:03:25,169 --> 00:03:28,799
what it is didn't you didn't you Lego

107
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,720
Batman is a freaking dick to Alfred

108
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,030
three fireplaces in one Wayne Manor room

109
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:35,669
really only three fireplaces where's the

110
00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:37,379
fireplace for the fireplace since we're

111
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:39,599
in lego exaggeration movie I seen you go

112
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,540
through similar phases in 2016 in 2012

113
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:46,799
and 2008 and 2005 1997 1995 1992 with

114
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,819
1989 and that weird one in 1966 believe

115
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:52,379
me while I'm laughing my ass off the

116
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:53,909
Lego Batman movie claims that Batman is

117
00:03:53,909 --> 00:03:56,159
like at least 90 years old that Alfred

118
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,079
must be like 130 or something Lego

119
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:00,000
Batman movie utterly retcons all Wayne

120
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,010
Manor location cannon in a silly pullout

121
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:06,419
joke shot your greatest fear is being a

122
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:07,829
part of a family again

123
00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:10,139
nope that's a stepping stone fear to the

124
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:11,729
real theater which is losing a family

125
00:04:11,729 --> 00:04:12,000
again

126
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,739
Alfred clearly attended the Prometheus

127
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:15,060
school of running away from things on a

128
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:18,030
psychology scholarship no Batman acts

129
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:19,829
like a literal toddler and Alfred just

130
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:21,239
rolls with it because this is regular

131
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:22,680
behavior in this universe and I'm just

132
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,960
saying the Batman just rolled around on

133
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,310
the floor like your asshole two-year-old

134
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,540
nice until he got what he wanted

135
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,800
like your asshole to you old nice

136
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,540
tonight Batman V Superman created a

137
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,370
circumstance where Gotham metropolis are

138
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:36,600
literally a few hundred yards from each

139
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,060
other but this is GCN Gotham City

140
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,290
Network and they have a popular show

141
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:42,630
called metropolis and focus Superman

142
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,430
tell me how do you feel about your

143
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,800
recent banishment of Zod to the Phantom

144
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,420
Zone the movie brings this up to show

145
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,590
that Superman cares about his

146
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:51,630
relationship with Zod unlike Batman with

147
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,370
the Joker but wouldn't Lex Luthor be

148
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:55,410
Superman's Joker and the movie Zod is

149
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:57,210
the one Superman always kills Lex Luthor

150
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:58,590
always ends up in jail or an asylum

151
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,420
always coming back for more and failing

152
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,430
time and again like Joker does it's not

153
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:03,930
a Batman movie if Tony Stark doesn't

154
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,550
attend some over-the-top garish party of

155
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:06,870
some kind but all the kids in the

156
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,700
orphanage call me dick well children can

157
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,550
be cruel why does Lego Dick Grayson need

158
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:13,110
a human being sighs pen to take notes

159
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,940
that pen is almost as tall as he is

160
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,130
we've gathered here tonight to mark the

161
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:19,410
retirement of Jim Gordon yeah but you've

162
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:21,030

new police commissioner no one except in

167
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:28,950
Gotham City apparently also this is

168
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,540
Barbara Gordon daughter of Jim Gordon

169
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,770
and yet this movie too spent time

170
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:33,060
showing me Bruce fall in love at first

171
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,890
sight with her suggesting Bruce Jim

172
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:36,720
Gordon's ally for decades has somehow

173
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,250
never seen Gordon's daughter before this

174
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,540
evening which is ludicrous

175
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,160
the same time all the bullet points

176
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,600
listed on this slide are solid black

177
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,430
lines also the new commissioners plan

178
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,930
includes three normal things and

179
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:48,180
ninjutsu which microsoft word doesn't

180
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,650
even think is a real word he hasn't

181
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:50,670
captured Riddler

182
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:54,990
he hasn't captured Bane and this is

183
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:56,070
easily the best part of the movie

184
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,480
pointing out that Batman actually

185
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,800
doesn't do a lot of things to actually

186
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,550
stop crying

187
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:00,990
everyone's reactions around him are

188
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,610
killer this deserves a good three sins

189
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:04,680
off luckily for Joker and his get all

190
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,030
the super villains to surrender plan

191
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,890
they all decided to stand in an easily

192
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:09,510
boxa Bulow so that they could be

193
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:14,850
gift-wrapped for the good guys she

194
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:16,380
definitely upped the Miranda rights

195
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,970
thereby basically leaving out all but

196
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,410
the first line thereby ensuring all

197
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:20,490
these criminals will go free with a

198
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:25,530
half-decent we're also the only reason

199
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:27,150
this Batman all alone black and white

200
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:28,740
moment uses one as the loneliest number

201
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,390
is because Arrested Development had

202
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,190
already used sound of silence the young

203
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:34,110
orphan you adopted at the gala

204
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:36,150
remember Gotham's adoption requirements

205
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,200
are probably the worst thing about the

206
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,970
city as Batman somehow adopts this kid

207
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:40,560
with a distracted verbal agreement but

208
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:40,950
did not

209
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,180
acquire papers to be signed or

210
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,420
interviews to be conducted Lego Batman

211
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,760
Magic Mike I the didn't Batman just turn

212
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,900
this into the batplane in the first

213
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,340
place I mean they're going to the

214
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,110
fortress of solitude so that should have

215
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:53,760
been vehicle number one why did they

216
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,500
park so far away now you got to make you

217
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,180
a to the atomic caldron and get that

218
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,040
Phantom Zone projector it seems kind of

219
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,900
weird that Superman keeps the pz p in

220
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,550
this mission impossible esque fault at

221
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:03,690
the fortress of solitude

222
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,160
looks pretty inconvenient for him if he

223
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,930
ever has to use it and not like he has

224
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:08,340
it on him every time he goes to fight

225
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:11,160
crime as in this small Midwestern frail

226
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,410
bird Hey Robins are a robust species

227
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:14,910
surviving in multiple varied climates

228
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:16,830
that other dainty birds can't stand back

229
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,210
off the Robin bird and just make your

230
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:20,220
jokes about how Robin the character is

231
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,750
lame goofy and stupid leave the bird

232
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,370
alone it's absolutely unreal that

233
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:24,570
Superman went through all that trouble

234
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,760
to protect his pzp but doesn't have any

235
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,990
alarms that go off when it's actually

236
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,310
taken you could learn something from the

237
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:30,660
people who rigged that Boulder booby

238
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,100
trap in Raiders of the Lost Ark

239
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,440
did the Phantom Zone projector go it's

240
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,000
not under Batman or Robin escapes and

241
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,620
just underlines the fact that this item

242
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,700
is impossible to carry around

243
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,530
conveniently and this asshole still

244
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:42,420
doesn't have the pzp until magically

245
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,530
he's apparently been holding it the

246
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:45,390
whole time this is where the movie loses

247
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:47,340
me and starts to just be noise tossing

248
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,480
in the Wicked Witch from Wizard of Oz

249
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,880
Sauron gremlins agents from the matrix

250
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,490
King Kong Baltimore Daleks the first

251
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:54,720
lego movie at least grounded its

252
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,070
weirdness in that it was all the

253
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,810
imagination of a real human child this

254
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,130
movie just throws everything it can

255
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:00,540
think of into the mix and expects you to

256
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,250
applaud the randomness also in a

257
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,480
previous scene we heard about Superman

258
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,100
sending Zod to the Phantom Zone where

259
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,990
that asshole you were going to say

260
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,250
something about recruiting the

261
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,320
universe's greatest villains to conquer

262
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,260
a superhero how the ever-loving do you

263
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,030
cast the actual Baltimore in this movie

264
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:16,590
as Alfred but then hire someone else to

265
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:18,420
voice Baltimore it's the weirdest

266
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:20,010
casting decision since Courtney Love in

267
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:22,080
anything I love Eddie Izzard but the

268
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,490
movie misses out on some great medaka

269
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:25,320
acts with this choice why would the

270
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,270
Phantom Zone Gunn even have a release

271
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,190
all inmates setting and that's beyond

272
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,630
the question of why Superman even needs

273
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:32,490
a goddamn space gun to send bad guys to

274
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:36,930
the zone in the first place with a knife

275
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:39,490
or jewelry give it up

276
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:41,920
look I like this movie but this one by

277
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,810
one late-night talk-show introduction of

278
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:45,130
all the Phantom Zone villains is just

279
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:46,990
for us the audience literally makes no

280
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,400
sense in the universe of the movie that

281
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,690
the Joker would do this or that the

282
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:50,980
villains will all agree - we patient

283
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,690
need to escape back to earth so everyone

284
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:54,010
could have a proper introduction to the

285
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:58,840
humans of Gotham jeez all the

286
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,950
Superfriends dognition

287
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,840
I'm rubbing my butt all over your stuff

288
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,970
we're gonna have to rename this the butt

289
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:05,530
mobile smoothie had at least five

290
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:07,090
screenwriters but none of them are able

291
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:08,980
to stop this be lazy Joe from making it

292
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,570
into the final script they do get a

293
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:12,280
bunch of criminals together to fight the

294
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,990
criminals that's a stupid idea

295
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:16,030
haha for the self-awareness but too bad

296
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,350
Lego Batman wasn't the head of the

297
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:19,210
studio when they made Suicide Squad this

298
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:21,010
movie just got way more transformers and

299
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:22,270
furious than I think an attendant

300
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,340
somehow Joker had the time materials and

301
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,720
construction workers to turn Wayne Manor

302
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,550
into a theme park and in a movie with

303
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:30,280
King Kong lava-spewing Sauron and Bing

304
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,140
talking velociraptors the flying monkeys

305
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,610
from Oz will now make some kind of

306
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:35,320
impact did Batman even fix the plane

307
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,120
while he was out there maybe he did but

308
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,010
so it's running on one thing engine and

309
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:43,120
just got hit by lightning even though

310
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,740
this movie is silly and you can't take

311
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,330
even a smidgen of it seriously it

312
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:47,530
illustrates the problem with too many

313
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:48,940
villains a lot of these assholes could

314
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,560
end the world on their own but the movie

315
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,730
loses them when they're all working

316
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:52,180
together

317
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,860
sure killing sour on is great but you

318
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,870
still have Baltimore a Kraken King Kong

319
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,640
and others out there and you couldn't be

320
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,750
bothered to make a joke about killing

321
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,430
Sauron by throwing the One Ring into the

322
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:01,840
fires of Mount Doom so many ways you

323
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,130
could have gone with that but you went

324
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:08,260
with the blue fireball round Batman's

325
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,610
dead parents are about to ruin another

326
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,200
movie this whole thing is beginning to

327
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,370
feel a lot like the ending of Kung Fu

328
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:15,160
Panda 3 to me

329
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,440
Phylis shows Batman the very recent bad

330
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,270
things he's done and nothing from before

331
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,920
which is emotionally convenient to the

332
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:24,280
plot Joker you mean nothing to me

333
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,740
seriously his feelings toward Joker are

334
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,050
considered bad by the Phantom Zone pink

335
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:31,480
Phantom Zone I can't let you go my boss

336
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,220
will be really mad at me so if there's

337
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,630
this kind of hierarchy at work in the

338
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:36,430
Phantom Zone how was the pzp able to

339
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:38,110
unleash all the bad guys a few minutes

340
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:41,140
ago listen I just wanted to say that I'm

341
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,350
really really really every last Batman

342
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:46,090
probably has a hard time saying sorry

343
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:48,370
but even for comedic effect get on with

344
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:50,400
it already that's why I called in backup

345
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,200
flip flip flip flip

346
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,210
- Batman call all the bad guys which was

347
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:55,680
a stupid idea of course it's not the

348
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,150
Superfriends are the Superfriends

349
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,800
Justice League not a group of heroes the

350
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,390
Batman needs to curry favor with that

351
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,830
someone is defeating a crackin thing

352
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:03,060
with a giant hammer says a lot about

353
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:06,900
this movie Voldemort is trying to use

354
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,390
the pzp instead of you know magic to win

355
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,100
+ wouldn't the Phantom Zone just let

356
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:11,970
them come back anyway

357
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:15,570
shut up Joker if there's no Gotham then

358
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:17,880
I'll never get to fight you again this

359
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,470
Batman Joker fighting relationship an

360
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,790
amusing substitute for a loving

361
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,290
relationship officially goes too far

362
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:24,330
even in a comedy if Joker's sole purpose

363
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:26,040
is to get recognition from Batman then

364
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,300
what's the point of conjuring up evil

365
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,470
plans anymore once he gets that

366
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,090
recognition the plan to keep the two

367
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,620
plates that so Gotham together by using

368
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,140
sheer brute strength works we need all

369
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,930
of you to join us and help bring this

370
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,220
city back together

371
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,650
Oh is he broadcasting that and goddamn

372
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:42,000
every person in Gotham must be the

373
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,500
bravest mother for her dad ever lived to

374
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,210
go along with his plan I made a promise

375
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:47,850
I gotta go back to the Phantom Zone

376
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:50,070
why isn't Superman notices pzp is

377
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:51,810
missing yet Jesus show the part where

378
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:53,070
he's saying show me the money at least

379
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:56,610
all important movies end with a white

380
00:11:56,610 --> 00:12:05,360
screen that's racist

381
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,540
[Music]

382
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,290
sometimes takes a little pack of

383
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:11,150
mayonnaise until squirt in their mouth

384
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:12,650
over and then she'll take an egg and

385
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:25,399
kind of she calls anim an egg

386
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:27,930
we have to stick together taken together

387
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:35,040
is what good waffles do chance of total

388
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:45,449
mission failure is 110 percent real acid

389
00:12:45,449 --> 00:12:50,279
this is the illusion Michael trick is

390
00:12:50,279 --> 00:13:01,500
something up or does for money Lego

391
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,970
Batman is not great with the healthy

392
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:03,630
snacking

393
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:05,490
I mean Batman eats microwaved leftover

394
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:06,779
lobster in the first 10 minutes of the

395
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:08,459
film that's like hitting the food

396
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:14,579
rock-bottom how much better would Lego

397
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:16,170
Batman be at his job if he had a steady

398
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,000
supply of healthy nutritious energy

399
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,620
