going to be the greatest event this week

80
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,460
[Music]

81
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:09,530
definitely on the side

82
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:11,780
so here's the concept she's going to

83
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,330
have loaner this bright orange bronco

84
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:17,360
park it in front of her shop during the

85
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,070
event Thursday night and then on the

86
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:21,590
side it's going to say Billy company

87
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:27,860
vehicle five inches 6 inches 7 inches I

88
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:41,930
think they've got a tape measure it

89
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,490
should always be bigger than you think

90
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:45,590
father this is not mine my lips look

91
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:49,160
like it but personally I would have gone

92
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,380
with the Lamborghini here but Candace

93
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,550
and I have different tastes

94
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:54,920
thank you Sarah for having me thanks for

95
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,990
loaning my wife your car I'll see you in

96
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,150
a couple of days the way that that

97
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,950
operation works there is you have to be

98
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,840
a member of that Club but if you

99
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,760
remember you can borrow any of those

100
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,400
cars whenever you want I don't know why

101
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,020
anyone alone want to be a member of a

102
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,780

00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:22,620

136
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:26,880
[Music]

137
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,230
are you excited or nervous about the

138
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:31,960
party I service because when you get

139
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,520
involved I get nervous if you put all

140
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,010
these expectations on me I know are all

141
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:41,229
party that was not the response I was

142
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:56,770
expecting kind of naively realizing

143
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:58,570
right now as I finish this edit that a

144
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:01,420
lot of you might be wondering if you can

145
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:05,380
come to the party on Thursday night the

146
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:07,870
answer for me is yes but the answer from

147
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:10,900
campus is probably no it's a small space

148
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,040
and she's going to have her like

149
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,020
magazine editors and important people

150
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:17,080
for her new business there but I mean

151
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,880
I'll be there if you want to come say hi

152
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,500
take a selfie in the street or something

153
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,280
like that I'll be there with my

154
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,470
skateboard I don't think that Jeremy

155
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:25,960
should have enough time to tattoo all of

156
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,420
you

157
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:35,090
