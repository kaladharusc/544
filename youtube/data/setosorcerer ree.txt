got a question do we actually loose in a

233
00:12:34,269 --> 00:12:37,360
way yeah there was baloney there's no

234
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,740
winning it's like it's like game theory

235
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:41,040
like healy and I came to here was called

236
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,860
darn anything in the stupid scenario I

237
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:49,149
always lose doesn't learn anyway so that

238
00:12:49,149 --> 00:12:52,209
was a lien in space that's pretty good I

239
00:12:52,209 --> 00:12:54,490
like it in a candy coma yeah

240
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:55,980
pretty much it was pretty good for a

241
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:59,110
2014 map rises the left command block

242
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:01,420
type thingy so do you think there could

243
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,670
be a potential master like this but

244
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:05,500
hopefully better in terms of Oh what the

245
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,790
hell yeah I could take um armory that's

246
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:10,450
right take out hopefully stuff like this

247
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:11,950
that has been improved with command

248
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:14,529
blocks and stuff and the you know ears

249
00:13:14,529 --> 00:13:18,430
