1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:12,179
welcome to my favorite video to make

2
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:12,840
ever

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:18,150
it's Halloween y'all the second annual

4
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,270
my dogs try on Halloween costumes

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,550
what is it as you know last week I made

6
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,890
myself a beautiful toothbrush costume

7
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,109
which is now becoming resident of our

8
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:30,029
living room there's a limitation as to

9
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:32,730
how many new dog costumes come out in a

10
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:34,590
year without me making them so I did the

11
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,390
best that I could but I'm excited for

12
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:37,410
some of these I think that they're

13
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:39,660
really great a miss wheet what do you

14
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,879
think since you're here we'll start with

15
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:44,280
you my dogs don't really mind this like

16
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,260
I wouldn't say that they like it but I

17
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,570
don't really care right it's the one day

18
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,640
of the year when I don't care about your

19
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,920
feelings you're gonna look cute and

20
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,079
you're gonna like it I'm gonna start

21
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:56,820
with a costume that I wouldn't say is my

22
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,199
favorite but I think it's gonna look

23
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:00,719
really pretty on you she's look excited

24
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,940
do you want to dress up Wow high quality

25
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,489
already coming apart very excited we had

26
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:08,430
to get you a medium baby girl because

27
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,500
although you are technically a small dog

28
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,420
girl you a medium you know what I'm

29
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,400
saying that's not a bad thing you just

30
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,630
thickened long

31
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:18,960
oh it's also hard to shop I'm sure for

32
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,119
those of you that have dogs or cats I

33
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,049
don't know what you're into like

34
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:24,210
sometimes your pet is like a weird shape

35
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,340
like she's just very long this is what

36
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,009
I'm talking about this is for a dog this

37
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:31,560
is the shape of her head a bicycle seat

38
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,630
what are we gonna do here features

39
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,070
probably the only dog that we have that

40
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,150
while we're giving out candy to

41
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:37,740
trick-or-treaters she's allowed to come

42
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,329
outside and be with us because you're

43
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:41,820
nice to children and strangers she looks

44
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:45,180
elegant from the back toe down in the

45
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,470
back you're a ladybug what do you think

46
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,030
I would

47
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,710
maybe like a second there's something

48
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,810
crying on the floor I would score this

49
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,400
maybe like a seven out of ten maybe

50
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,380
because of the fit I would have to do

51
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,509
some alterations in order to get it to

52
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:01,979
really look beautiful on her

53
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:03,630
but she can't really move in it it's

54
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,490
this can you move in your drive so not

55
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:08,039
just the Jess it still reads ladybug

56
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:10,800
just the same not having it all right

57
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,660
peachy let's move on to your next one

58
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,209
because peach and Carmen are legally

59
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:16,800
bound they are actually married in case

60
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,510
you didn't see that video that happened

61
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,459
a while ago I married my dogs it was a

62
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:22,110
day that we all needed it was right

63
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,880
after the presidential election whatever

64
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,400
y'all are married I got them a couple of

65
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,010
couples costumes this is one of them

66
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:31,739
this is cat dog it's a cartoon from when

67
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:34,019
I was younger I got one for peach and

68
00:02:34,019 --> 00:02:35,160
one for Kermit

69
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,910
so you guys connect sit up I said

70
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:41,970
sit up it's like a trying to address a

71
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:43,709
tomato oh sorry honey

72
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:47,370
oh my god you look beautiful though

73
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,980
honey I know it feels kind of weird but

74
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:53,480
you'll get used to it

75
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,950
she goes Wow

76
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,780
not really great for the movability is

77
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:07,320
it you know what it's not your turn yet

78
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,720
but I have a cat dog costume just for

79
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:15,750
you if you want it that's it god she's

80
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,940
going anywhere you literally asked for

81
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:22,970
this Kermit

82
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,760
the Lakotas legs what you wanted

83
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,440
sometimes you don't know why you're

84
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,940
crying and this is what you're crying

85
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,100
for are you happy pleased with yourself

86
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:43,560
Wow but I would give this like a pretty

87
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,110
high score like a seven or an eight good

88
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:47,460
calm on the costumes

89
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,010
yeah our dogs don't like the leg straps

90
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:53,400
and or all of the stuff things going on

91
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,930
so I don't think that they'll move too

92
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:57,540
much in them for laughing purposes so

93
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,830
just put your dog in something awesome

94
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:00,210
yeah these are great

95
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:02,850
it is time for your second the last

96
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:05,040
costume but they're both the same thing

97
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,130
because I found one pretty mermaid

98
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,140
costume and I thought that was so pretty

99
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:13,320
but then I found an even better mermaid

100
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,049
costume so chances are you're gonna end

101
00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:17,910
up being an actual mermaid for Halloween

102
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:20,459
which one we don't know yet Kermit

103
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:22,470
honestly how did you get up here first

104
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,480
of all and second of all what this is

105
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,640
not only you crap like you're Sebastian

106
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:30,750
but it's a toy - oh you look so

107
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,690
beautiful honey all right can't you keep

108
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,220
that one of mine because I think that

109
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,480
you like that one because it's pretty

110
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,669
functional in shape and size and stuff

111
00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:40,620
but I got you one that you probably

112
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,380
won't like but I'll like better

113
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,780
which means you're gonna be down keep in

114
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,880
mind bitch what do you think about this

115
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:53,790
little mermaid so last year we had some

116
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,500
choices for marble that I think we're a

117
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,930
little bit too much I think you forgot

118
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:00,090
where you were for the majority of that

119
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:02,580
time so I got you some more like

120
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:05,400
functional outfits that aren't going to

121
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,320
overwhelm you picked out some choices

122
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,030
for you that are like a little

123
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:11,430
understated but so festive what do you

124
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:14,850
think about that wonderful the first one

125
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:17,460
that I got you marble is a little shark

126
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,320
because I think that you would look so

127
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,550
cute and it also matches your

128
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:29,599
buying personality oh wow it's a great

129
00:05:29,599 --> 00:05:32,210
white shark it's a little less

130
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:34,099
overwhelming than the other ones and

131
00:05:34,099 --> 00:05:36,349
you're still kind of falling over is it

132
00:05:36,349 --> 00:05:39,590
in your eyes can you see are you there

133
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:44,539
oh there he goes Wow okay he can move in

134
00:05:44,539 --> 00:05:47,330
it very cute with the hood back I like

135
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:54,770
it a lot you put the Scrat Kermit you

136
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:56,360
know what happens when you cry don't

137
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,460
test me boy he's standing in the

138
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,229
costumes you know what those are they're

139
00:06:00,229 --> 00:06:14,150
gonna go on your body you scared him

140
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:23,300
Carmen he can't find it it's time to

141
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:30,009
stop cuz you can't really see oh okay

142
00:06:30,009 --> 00:06:33,560
okay okay so this costume will go cute

143
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,840
and pretty functional is still pretty

144
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,060
scary so we're gonna pass on this one

145
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:41,719
huh let's try this cute one come here

146
00:06:41,719 --> 00:06:46,279
you little lion Oh see that's a good hug

147
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:48,259
for you because your head can still be

148
00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:56,389
out huh Marvel oh you okay my boo blink

149
00:06:56,389 --> 00:06:57,949
once if you can hear me

150
00:06:57,949 --> 00:07:00,289
oh no you blinked twice what does that

151
00:07:00,289 --> 00:07:03,199
mean mumble mumble can you walk around

152
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:09,199
oh oh yeah it works when you're sitting

153
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,460
up but not so much when you wake up okay

154
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:15,919
what if we put it behind your head so we

155
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:19,370
have the essence with the functionality

156
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:23,730
of your head Oh

157
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:27,570
my Annie what are you Oh little

158
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:32,790
top-heavy oh you can do it

159
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:43,230
Wow there you go I think that this is

160
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:47,040
pretty good very cute but the hood just

161
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:51,240
you know the last one that I got you I'm

162
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,180
hoping will be very functional and not

163
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,740
stress you out it's like a little

164
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:59,070
vampire costume the accents of red are
