between you and I have very very

25
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:30,710
different interpretations on what

one on the NES you know how many hours

67
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:00,359
of my life

68
00:04:00,359 --> 00:04:04,680
you wasted with it home alone a

69
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,350
franchise based entirely off this space

70
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:09,150
see this one's a classic didn't know

71
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,470
what they were doing first one's got the

72
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,600
face second one got away from the face

73
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,040
yeah you can't get away from the face

74
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,690
third one didn't have the face and

75
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:17,160
that's why Jonathan Taylor Thomas said

76
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,359
whoever the fuck this is didn't have

77
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:20,190
such a good time around number four they

78
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,510
realized what they were doing wrong that

79
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,340
the face bag got the face gone ratings

80
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,690
skyrocketed but see the problem with

81
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:26,810
this one they got Ernest in this one

82
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:28,650
trying to do bring him back from the

83
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:31,240
dead that's disrespectful five

84
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,690
as this was the class the holiday high

85
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:39,970
stuff of bad things it's beautiful

86
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:41,860
this one's for the criterion collection

87
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,509
they even got Malcolm McDowell I'm sure

88
00:04:43,509 --> 00:04:44,680
they walked up to a minute they have to

89
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,810
do any explaining he said I'm Malcolm

90
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:48,310
McDowell and I've worked the greatest I

91
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,660
work with Kubrick I've been a clockwork

92
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,370
orange' beat the fuck out of my house he

93
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:52,960
asked me if I'd do a holiday night would

94
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,910
you ask me do you want the best caviar

95
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:57,069
on the planet you know I asked you man a

96
00:04:57,069 --> 00:04:58,660
question like that get the fuck out of

97
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,610
my mansion the later home alone films

98
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,349
were just cash ins on the series but the

99
00:05:02,349 --> 00:05:03,699
first two were actually really good

100
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:05,560
films they were written by John Hughes

101
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,360
directed by Chris Columbus would go on

102
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,919
to make the first two Harry Potter films

103
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:10,569
hilariously and guy only goes in twos

104
00:05:10,569 --> 00:05:12,610
and the music was composed by the one

105
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:15,039
and only John Williams so naturally they

106
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,449
made a bunch of games to capitalize on

107
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:18,250
the height do any of them stand to

108
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,080
capture the childlike and whimsical

109
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,909
essence of the film's let's find out

110
00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:23,349
because apparently that's the first step

111
00:05:23,349 --> 00:05:25,030
to get my bird back according to the

112
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,560
actor of the titular films Macaulay

113
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,560
Culkin wears have pasty s Skeletor

114
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,909
motherfuckers he getting his ectoplasm

115
00:05:30,909 --> 00:05:32,650
will make toothbrushes what a fucking

116
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:34,720
guy let's take a look at home alone one

117
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,810
for the NES first what this game is made

118
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:42,789
by Bethesda like Skyrim Bethesda yeah it

119
00:05:42,789 --> 00:05:45,130
actually is the same Bethesda that made

120
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:47,949
Skyrim and fallout 3 made home alone one

121
00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:51,250
for the Ness weird in this game

122
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,110
unsurprisingly you play is Kevin and

123
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:55,270
wander around your house without parents

124
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,740
I guess I mean come on you got to give

125
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,030
him some credit that's pretty true to

126
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:59,949
the film's core message ah look at this

127
00:05:59,949 --> 00:06:02,110
they got people walking by I didn't know

128
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,759
they had AI street tech in the nineteen

129
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,069
oh Jesus he's at my house okay so that's

130
00:06:06,069 --> 00:06:08,110
terrifying in the movies the villains

131
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:09,580
are in it for the valuables but here

132
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,710
they seem to be only interested in Kevin

133
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:13,030
Ware's Chris Hansen and that

134
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:14,680
suspiciously benign plate of cookies

135
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,449
when you need them you know I don't want

136
00:06:16,449 --> 00:06:17,740
this cookie I just want to get to the

137
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,670
feet come in just one second

138
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:22,350
[Music]

139
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:25,720
yeah that's just about right that's

140
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,940
appropriate a boy is captured and will

141
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,530
likely be found dead in the coming weeks

142
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:32,229
and all you got his own no it's got a

143
00:06:32,229 --> 00:06:36,520
good message so the point of the game

144
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,110
and I'm being generous here with that

145
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:39,940
statement seems to be walk around pick

146
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,410
up random objects and place them as

147
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:43,660
traps to halt the kidnappers completely

148
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,340
tell what's going on in this game you

149
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,470
got stuff like spider toy car

150
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:50,169
what's this potato did I just pick up a

151
00:06:50,169 --> 00:06:52,750
fucking potato to stop robbers oh well

152
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,160
there's the light bulb for it at least

153
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,020
that's good now I can knock them out

154
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,240
with my impressive science skills brings

155
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,030
new home potato security are those are

156
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:03,580
those nails why can't I pick these up

157
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:06,070
there are real robbers in my house there

158
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:08,229
are real hardened criminals in my house

159
00:07:08,229 --> 00:07:10,419
and about I'm pretty sure nails would be

160
00:07:10,419 --> 00:07:14,919
infinitely more useful than potato I see

161
00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:16,389
Michael Jackson made such a big impact

162
00:07:16,389 --> 00:07:17,919
on Macaulay Culkin they put the moonwalk

163
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,919
in the game let's grab the spider cuz

164
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:22,210
you know that's not completely

165
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:24,940
terrifying or anything Oh should put

166
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:27,110
down put that put down dog

167
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:28,919
[Music]

168
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:31,690
then I just rip up that robber with a

169
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:34,659
spider and then do a moonwalk that's it

170
00:07:34,659 --> 00:07:40,020
this is the best game ever

171
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,590
[Music]

172
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:44,640
okay even though this is clearly just

173
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,770
hmm one of the most sublime games ever

174
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:48,210
created I'm gonna go ahead and try to

175
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:50,100
nitpick a bit I think I'll start with

176
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,900
what the hell is going on with anything

177
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,090
the perspective is completely bonkers

178
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:56,490
what's going on what's this what am i

179
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:58,740
standing on is that my house is that

180
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,210
another house across the street or is

181
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:03,630
that a subterranean lair home alone well

182
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:06,420
this is more akin to a mobius strip it's

183
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,550
like a Klein bottle up in here he's

184
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:10,080
better uh filling up with hot tar

185
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,840
pouring all those pesky intruders if

186
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,070
that wasn't enough for you and your

187
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,990
entire lineage they also made home alone

188
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:21,000
too lost in New York this musics given

189
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,380
me a fever dream of Macaulay Culkin's

190
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:25,470
goddamn gremlin head back get a nanny in

191
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:29,340
memory of Tom hype poor bastard the last

192
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,230
thing this guy worked on in his life all

193
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:34,020
the things he did just funneled down the

194
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,720
home alone too on the NES for his sake I

195
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,540
hope it's better than home alone one I

196
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:41,340
guess this is supposed to be Tim Curry's

197
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,750
character given that he plays the

198
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,340
concierge that's after Kevin in the

199
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,420
movie hmm

200
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,260
Tim you've been eating your vegetables

201
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:50,040
you know look yourself literally at all

202
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,200
so right off the bat this game is a lot

203
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,030
better than the last one take that for

204
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:55,380
what you will at least you're just

205
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,180
dealing with left and right no the

206
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,100
theoretical physics in this version but

207
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,690
that doesn't mean they put much thought

208
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:02,880
into it as you can see they've got into

209
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,980
painstaking detail to recreate Kevin

210
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,260
McCallister signature goiter humph

211
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,420
you can almost smell the ointment I

212
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:15,930
don't know what he put on boy let's not

213
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,160
forget the real star of the show the

214
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:21,780
fact that you can pull this shit and the

215
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:25,470
platoon rescue presence again this game

216
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:27,840
is cod and madness everything wants to

217
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,220
kill you just for the street cred

218
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,680
possessed luggage Frankenstein's monster

219
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,260
bloody mops even witch's who's running

220
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:34,860
this hotel

221
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:35,800
the

222
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,380
Adams family let me tell you in my

223
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,390
experience only to cut old ladies to

224
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,260
move like that

225
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,540
retired Russian Olympians and ho inches

226
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,680
you see right there

227
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,620
that's a parabola now only wish to pull

228
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,089
up a parabola of this nature

229
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,769
I think this establishments got bigger

230
00:09:50,769 --> 00:09:52,149
problems on its hands than Kevin

231
00:09:52,149 --> 00:09:53,620
McCallister running around with a fake

232
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,420
credit card the main point of this game

233
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,130
seems to be to make a mad dash to the

234
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,540
end of the level but when you get there

235
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,399
the elevator doors are closed I don't

236
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,230
know what to do you can get these what

237
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:04,120
appear to be a necklace of pearls I

238
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,680
guess we might as well try to take out

239
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,880
some of the enemies with it maybe

240
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,920
that'll lead us in the right direction

241
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,279
BAM

242
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,350
not well okay that didn't do anything

243
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:13,269
okay I guess it's more of a trap than a

244
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:15,490
projectile gotta use the old McAllister

245
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,839
wits here come here

246
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:25,180
Chubby Checker time to do a twist he

247
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,529
just walked right over my beads like it

248
00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:27,970
was nothing yeah I hate this game it

249
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:29,380
doesn't even let me have fun when I try

250
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,690
this game automatically goes on my shit

251
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:34,060
list because T's kill you

252
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,399
what kind of sadism is this these are

253
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,230
deeply rooted conventions man you don't

254
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:40,029
mess with this stuff and this game came

255
00:10:40,029 --> 00:10:41,440
out way after things like Legend of

256
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,480
Zelda all right they had time it turns

257
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,190
out you're actually supposed to bang on

258
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:46,750
the elevator button a bunch of times to

259
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,700
get the elevator to come which I guess

260
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,500
is about accurate I mean usually when

261
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,610
you're trying to call an elevator you

262
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:54,399
just do it like this is a video game

263
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,380
though how was I supposed to know I had

264
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,420
to wait for the elevator this isn't some

265
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,880
experimental indie game it gave me no

266
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,430
indication it was even coming let's move

267
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:05,260
on to the SNES that's one of my favorite

268
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:07,029
systems it's gotta be at home along game

269
00:11:07,029 --> 00:11:09,459
on man huh that's better already

270
00:11:09,459 --> 00:11:11,440
decent graphics and at least it plays

271
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,810
like an actual video game whoa hold up

272
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:15,430
look at that giant emerald ring on the

273
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,020
dresser over there you could pawn that

274
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,970
off and buy Kenya it's no wonder people

275
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,680
are trying to rob this guy's house all

276
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,870
the time okay first stuff up who who was

277
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,699
this cartoon mobster here and why does

278
00:11:24,699 --> 00:11:26,649
no one care that he's in my house is

279
00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:28,329
he's just a weird family member is he my

280
00:11:28,329 --> 00:11:31,180
dad is it was my cousin my game dad also

281
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,320
I'd just like to point out that this

282
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,350
bowling ball placement is exquisite

283
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:39,230
[Music]

284
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:41,880
so basically the point of this fun kids

285
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,400
SNES game is to run around and collect

286
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,170
valuables from your house and then when

287
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:47,760
you collect them deposit them into these

288
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,550
safes which drop the items into a sex

289
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,740
dungeon what is the significance of this

290
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,230
is that a giant vault in their basement

291
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:57,270
who has a giant vault in their basement

292
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:59,339
I really have no idea why I'm supposed

293
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:01,890
to do this I can't figure it out if you

294
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:03,990
can't figure out how to play home alone

295
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:07,350
one on the Smiths right away what it's

296
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:09,690
bad its Bree do the game throne without

297
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:12,120
redo the fucking game also for some

298
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,130
reason every item you deposit always

299
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:16,770
turns into a candelabra was Liberace the

300
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,360
executive producer for this game is

301
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,760
something seriously why I'm picking up

302
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,589
emerald rings sex of money but it always

303
00:12:22,589 --> 00:12:25,320
turns into my golden candelabra why does

304
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,510
it always turn into a candelabra

305
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:33,740
[Music]

306
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,310
okay soos

307
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:36,930
you're gonna tell me that a community of

308
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:39,000
right minded adults made a game about a

309
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,190
ten-year-old boy and then decided that

310
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:42,779
the best course of action would be to

311
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:44,580
have the game over screen be a naked

312
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:47,040
picture of him let it be known that this

313
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,600
is actually the only part of the movie

314
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,160
where it touches his face and screams

315
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,750
and that's what he's applying naked ly

316
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:58,560
aftershave applying it Oh looks like

317
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,020
they caught old Kevin after all his

318
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,970
tricks and toy cars weren't enough to

319
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:04,890
keep the fully grown robbers with more

320
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:06,790
developed brains at bang

321
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:09,970
[Music]

322
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:12,699
is that a single good home loan thing

323
00:13:12,699 --> 00:13:15,100
after home alone to the movie exception

324
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,899
of course set episode of five holiday

325
00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:19,420
heist highly regarded as the strikes

326
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,699
back of the series of course certainly

327
00:13:21,699 --> 00:13:23,379
not the gameboy version it's really just

328
00:13:23,379 --> 00:13:25,180
the same thing as the SNES version with

329
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,769
a few marked improvements that I'll go

330
00:13:26,769 --> 00:13:28,480
over right now but one thing when you

331
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,949
shoot the mobster he turns into michael

332
00:13:29,949 --> 00:13:33,850
jackson moonwalker still got that

333
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:35,199
bowling ball though that's how you know

334
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:37,120
it's authentic maybe there's hope and

335
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,839
home alone - for this next but probably

336
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:44,379
not no hoping year probably ain't no

337
00:13:44,379 --> 00:13:47,560
hope for the life this is exactly the

338
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,209
same game as the one for the NES but

339
00:13:49,209 --> 00:13:51,850
this one has much better JPEG you could

340
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:53,410
tell by the fact that Tim Curry looks

341
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:55,329
like he has less jaundice in this one

342
00:13:55,329 --> 00:13:57,579
but a fortunately they didn't find out

343
00:13:57,579 --> 00:13:59,290
how to make him look like Tim Curry yet

344
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:02,199
oh my god I think they've literally just

345
00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:04,120
cut out Joe Pesci's head and pasted it

346
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,100
on this cartoon body look at the

347
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,050
clipping on the pea coat don't get me

348
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:09,639
started on Daniel Stern hair it looks

349
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:11,350
like he's trying to cork out a hard shit

350
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,579
he's been brewing in his ass for a

351
00:14:12,579 --> 00:14:14,470
couple of weeks most everything here is

352
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,149
the same bar the graphical upgrade

353
00:14:16,149 --> 00:14:19,180
except this lady's different also I

354
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,889
think this bears tripping balls with

355
00:14:20,889 --> 00:14:22,540
that dog down there this is the face of

356
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:36,879
someone who's seen some shit wait there

357
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:40,360
is one more game the rarest game of them

358
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,829
all only released in Europe for the

359
00:14:41,829 --> 00:14:44,199
PlayStation 2 and that's like 10 years

360
00:14:44,199 --> 00:14:46,180
newer than the SNES they must have

361
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,379
figured out how to make a good home

362
00:14:47,379 --> 00:14:49,149
alone game by then I mean they fucked up

363
00:14:49,149 --> 00:14:50,949
every other time you can only fuck up so

364
00:14:50,949 --> 00:14:52,870
many times before someone finds you

365
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:57,100
let's do this I gotta say my best friend

366
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:00,339
oh yeah the 20th Century Fox logo you

367
00:15:00,339 --> 00:15:01,689
always know you're in for something good

368
00:15:01,689 --> 00:15:07,509
when you see that oh oh are you serious

369
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:09,879
is it something that someone who calls

370
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:11,589
himself a professional artist actually

371
00:15:11,589 --> 00:15:13,449
made and handed to their boss and the

372
00:15:13,449 --> 00:15:15,220
boss but yeah that looks good do that oh

373
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:18,670
my god this isn't some sort of hat game

374
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:21,189
this is a real game with real box art

375
00:15:21,189 --> 00:15:23,800
real money that was exchanged by real

376
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,579
people to really fucking own it on

377
00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:29,529
PlayStation 2 oh my god this looks like

378
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:31,209
something you'd see at 11-year old post

379
00:15:31,209 --> 00:15:33,519
on deviantART look at this house now

380
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,230
look at this house bordering the text I

381
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:36,970
could literally make this in Photoshop

382
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:38,860
in like two minutes tops good nah I'll

383
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,449
do it I'll do it right now

384
00:15:40,449 --> 00:15:42,459
I did it I literally that I literally

385
00:15:42,459 --> 00:15:44,139
made the exact same thing with a mouse

386
00:15:44,139 --> 00:15:46,779
and zero experience in art don't you

387
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,730
remember these iconic characters from

388
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:49,389
the film

389
00:15:49,389 --> 00:15:53,800
Kelly Carl Carly

390
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:58,679
my favorite scene with them was this one

391
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:01,389
what is this what am i doing I'm alone

392
00:16:01,389 --> 00:16:03,309
but I'm not in the home I'm in some

393
00:16:03,309 --> 00:16:05,439
Botanical Garden oh so why is this

394
00:16:05,439 --> 00:16:07,420
taking place during summer did anyone on

395
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:09,519
this and I use this phrase loosely team

396
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,110
of developers watch the film before

397
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:13,329
sitting down and making the game I know

398
00:16:13,329 --> 00:16:14,920
they had to put it together in one whole

399
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,899
weekend but damn son that is some

400
00:16:16,899 --> 00:16:18,519
serious commitment to being unfaithful

401
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,679
to your source material you spend more

402
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:22,540
time in this game walking around locking

403
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,279
doors and he do laying traps for the bad

404
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:26,110
guys excuse me if you could turn the

405
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,720
effects down in this game what effects

406
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,209
this game has effects that you can turn

407
00:16:31,209 --> 00:16:33,160
off so basically you go around

408
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,929
attempting to attack the two burglars

409
00:16:34,929 --> 00:16:36,339
with various things you find laying

410
00:16:36,339 --> 00:16:38,170
around my personal favorite is the

411
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:40,300
spider because you just throw a fucking

412
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,939
spider at them you just throw another

413
00:16:42,939 --> 00:16:45,850
living being at their face I can't

414
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:48,279
believe this is a real game it's no

415
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:49,540
wonder they didn't release this game

416
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,429
outside of Europe the boxart

417
00:16:51,429 --> 00:16:55,779
the I mean no exaggeration by this the

418
00:16:55,779 --> 00:16:58,449
box art is literally the best part about

419
00:16:58,449 --> 00:17:00,579
this game how did this happen no

420
00:17:00,579 --> 00:17:03,429
seriously how did this game happen it

421
00:17:03,429 --> 00:17:06,429
was released in 2006 that's like ten

422
00:17:06,429 --> 00:17:08,289
years after home alone was even relevant

423
00:17:08,289 --> 00:17:09,100
anymore

424
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:12,399
why did anyone opt to make this game was

425
00:17:12,399 --> 00:17:13,539
there some sort of interdimensional

426
00:17:13,539 --> 00:17:15,189
being they had to keep it bay by making

427
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:15,720
a new home

428
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,199
loan game well I guess that's it I'll

429
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:20,669
never see Jack again

430
00:17:20,669 --> 00:17:22,949
there's not a single redeemable game in

431
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:28,919
this entire library where you say I can

432
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:32,309
see clearly now the rain is gone come on

433
00:17:32,309 --> 00:17:34,110
come on I must have missed something I

434
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:35,159
mean there was so many different

435
00:17:35,159 --> 00:17:37,909
competing companies back in the 90s

436
00:17:37,909 --> 00:17:39,360
that's it

437
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,059
home alone for Sega Genesis well this

438
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:43,799
may be one of the first times that the

439
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:45,299
Sega versions of the game are better

440
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:47,159
than their SNES counterparts but the

441
00:17:47,159 --> 00:17:48,870
home alone games on Sega are pretty

442
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:50,940
sweet at least compared to the horror

443
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,860
that I just witnessed tight graphics

444
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,289
novel gameplay Kevin looks and controls

445
00:17:55,289 --> 00:17:57,179
just as you'd expect them to and you

446
00:17:57,179 --> 00:17:58,799
know what in the case of - this is a

447
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,299
pretty accurate rendition of New York

448
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:02,309
City as far as the Sega Genesis goes I

449
00:18:02,309 --> 00:18:07,470
found the collie wake up come on get out

450
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:11,760
that stone corn should I host made it

451
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,000
all that didn't I
