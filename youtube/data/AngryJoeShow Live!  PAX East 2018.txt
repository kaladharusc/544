[Music]

51
00:11:55,509 --> 00:11:58,819
celebrate over 30 years so I fight a

52
00:11:58,819 --> 00:12:01,040
game friends basically put this video

53
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,079
together with my buddy lash man will

54
00:12:03,079 --> 00:12:05,359
approach a street fighter the miniatures

55
00:12:05,359 --> 00:12:09,589
game select and so we put this video

56
00:12:09,589 --> 00:12:12,739
together it was so nerve-racking like I

57
00:12:12,739 --> 00:12:15,379
wanted to do the license justice and I

58
00:12:15,379 --> 00:12:17,389
was like how do you fire how do you

59
00:12:17,389 --> 00:12:20,359
create a video in under two minutes and

60
00:12:20,359 --> 00:12:22,819
things to sort of get across what you've

61
00:12:22,819 --> 00:12:25,189
been working on for two years and it was

62
00:12:25,189 --> 00:12:27,319
so nerve-racking I didn't do the video

63
00:12:27,319 --> 00:12:30,769
for the longest time and then we started

64
00:12:30,769 --> 00:12:31,999
working on it probably about a month

65
00:12:31,999 --> 00:12:34,759
before the Kickstarter and and it just

66
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:37,699
came together you know amazingly and I

67
00:12:37,699 --> 00:12:39,919
was able to convey in the video real

68
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:42,439
quickly what the game is and I think it

69
00:12:42,439 --> 00:12:44,359
turned out really well but the foot

70
00:12:44,359 --> 00:12:46,639
doesn't stop there the plos votes ads

71
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,419
this franchise is iconic film as three

72
00:12:50,419 --> 00:12:52,429
players team up to take off one

73
00:12:52,429 --> 00:13:01,850
overpowered ball this exclusive

74
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:04,129
Kickstarter's add-ons and unlockable

75
00:13:04,129 --> 00:13:06,199
three stretch goals help us celebrate

76
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:09,829
this so we we basically I announced this

77
00:13:09,829 --> 00:13:12,919
at PAX probably I think about two years

78
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:17,480
ago and it's just amazing to see it get

79
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:21,139
funded by you guys and finally it's here

80
00:13:21,139 --> 00:13:23,539

commentary on some angry reviews and and

94
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,660

[Music]

131
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,920
it is no longer the angry Joe show how I

132
00:15:50,920 --> 00:16:02,740
feel much better content than ever

133
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:11,459
before we're gonna do makeup tutorials

134
00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:14,589
you have no room be talking from here on

135
00:16:14,589 --> 00:16:22,990
out what you do this is a real product

136
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:27,329
guys and I'm not joking it is unicorn

137
00:16:27,329 --> 00:16:31,720
pieces and it moisturizes your face and

138
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,350
it actually works

139
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:37,110
it's creepy are you just gonna rub it in

140
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:44,139
in and enhance your skin so I just found

141
00:16:44,139 --> 00:16:48,339
it ironic that you know you know but I

142
00:16:48,339 --> 00:16:52,389
got it no no yes let's so but I will

143
00:16:52,389 --> 00:16:54,970
admit like that that was a lot of fun uh

144
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:57,339
you know I'm man enough to admit I we

145
00:16:57,339 --> 00:17:00,579
went to Sephora for Sephora we didn't

146
00:17:00,579 --> 00:17:03,100
realize how expensive and the ladies

147
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,980
there were so excited they were like

148
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:08,740

00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,059
mean this may go they Scott's so excited

151
00:17:13,059 --> 00:17:14,789
there were customers in the store like

152
00:17:14,789 --> 00:17:17,470
you know waiting around while like three

153
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,390
ladies are hovering around me doing my

154
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:21,970
makeup they were jealous what they did

155
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:24,939
the makeup absolutely professional and

156
00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:26,949
I'm so sorry we don't have the picture

157
00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:29,860
here for you but obviously I had to take

158
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,900
it all up and then do my own and I

159
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,820
obviously don't know what I'm doing

160
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,160
so it looks pretty bad so yeah I just

161
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,660
wanted to share that that little story

162
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:42,970
with you and yeah cool so let's just go

163
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:47,050
ahead and talk a little bit about just

164
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:49,810
because I'm doing the board game and I'm

165
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:52,000
doing movie reviews doesn't mean that

166
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,620
we're you know stopped in the angry Joe

167
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:55,720
show all this allows us to continue to

168
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,490
bring you more and stuff so don't worry

169
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:59,800
just because of the board game I've

170
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,600
actually been working on that for the

171
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,300
past two years so I've had to juggle a

172
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:08,080
lot and it's almost like through four

173
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,880
full-time jobs you got you know you to

174
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,090
which can take up your whole day and and

175
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:14,410
it's a full-time job then we do the

176
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:16,480
twitch stream and del riff here helps us

177
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,240
out alive that is recently been doing a

178
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,820
lot more the rapid-fire reviews or

179
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:24,190
really good del and that provides the

180
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:27,280
content in-between our other reviews and

181
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,560
then I've got the board game company and

182
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,510
now this Kickstarter which is basically

183
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:34,270
like a full-time job so it's a lot to

184
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,980
manage but I did want to let you guys

185
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,660
know that reviews aren't going anywhere

186
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,910
and if you give me like a month or two

187
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,350
they're gonna start coming down they're

188
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:42,610
a lot of fun to make we have a great

189
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:45,880
time exactly when we flip on that camera

190
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,520
just that's where the magic happens Joe

191
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,710
nothing but improv yes so we just want

192
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:52,720
to let you in on the creative process

193
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,420
and kind of how we put these things

194
00:18:55,420 --> 00:19:00,910
together how do we do it Joe they wing

195
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:03,310
it exactly same way they wing it resin

196
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,680
tation yeah get the costumes put it on

197
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,960
and turn on the camera yeah it's it we

198
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,940
play the games and and we'll have a

199
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:13,210
notepad we'll sit next to here let me go

200
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:15,220
ahead and play some of this while I talk

201
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:18,160
so you know we'll play the games we'll

202
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,140
sit with a notepad will write down funny

203
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:23,410
ideas and parodies and things and then

204
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:26,220
when we start filming these things

205
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:29,230
people will stare at us or or you know

206
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:31,060
things like that and I don't know we get

207
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:33,580
inspired to do new jokes and so we'll

208
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:37,090
run in the house and chains

209
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:39,799
my goodness I'm not gonna talking I

210
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:41,520
gotta watch this

211
00:19:41,520 --> 00:20:12,500
[Music]

212
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,080

you ugly zombie game okay player stupid

216
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:47,010
zombie games this year just torturing me

217
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:51,540
come on let's go

218
00:20:51,540 --> 00:21:01,830
[Music]

219
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:04,090
[Music]

220
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:18,080
that's that's not part of it do a lot of

221
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,299
profanity but that's the show you guys

222
00:21:20,299 --> 00:21:24,109
know that so I lost my train of thought

223
00:21:24,109 --> 00:21:26,570
by watching that but I just say it was

224
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:28,220
so entertaining watching your faces

225
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,409
watch one of my videos I've never seen

226
00:21:30,409 --> 00:21:32,210
that before like so many of you that was

227
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:32,599
crazy

228
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:36,409
I loved it so yeah as you can tell you

229
00:21:36,409 --> 00:21:38,179
would think that by now in our tenth

230
00:21:38,179 --> 00:21:41,059
year we would have big full-blown

231
00:21:41,059 --> 00:21:43,190
productions I would have a big staff of

232
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:45,649
writers and things and and people to

233
00:21:45,649 --> 00:21:47,809
edit the videos but no it's just me and

234
00:21:47,809 --> 00:21:50,479
Joe and del riff who are doing all the

235
00:21:50,479 --> 00:21:53,210
work and I think that's kind of what the

236
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:55,249
essence is of the angry Joe show we get

237
00:21:55,249 --> 00:21:58,340
to be cheesy because our videos are dumb

238
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:00,259
they're cheesy and they're dumb but

239
00:22:00,259 --> 00:22:03,349
they're fun and they're raw and they you

240
00:22:03,349 --> 00:22:06,739
know just kind of try to convey the

241
00:22:06,739 --> 00:22:08,659
emotions and feelings that we all have

242
00:22:08,659 --> 00:22:11,539
when we play these games so I hope that

243
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:14,059
that comes through in in this video so

244
00:22:14,059 --> 00:22:15,349
I'm just gonna play one more cuz I

245
00:22:15,349 --> 00:22:16,759
really want to watch I'll watch this

246
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:19,309
look and then we'll go to the Q&amp;A all

247
00:22:19,309 --> 00:22:21,409
right our wishes that they had CGI as

248
00:22:21,409 --> 00:22:23,179
good as we do yeah well thank you like

249
00:22:23,179 --> 00:22:26,359
they can't even come close a good DBZ

250
00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:28,700
game like a piece of crap the music

251
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:32,119
connector we reviewed laughs now Joe I

252
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:37,639
can show you my real power

253
00:22:37,639 --> 00:22:50,779
you think you do power fighting so good

254
00:22:50,779 --> 00:22:54,269
that just means I don't have to hold

255
00:22:54,269 --> 00:22:58,140

email mucho powerful versions of blue is

262

that all I've been training the way

263
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,410
harder than you could ever imagine

264
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:38,750
I've achieved the level no one's ever

265
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,780
seen before

266
00:23:39,780 --> 00:24:09,940
[Music]

267
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:22,710
I have a story without

268
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:34,870
[Music]

269
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:36,640
[Applause]

270
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:41,120
[Music]

271
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:50,550
so you hit that window I I can't thank

272
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:52,590
you guys enough for for allowing us to

273
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:56,310
just mistakes and just act silly so Joey

274
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:59,550
show with that wig we were well I was in

275
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:02,190
the costume room changing and we just so

276
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:03,960
happen to have that right that wasn't

277
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,000
the plan like that modern is not the

278
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,220
thing and I say hey I got a great idea

279
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:11,310
let's just try this out let's reuse our

280
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:13,260
costumes but make some use out of them

281
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:17,070
and I think it turned out pretty well so

282
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:19,980
yeah Jojo as you could tell Joe works

283
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,960
out and I don't so that's how he was

284
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:25,200
able to achieve that that level but all

285
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,470
the these things are you know nostalgic

286
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:31,500
for me and it's just so cool to be able

287
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:35,100
to you know add something to Dragon Ball

288
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,230
Z and then you know with the Street

289
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:40,500
Fighter game and and I just want to give

290
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,420
you a little sneak peek at what's coming

291
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:45,060
up for other licenses that you guys have

292
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:48,510
made possible so I'm gonna show you two

293
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:50,370
that I kind of snuck in a video and then

294
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:53,970
one brand new miniature for an upcoming

295
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:55,950
game that nobody's ever seen

296
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:59,790
finished so here is I think you

297
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:03,090
recognize this gentleman here and Sub

298
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:05,760
Zero for our upcoming Mortal Kombat

299
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,130
miniatures game and I just wanted to

300
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:10,500
show you you know the painstaking detail

301
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,780
we have put into these things this is

302
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:15,690
done by Dargan jargon they're miniature

303
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:18,840
sculptors and now obviously this is a

304
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,570
colored 3d render so the actual final

305
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:23,700
miniature isn't gonna look quite as good

306
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,860
as this this is what they do in the

307
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,300
industry but what we're gonna do is

308
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:30,240
we're gonna try to hit this as close as

309
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,650
possible and a lot of these things are

310
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:34,710
really impressive in person so whereas

311
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:36,660
I'm not sure if I can say the name of

312
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:40,890
another product Blair Oh flicks you know

313
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:43,410
something like that will have something

314
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:45,300
between like four to ten painting

315
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:48,540
operations our miniatures have 60 to 80

316
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,450
painting operations and when I went to

317
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:51,900
these men

318
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,270
factures they were they were like I'm

319
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:57,660
sorry what you you want what and they're

320
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,340
like do you not want to make any money

321
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,500
do you realize how expensive this game

322
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,470
is to produce and I said I don't care I

323
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:07,560
want the best for this and so we're

324
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:10,380
really not I mean I've seen some money

325
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:12,510
let's make that the King star as nothing

326
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:14,820
I'm telling you guys that's not true our

327
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,710
margins are completely gone and the

328
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:19,800
reason why we can do that is because of

329
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,770
you because like I'm not a company on

330
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:24,630
Kickstarter that lives off Kickstarter I

331
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:26,370
have the YouTube because of you people

332
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:28,770
so what I can do is even if we break

333
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:31,050
even I'm fine you know because you guys

334
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:33,090
have supported us over these past 10

335
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:34,950
years so we're trying to to pour

336
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:37,110
everything we have into it so that was

337
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:39,060
this is another gentleman you might

338
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:41,850
recognize and score pin and then I'll go

339
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:43,920
ahead and show you you know and then so

340
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,510
the so the development process there's a

341
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:47,460
lot of little cool interesting decisions

342
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:50,280

don't know if you guys like her but I

346

think she's freaking sweet so that's

347
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,300
what she looks like and I can't wait to

348
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,580

350
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:09,060

353
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:18,120
on Twitch oh yeah hi I'm Dell uh nobody

354
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,160

355
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,200
still so let me just do might this has

356
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,340
been for years

357
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:25,500
so I'll just say hi I've been here four

358
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,930
years and you guys still come in and go

359
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:31,710
I don't know who you are but hi hi

360
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,850
everybody

361
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:38,020
so uh I've just recently started doing

362
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:40,780
the rapid fires on the channel and I'm

363
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:44,290
still new so please be gentle you guys

364
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:45,700
have been really supportive of that and

365
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,370
I've been really appreciative of the the

366
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:52,090
90% of the good comments the other 10%

367
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:55,650
they make me stay up at night sad but uh

368
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:58,060
but no I've been it's been a really

369
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:01,810
crazy experience for me because you know

370
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:03,880
I got I got really lucky meeting this

371
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,920
guy and I never thought that I'd be

372
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,110
doing what I do today I thought maybe

373
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:10,390
I'd like live and die in a Best Buy or

374
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:14,020
something later and on in life but like

375
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:16,450
it's just been a great experience and I

376
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:18,190
think one of the scariest things was

377
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:19,480
getting into the show because he's been

378
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,310
doing this for what like eight ten years

379
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:21,970
at this point

380
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:23,860
and when I first started doing the rapid

381
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:26,110
fires everybody was like having this

382
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:28,060
expectation of they have to be on the

383
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:30,460
same level as his but you guys have been

384
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:32,740
really supportive and really helpful and

385
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:34,720
giving me critique and hey you could do

386
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,290
this better

387
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:37,270
you know don't suck as much and I'm like

388
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:39,970
oh thanks that's that's wonderful so

389
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:41,680
it's been helpful and you know it's been

390
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,270
transformative and I've been working on

391
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:44,830
it but the next thing I will say that I

392
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:46,300
am reviewing is a game called extinction

393
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:49,330
which involves giant orc dudes and so

394
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:50,470
that's gonna be the next thing I'm

395
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:51,670
working on I don't know about them

396
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:53,710
personally but you know I appreciate you

397
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:56,620
guys and you know maybe maybe here's

398
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:57,790
everyone

399
00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:00,190
no duh I appreciate it's not that people

400
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:01,750
don't know you are it's just that you're

401
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:04,000
not always on camera and so when I'm

402
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,860
acting silly and stuff like that manage

403
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:07,330
on camera and they don't see Dell very

404
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:09,100
often let me let me kind of let clue you

405
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,380
in on what's going on behind the scenes

406
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:13,120
and how much Dell contributes when we

407
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,890
play these games and we formulate our

408
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:18,010
opinions you know sometimes I'm not very

409
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:19,180
good at you know say especially

410
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:21,580
first-person shooters and Dell it can

411
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,710
come in and give me that angle and tell

412
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:25,840
me exactly what's broken I remember one

413
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,120
of the one of those best examples is the

414
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,730
Division I I mean it's kind of obvious

415
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:32,710
some things were broken in that game I

416
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:35,650
knew but to get actual footage that is

417
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:38,110
so important to me in my show because

418
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:40,720
what I like to do is I like to inform at

419
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,210
the same time I'm entertaining so you

420
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:45,690
have to show the person what the

421
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:48,149
actual bug or the the stupid part in the

422
00:30:48,149 --> 00:30:50,129
game that needs fixing and Dell can

423
00:30:50,129 --> 00:30:52,289
provide these kinds of things that might

424
00:30:52,289 --> 00:30:55,440
take me like 10 20 hours of re-recording

425
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,029
over and over it takes somebody with

426
00:30:57,029 --> 00:30:59,789
Dell skill a lot shorter so and then

427
00:30:59,789 --> 00:31:01,649
just writing the reviews and stuff he'll

428
00:31:01,649 --> 00:31:04,049
send me notes and things of his

429
00:31:04,049 --> 00:31:06,179
experiences and I really that's what

430
00:31:06,179 --> 00:31:07,679
happened then I go in I test and I go oh

431
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:09,360
my god I didn't even get to that aspect

432
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,340
so when you're doing these reviews that

433
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:15,570
turn that have bloated overtime to 30 40

434
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:18,600
minutes and that's just because I always

435
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,639
look at the comments and no George Joe

436
00:31:20,639 --> 00:31:23,850
you didn't do the the third raid and

437
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:25,110
destiny - so you don't know what the

438
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:28,830
fuck you're talking about you can't say

439
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:30,450
anything about the game unless you've

440
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:34,200
played it 220 hours and and I'm you know

441
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,049
so that how all this stuff that Dell

442
00:31:37,049 --> 00:31:39,750
does and that Joe does all goes into

443
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:43,490
making the Angry reviews great expansive

444
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:45,659
wide-ranging and and it takes a long

445
00:31:45,659 --> 00:31:47,700
time to produce those kinds of things so

446
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:50,460
we really value and appreciate that

447
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:54,659
so okay I have some goodies to give to

448
00:31:54,659 --> 00:31:56,460
y'all because y'all came on such

449
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:59,309
last-minute notice I wanted to give

450
00:31:59,309 --> 00:32:02,250
everybody well I don't think everybody

451
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:04,409

so here's what we'll do we'll do Q&amp;A and

455
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:14,330

463

pressure

464
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:40,850
ask other Joel a lot of questions hold

465
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:43,970

466

the big surprise yeah so we have a

467
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:51,980
community over here going on the

468
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,600
Kickstarter and you know where people

469
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,610
are back and from so far London is

470
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:58,070
kicking ass thank you very much London

471
00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:00,260
followed by Los Angeles Sydney and you

472
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,640
can kind of see where people back from

473
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,770
and we've got this great community in

474
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:06,290
our comments and and so if you decide to

475
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:09,200
back the game or or pledge any you can

476
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,880
come in here but anyway the point is

477
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,310
these guys wanted me to let you know of

478
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:16,400
a little bet they have running is that

479
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,970
if we get a certain amount usually these

480
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:21,890
things will double or triple towards the

481
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:24,410
end Kickstarter's they spike then they

482
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:25,940
have a lull and then they spike at the

483
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:28,250
end but they just wanted to do this bet

484
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:31,340
that I agreed to that if we manage to

485
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:34,790
hit 2 million I will be dressing up and

486
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:39,110
cosplaying as hammy yeah so uh stake to

487
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:40,850
do of that know you're really gonna

488
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:43,610
enjoy that yet so I wanted to confirm

489
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:45,200
that go ahead with your question

490
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,890
all right any chance of you doing a

491
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:50,330
review of Justice League with Doug

492
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:53,720
Walker Justice League I actually don't

493
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:56,390
know Doug you know the channel awesome

494
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:59,120
guys they they pull my pull my videos

495
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,680
and put the videos up on the website

496
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,480
we've done many crossovers with them in

497
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,400
the past I've loved the Man of Steel

498
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,140
thing I was so honored cuz I got to

499
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:08,389
dress up as Superman and you don't do

500
00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:10,159
that enough yeah he does such a good job

501
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:13,159
so I would love to yeah if he asks me to

502
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:14,780
then I'm doing it but you know I just

503
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:17,480
kind of just I'm in my own little world

504
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,310
just trying to make videos for you guys

505
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:20,840
so I don't really get to interact a lot

506
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,760
with with the other people but if you

507
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,440
ask me I'll definitely do it cuz I got a

508
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:27,889
lot to say about Superman's mustache

509
00:34:27,889 --> 00:34:36,230
they ruin you know such a handsome man

510
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:38,419
it's hard to mess up Henry Cavill space

511
00:34:38,419 --> 00:34:40,399
I don't know why they did that anyway

512
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:44,360
thank you here the number of times we've

513
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,710
come over to work and he's in his

514
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:47,750
Superman onesie and won't take it off is

515
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:50,629
just it's been alive yeah so the

516
00:34:50,629 --> 00:34:53,030
gentleman over there yes real quick

517
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,980
before I ask my question I want to say

518
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:56,720
last year I was deployed the Middle East

519
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,880
and on the few days I had off re-washed

520
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,740
almost all your videos and I think the

521
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,900
humor really got me through being away

522
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,100
from my friends and family so thank you

523
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,210
so much for keeping those videos out

524
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:12,620
there thank you for your service and

525
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:15,080
thank you so much for saying that thank

526
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,030
you so my quick question is a lot of

527
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:19,070
your videos involves something about DLC

528
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:21,770
downloadable content what ways do you

529
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:24,650
think that companies can implement DLC

530
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:26,210
in the right way or a little bit more

531
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:29,270
ethical way yeah so thank you for asking

532
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:31,970
that because obviously as we we get

533
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:34,040
further into this world of micro

534
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,290
transactions in DLC we should probably

535
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:38,210
band together and kind of come up with a

536
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:40,450
list of Commandments I know a few of my

537
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:42,680
viewers have have kind of done something

538
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,120
but maybe I could put out some video

539
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,550
that that kind of gives all my stances

540
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:49,100
on what I feel is like exploitative and

541
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:52,670
and what is acceptable because some of

542
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:54,110
these companies gonna do it anyway and

543
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,900
we can encourage and support the ones

544
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,640
that do it the right way and and sort of

545
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,440
discourage the ones that don't so I

546
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:04,000
don't mind DLC I just like for example

547
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,620
battlefront - yeah are these games were

548
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:08,480
that require you to spend 60 bucks up

549
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,240
front and then use the very same payment

550
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,130
model and grinding model and

551
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:14,960
microtransactions that are in mobile

552
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,780
games - just to squeeze more out of you

553
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:20,210
that's where I'm like no no but if it

554
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:22,700
was zero dollars up front where you know

555
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,380
a lot of mobile games are zero dollars

556
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:26,240
that I have no problem with that and

557
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,520
there are some mobile game

558
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,820
that I'll play and that I enjoy with

559
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,360
microtransactions a joke you're a

560
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,340
hypocrite how could you play that mobile

561
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:35,320
game well I'm first off I'm not really

562
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,790
serious about I play when I'm sitting on

563
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:38,920
the toilet it's not it's not a real game

564
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,870
to me and I mean I guess it's a real

565
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:42,070
game but you know what I mean it's just

566
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:45,640
farting around with it literally you

567
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:48,760
know but I spent $0 and I'm like there

568
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,040
are a few that I'll kick you 5 10 bucks

569
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,050
no problem but when you're asking people

570
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:55,360
60 bucks up front and there's locked

571
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,550
content on the disc and and you can

572
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:58,810
clearly tell they're ripping things out

573
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:01,000
and selling it piecemeal that's not cool

574
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:11,740
with me but yeah thank you thank you yes

575
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:13,660
sir hi it's really great to see you a

576
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:16,150
longtime fan one thing I always wondered

577
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,500
is there any game that you wish you

578
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,360
could change the score of see how it's

579
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:24,340
like develop oh yeah okay so I get a

580
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:29,490
game I remember a long long time ago I

581
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:32,050
raided a game when I first started

582
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:34,390
reviewing it was so exciting because I

583
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:36,640
started getting review copies and that's

584
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,200
intoxicating you know when when

585
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,180
companies are like hey we were gonna

586
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:41,530
send you this copy I get this copy in

587
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:45,730
the mail it's like I was like and I'm so

588
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,560
excited and I'll play a game I think it

589
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:50,350
was sacred was the first one and and

590
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:52,540
they had heavy metal like they for no

591
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:53,980
reason like some of the characters in

592
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,570
the game were just jamming out a heavy

593
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:58,000
metal in like the trailer and things

594
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,400
like that but overall the game wasn't

595
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,470
quite as good as I think I said I think

596
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:05,380
I was like a an eight or a seven and at

597
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:08,470
the time spoonie had come straight up so

598
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:09,460
you like things like the first time I

599
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:11,350
ever met him and he comes here he's like

600
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:14,470
Joe I watched your review on sacred I

601
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:17,860
was like oh yeah yeah it was cool he's

602
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:18,760
like yeah I bought it on your

603
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,710
recommendation and I was like wait he's

604
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:26,860
like it was terrible and then I kind of

605
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:28,510
dwelled on and I thought about it and I

606
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:30,250
was like you know I guess it kind of

607
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:32,140
wasn't as good as I thought and I went

608
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:33,550
back and I was like so yeah there are

609
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:36,400
from time to time there are a few scores

610
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,020
that I kind of regret given I'll get

611
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:40,840
caught up in just the

612
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:43,120
the meta stuff like one of them Suicide

613
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:46,300
Squad I always get crap for Suicide

614
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,010
Squad because I gave it an 8 out of 10

615
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:53,440
but we had and we had a meet in Austin

616
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,510
were angry army fans came out so I

617
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:57,370
watched that with you guys and we were

618
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:59,290
drinking cuz they at the Alamo

619
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:01,720
Drafthouse you can have beers and so I

620
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,820
just thought it was dumb like silly fun

621
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:05,800
and I didn't realize the giving in an 8

622
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,320
would forever follow me for the rest of

623
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:12,960
my life is Suicide Squad but yeah I

624
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,660
think a lot of the thing too is like

625
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:18,190
will just get so wrapped up in playing

626
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:20,200
the game that we never really get a

627
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,180
chance to sit on it after we're done

628
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,860
playing it because Joe goes right into

629
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,840
this world this world is like I need

630
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,280
that video where's that video why it

631
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,980
just came out yesterday and now honestly

632
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:30,610
it was cool

633
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:33,040
I started getting review copies and and

634
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,230
then my show and they started seeing

635
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:37,000
what I would do and then I'm I don't

636
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,660
play ball and so now I don't you copies

637
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:42,670
very often anymore it's pretty

638
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:45,010
surprising who will give me them I'll be

639
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:47,800
upfront and honest Ubisoft is one that

640
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,690
continues to give me a review copies

641
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:51,100
they don't care there are actually some

642
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,740
really cool people over there and and

643
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:55,660
there's some fans of the angry gesture I

644
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:58,570
think more some some CEOs sons and

645
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:00,310
daughters like the show so I think

646
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:01,780
that's why they keep sending us copies

647
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:04,420
even though they know Joe's not nice to

648
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:06,550
some of those but but thank you to them

649
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:09,460
cuz they're very cool yeah oh you guys

650
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:12,910
can ask these guys questions okay go

651
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,470
ahead what's going on Joe thanks for

652
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:15,880
showing up here hey hey I want to say

653
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,560
thank you for the titanfall to anger

654
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,300
review because that was spot-on and

655
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:22,900
beautiful and complete justice is there

656
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,520
a game coming up in the near future that

657
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,440
you're it doesn't matter if you're doing

658
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,090
an anger review for but has the same

659
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:29,830
type of effect where the developers are

660
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:31,420
doing it right and this game looks very

661
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:33,870
promising that you would recommend okay

662
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:38,440
so well that requires me to have kind of

663
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,570
hands-on or at least behind the scenes

664
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:41,980
kind of looking at it so I can give you

665
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:45,430
some early looks at it that I think it's

666
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:47,530
coming along well if you were just

667
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:48,610
talking about what games I'm personally

668
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:50,260
excited about it like obviously Red Dead

669
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:52,540
Redemption - I did like three videos

670
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:53,260
separately

671
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:55,210
that for the first one so I'm looking

672
00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:57,400
forward to that as far as developers who

673
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,320
doing it right I'm talking fast because

674
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,400
I want to get as many of you guys in

675
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:05,200
here as possible is a cyberpunk from the

676
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,910
developers of which your CD Projekt RED

677
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:08,680
they do things right now I don't know

678
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,810
how it's coming Saddam coming to me

679
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:12,670
Oh Jones got back behind the scenes

680
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:15,310
stuff but those guys know what they're

681
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:17,080
doing and they really care about the

682
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,820
license and they care about the people

683
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:21,430
to purchase their games and so I always

684
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:23,650
love supporting CD Projekt RED so

685
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:25,660
definitely buy cyberpunk when it comes

686
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:32,890
out but yeah thank you so I just want to

687
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:35,410
say that uh ignore the YouTube comments

688
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:37,570
and the twitch comments especially like

689
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:39,910
Deluth and whatnot they're just jealous

690
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:42,300
of how beautiful I am

691
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:47,140
you are indeed you're so sexy do they

692
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:48,790
don't have a beautiful if you do down

693
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:50,740
the way I knew Dell and he makes you

694
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:52,810
laugh day-to-day he makes playing games

695
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:55,180
so much more fun when you're kind of

696
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,830
burned out and he's a Jolin you know

697
00:41:56,830 --> 00:41:58,330
let's play it and then you just get so

698
00:41:58,330 --> 00:42:00,190
happy again and plus he's just so

699
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:03,160
huggable and fun to touch it's my best

700
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:06,910
quality we wouldn't be here you know if

701
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:08,140

702
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:10,240

707
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:23,530
time that you guys spend doing streaming

708
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:26,260
and working on new YouTube videos how do

709
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:28,000

713
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:39,070

714
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:40,960
dude so I have no complaints but that's

715
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,460

716
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:44,350
back and and check out like Elder

717
00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:46,510
Scrolls online because you know even

718
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:48,070
though I had problems with the game when

719
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:50,170
we would do these massive raids together

720
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:52,450
and I would give these speeches in the

721
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:54,400
game to like you know like a hundred

722
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,830
players and I would be like do you know

723
00:42:56,830 --> 00:42:59,080
what lies beyond that bridge your

724
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:02,730
immortality take it it's yours charge

725
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:04,060

everybody like the feeling there's so

727

few feelings in the world like that and

728
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:11,320
and so everybody's acting as a group so

729
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:13,330
any game that comes out for you

730
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:14,560
publishers out there then you're

731
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:15,100

732
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:17,020
I want another planet side like a

733
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:19,360
planetside 3 or like another one of

734
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,040
those games were we could get the whole

735
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,900
angry army like everybody in this room

736
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,520

737
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:27,040

738
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,570

739
00:43:28,570 --> 00:43:32,070
cool thank you for that question

740
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:42,190
good throw good review of it but so with

741
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:44,080
Dragon Age 4 coming out what would you

742
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,100
like to see like what would actually

743
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:46,810
make it make a happy review for you oh

744
00:43:46,810 --> 00:43:52,810
is it really I haven't seen it okay I'll

745
00:43:52,810 --> 00:43:54,090
have to check that out um

746
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:56,590
what do I think of it well I hope it's

747
00:43:56,590 --> 00:44:00,100
not you know too generic or anything

748
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:00,700
like that

749
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:02,740
I think after what's happened go ahead

750
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:05,530
yeah I hope it's not - yeah I hope it's

751
00:44:05,530 --> 00:44:08,440
not that one that doesn't exist it's I

752
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,210
want to know what team did it if what

753
00:44:10,210 --> 00:44:12,190
happened to the team that did you know

754
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:15,160
it's it sucks and I know I hope I'm not

755
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,770
the one that contributed to this you

756
00:44:17,770 --> 00:44:19,600
know the Mass Effect Andromeda that's a

757
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:22,240
sad story because I love Mass Effect and

758
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,740
I want to see more and they were like no

759
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:25,990
it's done you know I was like no dude do

760
00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:28,210
better next time don't don't kill it you

761
00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:29,470
know but I guess they just want to

762
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:31,150
restart so I'm wondering if some of the

763
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:33,490
team went over from there to maybe

764
00:44:33,490 --> 00:44:35,770
Dragon Age 4 so as long as they don't

765
00:44:35,770 --> 00:44:38,590
bring the the facial map guy or the face

766
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:40,930
to animate I'm super that and bless his

767
00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:41,290
heart

768
00:44:41,290 --> 00:44:44,170
maybe we can give him a job doing I

769
00:44:44,170 --> 00:44:46,570
don't know maybe the floors and not shit

770
00:44:46,570 --> 00:44:48,250
maybe I'm just kidding you know I love

771
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:49,630
you I don't know who you are but I love

772
00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:51,960
you dude it was his face that was tired

773
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:56,170
yeah his face was tired that day and he

774
00:44:56,170 --> 00:44:57,490
thought somebody was gonna come in and

775
00:44:57,490 --> 00:44:59,140
fix it later and they done did him dirty

776
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:03,310
so yes hey Joe I just wanted to ask you

777
00:45:03,310 --> 00:45:05,080
regarding a tweet that you posted

778
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:08,530
earlier about a specific to a Pacific

779
00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:11,230
Rim uprising oh yeah any further

780
00:45:11,230 --> 00:45:13,030
comments regarding the whole copyright

781
00:45:13,030 --> 00:45:13,400
claim

782
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:15,340
and everything else about you know

783
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:18,470
Universal pictures that they yeah did so

784
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:20,720
you know if you don't know Chris

785
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,390
Stockman who is an amazing movie review

786
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:25,640
or I aspire to do movie reviews as good

787
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,590
as he he's real good

788
00:45:27,590 --> 00:45:29,750
and and Jeremy Jones my boys over there

789
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:32,090
reviewing movies so I just wanted to be

790
00:45:32,090 --> 00:45:35,180
as good as in but anyway so they they

791
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:36,590
constantly deal with you know some

792
00:45:36,590 --> 00:45:38,690
companies and some companies are cool

793
00:45:38,690 --> 00:45:39,950
and some companies aren't the one that's

794
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:42,890
not cool is Universal Zephyr and it may

795
00:45:42,890 --> 00:45:44,900
be this Zephyr part of it

796
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:47,180
and universals fault too because they

797
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:49,460
need to put get the rains on these guys

798
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:52,570
and they just aggressively you know

799
00:45:52,570 --> 00:45:55,610
strong-armed and bully people kind of on

800
00:45:55,610 --> 00:45:57,920
these things in my opinion and and

801
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,930
copyright claim if you just basically

802
00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:02,030
talk about their movie I have some

803
00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:03,440
footage playing in the background but it

804
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,540
is obscured it's not a substitute for

805
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:07,820
the original and it was the in the press

806
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:11,120
release so it's like why would you claim

807
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:13,190
a video of stuff that you would give

808
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:15,860
people to post when you're doing movie

809
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:18,680
reviews so yeah I don't know there's

810
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:20,000
just good and bad companies out there

811
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,070
and it's getting crazy on YouTube man

812
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:24,650
with a lot of videos being demonetised

813
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:27,860
for four reasons that that don't quite

814
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:30,350
make sense I understand trying to

815
00:46:30,350 --> 00:46:32,330
cultivate some good content and get rid

816
00:46:32,330 --> 00:46:34,940
of the bad apples but you're hurting

817
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:36,830
good people too and and good people's

818
00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:38,690
dreams and people come up to John's

819
00:46:38,690 --> 00:46:40,970
making this channel and I love your

820
00:46:40,970 --> 00:46:42,230
videos and I'm trying to do the same

821
00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:43,940
thing and I keep getting the monetize

822
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:45,710
can you help me and I was like I can't

823
00:46:45,710 --> 00:46:47,570
even get my help sometimes you know so I

824
00:46:47,570 --> 00:46:49,730
have to use you know Twitter and tweet

825
00:46:49,730 --> 00:46:52,720
about it and these companies will see so

826
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,620
eventually this is going to come to a

827
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:56,840
head I think in the next five years or

828
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:58,190
something big is gonna happen where

829
00:46:58,190 --> 00:46:59,690
somebody has to take somebody to court

830
00:46:59,690 --> 00:47:02,330
to get a little bit more you know better

831
00:47:02,330 --> 00:47:04,520
rules in place but thank you so much for

832
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:10,580
the question here you go yeah how's it

833
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:15,200
going guys say that I'm a fan of yours I

834
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,790
love post apocalyptic stuff like the

835
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:18,320
last bus and the Fallout series but my

836
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,600
all-time favorite has to be the Metro

837
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,400
series and now with Metro exit is coming

838
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,200
on in the fall what I want each of your

839
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:26,420
opinions on it even though there's still

840
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:30,350
not a lot of to go on look that good can

841
00:47:30,350 --> 00:47:33,830
it is is is that for real because I am

842
00:47:33,830 --> 00:47:36,170
so excited like if this looks amazing

843
00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:39,230
and I hope it's going to kind of do for

844
00:47:39,230 --> 00:47:41,330
Metro well the previous Mitchell's were

845
00:47:41,330 --> 00:47:43,400
great but you know how Zelda for me I'm

846
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,110
there I never played Zelda before and

847
00:47:45,110 --> 00:47:46,640
they when they went with this kind of

848
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:49,880
new open-world thing it got new excited

849
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:52,100
people on to the franchise to experience

850
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:55,190
it and I hope that kind of this jump for

851
00:47:55,190 --> 00:47:57,740
Metro is gonna do the same cuz Metro not

852
00:47:57,740 --> 00:47:59,180
a lot of people know about and people

853
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:00,680
forget about it in fact I think I was

854
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:02,360
you know talking with somebody and

855
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:03,590
listening to games off and then he

856
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:05,810
mentioned Matt oh I forgot you know so I

857
00:48:05,810 --> 00:48:07,520
want this thing to be as big as possible

858
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,230
I know we're gonna do a review on it

859
00:48:09,230 --> 00:48:11,540
we're gonna support it and yeah check

860
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:13,340

862
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:18,200
what Metro is great everybody likes

863
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:20,270
Metro right there's anybody here played

864
00:48:20,270 --> 00:48:22,880
it it's fantastic great game series and

865
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,740
yes we'll be reviewing it looking for

866
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:28,460
those it's gonna be great and honestly

867
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:29,990
of it just seems like a girl during

868
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:32,180
horror games so it's great fantastic I'm

869
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:33,800
gonna dress up when you would go

870
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,270
underground and get those little spider

871
00:48:35,270 --> 00:48:37,580
creatures need to freak out so I hope

872
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:39,230
that's still in there then grows and

873
00:48:39,230 --> 00:48:42,440

874
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:46,520
you so much you love the great work

875
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:50,780
thank you hey Joe I just want to say

876
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:53,180
thank you for your reviews you know a

877
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,160
few of them have been to be honest

878
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:58,550
really um honest and I appreciate the

879
00:48:58,550 --> 00:49:00,560
raw energy that you put behind it yeah

880
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:06,350
with that being said DMC a few times

881
00:49:06,350 --> 00:49:08,210
when I'm upset or something like that

882
00:49:08,210 --> 00:49:10,220
I'll go back to that old video that you

883
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:12,710
did for DMC please tell me what was the

884
00:49:12,710 --> 00:49:14,270
inspiration behind that because it was

885
00:49:14,270 --> 00:49:15,670
spot-on

886
00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:19,130
well just you know the factor that I

887
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:20,150
really love

888
00:49:20,150 --> 00:49:23,240
the franchise and I'd uh it's it sucks

889
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:26,180
because you know I want the franchise to

890
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:27,710
do well because this gives you the

891
00:49:27,710 --> 00:49:29,660
opportunity to do more games and see

892
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:31,579
that return to glory and Dante and

893
00:49:31,579 --> 00:49:33,470
everything but when they take the

894
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:36,470
different direction on it and it went in

895
00:49:36,470 --> 00:49:38,059
that direction and it wasn't something

896
00:49:38,059 --> 00:49:40,099
that I was into I just kind of wanted to

897
00:49:40,099 --> 00:49:43,579
to poke fun at it and and give my

898
00:49:43,579 --> 00:49:46,670
opinion on it and and hopefully there

899
00:49:46,670 --> 00:49:47,930
were people out there with the same

900
00:49:47,930 --> 00:49:49,789
opinion as me and it seemed like there

901
00:49:49,789 --> 00:49:52,369
were and so that got a lot of steam and

902
00:49:52,369 --> 00:49:55,579
momentum and I think Capcom had seen

903
00:49:55,579 --> 00:49:57,619
that and I just hope that that does

904
00:49:57,619 --> 00:49:59,900
translate something to something in the

905
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:01,970
future for the franchise because I hope

906
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:05,150
we do see more but not quite in in that

907
00:50:05,150 --> 00:50:08,900
that take III agree well yeah thank you

908
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:11,500
very much yes

909
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:14,329
and he's always amongst the best

910
00:50:14,329 --> 00:50:16,549
characters in the fighting game so he's

911
00:50:16,549 --> 00:50:18,289
friggin Opie

912
00:50:18,289 --> 00:50:21,770
yes hello gentle sirs first off Joe I

913
00:50:21,770 --> 00:50:23,539
really appreciate your ready player one

914
00:50:23,539 --> 00:50:27,859
review as you can see I love that film

915
00:50:27,859 --> 00:50:30,289
so much and I think it's just a perfect

916
00:50:30,289 --> 00:50:33,020
send up to gamers and I know people give

917
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:35,029
it a lot of shit and they saw Joe you

918
00:50:35,029 --> 00:50:37,130
you you gave it too high rating it's not

919
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:38,119
they're good and it's kind of

920
00:50:38,119 --> 00:50:39,680
fashionable sometimes to hate on these

921
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:42,410
things but I think that you know it was

922
00:50:42,410 --> 00:50:45,859
just you know celebrated it in the

923
00:50:45,859 --> 00:50:47,750
nicest way possible without sort of

924
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:50,150
talking down to as gamers you know right

925
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:52,970
but my question is this I recently just

926
00:50:52,970 --> 00:50:55,039
picked up a game at a flea market for

927
00:50:55,039 --> 00:50:58,010
about a quarter I usually am a

928
00:50:58,010 --> 00:51:00,020
completionist so I try to get every

929
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:02,839
platinum for it the requirement is I

930
00:51:02,839 --> 00:51:05,450
gotta play it twice do you have any

931
00:51:05,450 --> 00:51:07,220
survival tips for ride to hell

932
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:13,910
retribution 25 cent says way too much

933
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:17,779
why did you waste that 25 cents

934
00:51:17,779 --> 00:51:20,700
you're gonna call your mom oh no that's

935
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:22,799
35 cents to something I know payphones

936
00:51:22,799 --> 00:51:25,799
don't even exist anymore all I am yeah

937
00:51:25,799 --> 00:51:28,829
no but you paid way too much yeah

938
00:51:28,829 --> 00:51:30,390
don't play it again I can't believe that

939
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:31,739
achievement where you have to play

940
00:51:31,739 --> 00:51:36,599
multiple so you know what sucks is we

941
00:51:36,599 --> 00:51:39,299
make fun of it and all but secretly when

942
00:51:39,299 --> 00:51:41,609
I go to sleep I'm like god dang I wish

943
00:51:41,609 --> 00:51:45,089
they would make a sequel because that

944
00:51:45,089 --> 00:51:48,390
would make such a good video you know

945
00:51:48,390 --> 00:51:50,819
what I mean it's like but it's like red

946
00:51:50,819 --> 00:51:52,349
letter media have you guys seen their

947
00:51:52,349 --> 00:51:54,299
videos they are so awesome you should

948
00:51:54,299 --> 00:51:56,279
check them out but they love watching

949
00:51:56,279 --> 00:52:00,989
bad movies and I to a certain man I like

950
00:52:00,989 --> 00:52:02,459
playing bad games and there's these

951
00:52:02,459 --> 00:52:05,969
formulas where it's it's really bad and

952
00:52:05,969 --> 00:52:08,880
but and then really incompetent and then

953
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:11,309
really like how could you mess this up

954
00:52:11,309 --> 00:52:13,890
so bad have a 12 year old with you know

955
00:52:13,890 --> 00:52:15,900
a horny 12 year old right the plot of

956
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:19,349
the entire game scribbled on notes at

957
00:52:19,349 --> 00:52:21,599
lunch it seems like and that is kind of

958
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:23,849
an interesting train wreck to watch so I

959
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:25,709
wish they would make another one but

960
00:52:25,709 --> 00:52:33,749
yeah go ahead oh you guys have done a

961
00:52:33,749 --> 00:52:36,329
lot of good skits over the years which

962
00:52:36,329 --> 00:52:38,309

house for some reason and OJ answered

976
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:12,180
the door in the quiet outfit and I just

977
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:15,449
wanted to turn around and just leave but

978
00:53:15,449 --> 00:53:16,589
no that was great

979
00:53:16,589 --> 00:53:19,920
I thought that was a lot mine was

980
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:26,069
actually Yakuza Oh very oaky dressing up

981
00:53:26,069 --> 00:53:27,089
is missing

982
00:53:27,089 --> 00:53:32,579
mr. libido that was pretty fun the

983
00:53:32,579 --> 00:53:54,119
dancing was amazing now let's all stare

984
00:53:54,119 --> 00:53:55,559
at this for the next 10 minutes

985
00:53:55,559 --> 00:54:01,769
oh how happy I was I'm like I gotta do

986
00:54:01,769 --> 00:54:06,299
what man I can't tell you what mine is

987
00:54:06,299 --> 00:54:08,880
because there's so many I love them all

988
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,430
I felt like a badass doing doom

989
00:54:11,430 --> 00:54:16,289
III had such good relief and rage stress

990
00:54:16,289 --> 00:54:17,930
relief from no man sky

991
00:54:17,930 --> 00:54:19,890
Ghostbusters really focus I love

992
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:21,989
Ghostbusters and I've always wanted to

993
00:54:21,989 --> 00:54:24,210
dress up and put myself in the movie and

994
00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:25,559
I finally got to put myself and

995
00:54:25,559 --> 00:54:27,450
Ghostbusters and and try to do it

996
00:54:27,450 --> 00:54:30,299
justice for the fans of the Ghostbusters

997
00:54:30,299 --> 00:54:33,239
and not recent stuff but probably I

998
00:54:33,239 --> 00:54:35,489
think amongst my favorite is The Witcher

999
00:54:35,489 --> 00:54:38,249
3 because of just the silliness and the

1000
00:54:38,249 --> 00:54:40,739
baby dancing and and us dancing to the

1001
00:54:40,739 --> 00:54:42,450
to the excellent music so that's mine

1002
00:54:42,450 --> 00:54:52,979
witcher 3 hello so as an incredibly

1003
00:54:52,979 --> 00:54:55,410
business excuse me an incredibly busy

1004
00:54:55,410 --> 00:54:57,719
businessman if a meeting doesn't go your

1005
00:54:57,719 --> 00:54:59,160
way with the suits or something doesn't

1006
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:00,660
quite pan out what do you do to

1007
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:05,249
decompress who I don't I don't have time

1008
00:55:05,249 --> 00:55:06,930
to decompress but that's actually a

1009
00:55:06,930 --> 00:55:10,140
secret for workaholics is you're

1010
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,819
decompression is working on that next

1011
00:55:11,819 --> 00:55:13,170
project you know what I mean you could

1012
00:55:13,170 --> 00:55:14,940
go directly oh it's it's it's not

1013
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:16,440
working out that licensing they they

1014
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:18,390
have to do this and approving it takes

1015
00:55:18,390 --> 00:55:20,430
them three months to do something so

1016
00:55:20,430 --> 00:55:22,170
simple so then then you go and you work

1017
00:55:22,170 --> 00:55:24,180
on something else or you go and do the

1018
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:26,279
next angry review or you go do a stream

1019
00:55:26,279 --> 00:55:28,229
and and so because I have these four

1020
00:55:28,229 --> 00:55:30,119
things juggling or producing and

1021
00:55:30,119 --> 00:55:32,190
directing some art and say oh I want the

1022
00:55:32,190 --> 00:55:33,930
scope like this and and it just gets

1023
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:35,489
your mind off of you know some other

1024
00:55:35,489 --> 00:55:36,809
things that may not be going your way

1025
00:55:36,809 --> 00:55:39,299
and then you find that when you come

1026
00:55:39,299 --> 00:55:40,680
back to it your

1027
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:42,300
refreshed and you look at it from a

1028
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:44,160
different angle and yourself and you and

1029
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,109
you can come up with some good ideas so

1030
00:55:46,109 --> 00:55:48,530
yeah thank you that's a great question

1031
00:55:48,530 --> 00:55:53,910

1035
00:56:06,270 --> 00:56:09,540
hate myself for it I've lost so many

1036
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:12,119

1041
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:31,950
to think man um I do actually play

1042
00:56:31,950 --> 00:56:34,800
sports game and I'm ashamed to admit I

1043
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:38,460
do play Madden because I'm oh god dang

1044
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:40,830
it I don't I'm so mad at you that money

1045
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:43,290
comes down the angry Joe show need to

1046
00:56:43,290 --> 00:56:52,170
purchase man and it's because they have

1047
00:56:52,170 --> 00:56:54,990
the freakin NFL license and all of my

1048
00:56:54,990 --> 00:56:57,300
friends buy it every year even though I

1049
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:59,910
begged them not to and they convinced me

1050
00:56:59,910 --> 00:57:01,470
at one point to start doing live streams

1051
00:57:01,470 --> 00:57:03,270
where we stream as a team we'd like to

1052
00:57:03,270 --> 00:57:06,000
do that again but honestly they would

1053
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,830
have some competition and cuz

1054
00:57:07,830 --> 00:57:10,470
competition is great for video games and

1055
00:57:10,470 --> 00:57:12,270
it forces these developer teams to

1056
00:57:12,270 --> 00:57:14,310
basically fight each other and one-up

1057
00:57:14,310 --> 00:57:16,740
each other and that kind of creative get

1058
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:18,860
your creative juices going and just

1059
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:37,260
bleep EA and beat the Oscars shoot video

1060
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:40,050
game you could say something you know

1061
00:57:40,050 --> 00:57:45,510
funny or inappropriate but I think no I

1062
00:57:45,510 --> 00:57:47,580
think it's probably the little crappy

1063
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:50,580
mobile games from time to time for a

1064
00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:53,930
while there I played a lot of Star Wars

1065
00:57:53,930 --> 00:57:56,310
was it called like a galaxy of Heroes

1066
00:57:56,310 --> 00:57:58,470
but I didn't I didn't drop much money

1067
00:57:58,470 --> 00:58:01,410
and I think I was like 10 15 20 $30 it

1068
00:58:01,410 --> 00:58:04,170
keeps your knob throwing up but you know

1069
00:58:04,170 --> 00:58:06,240
it was zero up front and I had some fun

1070
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:08,310
with it but then I got bored of it and I

1071
00:58:08,310 --> 00:58:13,160
moved on so those those kinds of games

1072
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:15,390
it's a great question and I'll have a

1073
00:58:15,390 --> 00:58:17,160
better answer for you than the next time

1074
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:20,070
go ahead just gonna say you guys make

1075
00:58:20,070 --> 00:58:22,050
like the best reviews out there thank

1076
00:58:22,050 --> 00:58:23,010
you thank you

1077
00:58:23,010 --> 00:58:25,560
but the question is what's each of your

1078
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:30,630
favorite games to play right now I'm

1079
00:58:30,630 --> 00:58:32,670
always first has got a buffer it you got

1080
00:58:32,670 --> 00:58:36,390
a same day oh are the fastest on the

1081
00:58:36,390 --> 00:58:39,090
draw and you're you know this I just

1082
00:58:39,090 --> 00:58:41,610
started playing the second version or

1083
00:58:41,610 --> 00:58:43,800
the second game of Uncharted I've not

1084
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:45,750
played it and that's actually my go-to

1085
00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:49,140
right now I'm finishing up the second

1086
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:51,930
game right now charted is so much fun

1087
00:58:51,930 --> 00:58:53,010
alright I got it

1088
00:58:53,010 --> 00:58:55,320
my I don't know right now would be the

1089
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:57,270
right term but my best game of all time

1090
00:58:57,270 --> 00:59:00,450
was blood-borne without a doubt like

1091
00:59:00,450 --> 00:59:03,150
100% blood-borne is my favorite of all

1092
00:59:03,150 --> 00:59:07,200
stuff and he's been on the same boss for

1093
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:11,280
like that's the one that Joe really got

1094
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:12,960
into those kinds of games I think our

1095
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:14,700
souls maybe Joe didn't understand the

1096
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:18,690
story or something or I don't know I was

1097
00:59:18,690 --> 00:59:20,730
so excited to see Joe get into it to

1098
00:59:20,730 --> 00:59:22,290
blood-borne and he went way past where I

1099
00:59:22,290 --> 00:59:26,330
went so yeah as far as my game right now

1100
00:59:26,330 --> 00:59:28,650
unfortunately just because I go so many

1101
00:59:28,650 --> 00:59:30,150
different things I don't get to play

1102
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:31,950
anything leisurely anymore it's always

1103
00:59:31,950 --> 00:59:33,870
for the show he's doing a little bit of

1104
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:37,410
Far Cry 5 with Joe and then we're gonna

1105
00:59:37,410 --> 00:59:39,900
start right away work on God of War if

1106
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:41,370
we ever get a review copy probably not

1107
00:59:41,370 --> 00:59:42,630
will have to get it when it comes out

1108
00:59:42,630 --> 00:59:44,940
he's crossed yeah fingers crossed that

1109
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:47,010
that that is good because I never had

1110
00:59:47,010 --> 00:59:48,150
the PlayStation you know I was always

1111
00:59:48,150 --> 00:59:49,650
I'm being I'll admit it to you guys I

1112
00:59:49,650 --> 00:59:51,240
was an Xbox fan boy for the longest time

1113
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:54,810
and yeah and that's why in that video I

1114
00:59:54,810 --> 00:59:56,850
was so passionate and so determined to

1115
00:59:56,850 --> 00:59:58,830
get in front of Major Nelson or anybody

1116
00:59:58,830 --> 01:00:00,450
at Microsoft really and tell them hey

1117
01:00:00,450 --> 01:00:02,070
this is not what we want and can you

1118
01:00:02,070 --> 01:00:04,140
guys not do this because it's the wrong

1119
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:05,370
decision it's gonna hurt you in the long

1120
01:00:05,370 --> 01:00:09,600
run and I say got in there and I gave my

1121
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:11,580
opinion and I think I think we know what

1122
01:00:11,580 --> 01:00:14,130
happened and you know and and how it

1123
01:00:14,130 --> 01:00:16,740
turned out so I just you know I get now

1124
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:18,840

say grow thicker skin during the

1182
01:02:55,030 --> 01:02:59,230
beginning because I initially I thought

1183
01:02:59,230 --> 01:03:00,700
I would say don't read the

1184
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:03,010
comments but that's not me man that's

1185

part of it keeps you going

1186
01:03:05,290 --> 01:03:07,900

1192
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:18,520
get the real bad ones that will like

1193
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:20,410
make you think about yourself at night

1194
01:03:20,410 --> 01:03:23,250
but but at but it's funny because those

1195
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:26,140
must keep coming back I study the stats

1196
01:03:26,140 --> 01:03:29,650
in the dashboard and so in their own you

1197
01:03:29,650 --> 01:03:31,750
know kind of twisted way they they want

1198
01:03:31,750 --> 01:03:34,599
you to succeed too so so I don't want to

1199
01:03:34,599 --> 01:03:36,310
say don't read them but just have

1200
01:03:36,310 --> 01:03:38,320
thicker skin and realize that a lot of

1201
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:39,820
the time when somebody makes a comment

1202
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:41,320

[Applause]

1232
01:04:57,329 --> 01:05:02,199
all right so we've had the show for like

1233
01:05:02,199 --> 01:05:04,660
I don't have you know it's fine we could

1234
01:05:04,660 --> 01:05:06,789
just have owed a model yeah so we've had

1235
01:05:06,789 --> 01:05:08,589
the show for like eight or ten years and

1236
01:05:08,589 --> 01:05:11,439
we never officially got merch yeah let

1237
01:05:11,439 --> 01:05:13,089
me let me jump in here I you know I

1238
01:05:13,089 --> 01:05:15,069
don't know if you recent youtubers they

1239
01:05:15,069 --> 01:05:16,509
like March March March March

1240
01:05:16,509 --> 01:05:20,109
and for the past ten years I just feel

1241
01:05:20,109 --> 01:05:22,809
awkward you know promoting myself and

1242
01:05:22,809 --> 01:05:25,329
things and over time I realized that you

1243
01:05:25,329 --> 01:05:26,890
don't have to because the haters are

1244
01:05:26,890 --> 01:05:29,439
Cupid order you charge you know 1995

1245
01:05:29,439 --> 01:05:31,449
reassured about your show and things

1246
01:05:31,449 --> 01:05:33,189
like that and and it supports your show

1247
01:05:33,189 --> 01:05:35,229
and I've started to realize that it

1248
01:05:35,229 --> 01:05:36,549
could be another advice if you're

1249
01:05:36,549 --> 01:05:37,719
starting and what you could do

1250
01:05:37,719 --> 01:05:39,519
differently is don't be afraid to

1251
01:05:39,519 --> 01:05:41,769
promote yourself nobody is gonna promote

1252
01:05:41,769 --> 01:05:43,839
yourself especially if you don't promote

1253
01:05:43,839 --> 01:05:46,509
yourself so I think it's it's perfectly

1254
01:05:46,509 --> 01:05:49,089
fine to do and find partners who are

1255
01:05:49,089 --> 01:05:50,799
willing to get you know do March or

1256
01:05:50,799 --> 01:05:52,869
whatever to help generate another

1257
01:05:52,869 --> 01:05:54,640
revenue stream for you especially in

1258
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:56,709
YouTube cuz it's getting crazy out there

1259
01:05:56,709 --> 01:05:58,599
and and it's getting a little worried

1260
01:05:58,599 --> 01:06:02,559
sometimes so go ahead down so I looked

1261
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:04,449
around for a long time to find something

1262
01:06:04,449 --> 01:06:06,069
that would like be on equality where

1263
01:06:06,069 --> 01:06:09,219
exactly so and so it took me a long time

1264
01:06:09,219 --> 01:06:11,709
but so this is unofficial as of right

1265
01:06:11,709 --> 01:06:14,769
this second wink but we went with a

1266
01:06:14,769 --> 01:06:16,660

1284

01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:00,440
attack us I don't know what it is you

1287

1288
01:07:01,609 --> 01:07:03,440
we're all walking together we always

1289
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:05,089
like clash with the other people walking

1290
01:07:05,089 --> 01:07:06,950
the other way it looks local anyway so

1291
01:07:06,950 --> 01:07:09,290
but could I say can I mention that one

1292
01:07:09,290 --> 01:07:11,420
secret thing that they were working on

1293
01:07:11,420 --> 01:07:14,450
is that yeah go for it I drop it okay so

1294
01:07:14,450 --> 01:07:16,460
say one of my dreams I was like okay if

1295
01:07:16,460 --> 01:07:19,670
I'm gonna do merchandise I want to do

1296
01:07:19,670 --> 01:07:21,170
the best merchants you guys know I put

1297
01:07:21,170 --> 01:07:23,660
110% in everything I do and no company

1298
01:07:23,660 --> 01:07:25,130
has been able to do it but this one and

1299
01:07:25,130 --> 01:07:26,960
they may not be able to but we'll see

1300
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:30,589
can actually make an angry Joe jacket so

1301
01:07:30,589 --> 01:07:32,390
that you can have your own double white

1302
01:07:32,390 --> 01:07:35,420
stripes and that shit will be awesome

1303
01:07:35,420 --> 01:07:38,480
cuz you know this jacket is cool anyway

1304
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:41,119
for so many years it served me well you

1305
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:42,560
know the ladies that are like why is

1306
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:44,630
this guys you know attractive built and

1307
01:07:44,630 --> 01:07:46,960
then I take the jacket off in the world

1308
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:49,910
so you too can be as attractive as a

1309
01:07:49,910 --> 01:07:52,490
fake attractive is angry Joe when he

1310
01:07:52,490 --> 01:07:56,770
made videos five five years ago alright

1311
01:07:56,770 --> 01:08:00,980
oh yes sir so I just have the question

1312
01:08:00,980 --> 01:08:04,250
so you're a big Superman fan what is

1313
01:08:04,250 --> 01:08:12,859

1315
01:08:20,089 --> 01:08:22,549
it is it's on it's with a you where

1316
01:08:22,549 --> 01:08:24,230
basically he's a vegetarian and he's

1317
01:08:24,230 --> 01:08:26,569
flying over a flock of sheep or

1318
01:08:26,569 --> 01:08:28,279
something like that and it's got lex

1319
01:08:28,279 --> 01:08:29,960
luthor in it when they grew up together

1320
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:32,359
i forget what that one's called but that

1321
01:08:32,359 --> 01:08:34,790
was one of my favorites i just really

1322
01:08:34,790 --> 01:08:39,089
nervous it's a red Sun Superman

1323
01:08:39,089 --> 01:08:41,720
I love that basically I love any

1324
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:45,450
anything having to do with Superman I'm

1325
01:08:45,450 --> 01:08:47,460
trying to think of some bad Superman

1326
01:08:47,460 --> 01:08:47,850
ones

1327
01:08:47,850 --> 01:08:51,030
Linkara my boy who reviews comic books

1328
01:08:51,030 --> 01:08:52,859
has some really good ones or Superman's

1329
01:08:52,859 --> 01:08:55,290
using guns and stuff like that that are

1330
01:08:55,290 --> 01:08:57,900
terrible and I hate those you also watch

1331
01:08:57,900 --> 01:08:58,859
his videos because they're so

1332
01:08:58,859 --> 01:09:03,720
entertaining but yeah thanks I wish I

1333
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:08,940
had a better answer for you so this is

1334
01:09:08,940 --> 01:09:10,290
kind of a question for all three of you

1335
01:09:10,290 --> 01:09:12,510
um I know you've at least playing

1336
01:09:12,510 --> 01:09:14,490
Fallout Joe and I was wondering if they

1337
01:09:14,490 --> 01:09:15,839
are gonna make another fallout where

1338
01:09:15,839 --> 01:09:17,310
would you like to see them go it's in

1339
01:09:17,310 --> 01:09:19,440
New Vegas they obviously had Vegas and

1340
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:21,600
more desert II area and then four they

1341
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:24,270
had the different swamps and nice parts

1342
01:09:24,270 --> 01:09:25,140
of Boston

1343
01:09:25,140 --> 01:09:26,970
I was just great this is cool because I

1344
01:09:26,970 --> 01:09:29,460
did I do have an idea for that I want to

1345
01:09:29,460 --> 01:09:32,040
see the greater war or whatever what

1346
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:34,740
will happen we saw we saw a piece of

1347
01:09:34,740 --> 01:09:36,120
that at the beginning we were running in

1348
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:38,280
the suburbia or whatever it was the 22

1349
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:40,410
minute war and and I was like man it

1350
01:09:40,410 --> 01:09:41,550
would be cool if one of these days we

1351
01:09:41,550 --> 01:09:43,500
got to like travel - well I think they

1352
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:45,000
kind of did a little bit of that in some

1353
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,680
of the DLC but you know where you get to

1354
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:47,970
travel to the other countries that

1355
01:09:47,970 --> 01:09:50,089
supposedly we went to war with like that

1356
01:09:50,089 --> 01:09:54,180
or maybe just an area out you know on

1357
01:09:54,180 --> 01:09:56,280
the planet that we've never done you all

1358
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:58,830
go underwater what's going on with all

1359
01:09:58,830 --> 01:10:00,930
those creatures in it is are they being

1360
01:10:00,930 --> 01:10:02,790
affected by by the fallout deep

1361
01:10:02,790 --> 01:10:06,600
underwater Oceana so an island mix it up

1362
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:08,190
with far like try China because they

1363
01:10:08,190 --> 01:10:10,320
were also affected yeah exactly I would

1364
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:11,820
love to see something like that yeah

1365
01:10:11,820 --> 01:10:16,110
all right so for me Chicago mainly

1366
01:10:16,110 --> 01:10:18,000
because they did a few games in Chicago

1367
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,680
and that's the last place the Enclave is

1368
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:22,410
and the Chicago is all super mutants so

1369
01:10:22,410 --> 01:10:24,090
I think doing Chicago would be really

1370
01:10:24,090 --> 01:10:25,710
really good for them to do because you'd

1371
01:10:25,710 --> 01:10:27,840
have the enclave again the Brotherhood

1372
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:29,490
the West Brotherhood which broke off a

1373
01:10:29,490 --> 01:10:31,470
long time ago and you'd have like tons

1374
01:10:31,470 --> 01:10:33,150
of super mutants and talking deathclaws

1375
01:10:33,150 --> 01:10:35,910
which is pretty great I would want to

1376
01:10:35,910 --> 01:10:39,330
see Tokyo Japan that'd be amazing Japan

1377
01:10:39,330 --> 01:10:43,440
oh yeah oh hell yes good the biggest one

1378
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:44,850
I don't know who be soft if you're

1379
01:10:44,850 --> 01:10:47,040
watching or listening I want you know I

1380
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:48,900
don't really play Assassin's Creed too

1381
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:50,610
much anymore the latest one has

1382
01:10:50,610 --> 01:10:53,250
it's it's things but it was cool and it

1383
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:53,910
looks amazing

1384
01:10:53,910 --> 01:10:57,750
I want Japan please give me ninjas and

1385
01:10:57,750 --> 01:11:00,480
samurais and I will play that and I'll

1386
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:02,430
make a review hopefully it's good and

1387
01:11:02,430 --> 01:11:04,680
tell everybody to buy it because Japan

1388
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:06,150
and you know what's crazy I was talking

1389
01:11:06,150 --> 01:11:07,560
with the guy that he was like the CEO or

1390
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:09,090
something usually super important cuz he

1391
01:11:09,090 --> 01:11:10,230
had a bunch of people around him and I

1392
01:11:10,230 --> 01:11:11,970
said and it made the suggestion while we

1393
01:11:11,970 --> 01:11:14,220
were playing Egypt or another one and

1394
01:11:14,220 --> 01:11:16,080
and when I said Japan he just started

1395
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:18,930
smiling really big and I don't know if

1396
01:11:18,930 --> 01:11:21,570
that means anything but he's just so big

1397
01:11:21,570 --> 01:11:23,460
but anyway I do want to mention this you

1398
01:11:23,460 --> 01:11:25,670

1399
