1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,949
y'all started work inside legit abt

2
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:04,140
hopefully you guys are all good now over

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:05,970
a week has passed since the fight since

4
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:08,130
the big fight I mean this fight was huge

5
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:10,260
it was all over mainstream press all

6
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,210
over social media and I think it was

7
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,790
insane that this was even able to happen

8
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:17,670
two very very big youtubers colliding

9
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,710
and creating such a memorable event

10
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,170
history was made and I'm glad to be a

11
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,090
part of it to be honest anyway as you

12
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,460
can see from the title of this video I'm

13
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,590
here to explain why I won the fight

14
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,679
judges got it wrong straight up like

15
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:35,489
absolute BS i watch the fight again and

16
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:39,149
again and again and I just can't see how

17
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:41,670
I didn't win one of the judges got it

18
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:45,000
right and then two draws please miss me

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,129
with our bullshit where I wanted to find

20
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:51,120
Logan beat me three four five and six

21
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,829
come on and we're gonna go through the

22
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:54,750
fight together bit by bit and I'm going

23
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,629
to explain to you why I feel I won the

24
00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:01,129
fight before I get to that Logan is

25
00:01:01,129 --> 00:01:03,809
video oh my god

26
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:05,610
now with that said I thought I won the

27
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,770
fight I thought I won 4-2 I thought I'd

28
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:11,220
won rounds 1 2 3 and 5 ksi hands down

29
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,950
took the fourth round and obviously the

30
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,070
6th round where he'd just he fucked me

31
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,689
up back in a line that was me just

32
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:21,240
trying to stay alive I was completely

33
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,869
out of gas you know what let me just go

34
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:27,060
through this and then I explained how I

35
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:32,159
won the fight so understand why he was

36
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,530
wearing this whole fucking Baima thing

37
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:36,630
you weighted strongest baby motherfucker

38
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,030
I said for those wondering what Moscow's

39
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,950
wearing is actually similar to Cass is

40
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:41,220
dead

41
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,399
really good MC check him out but I

42
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,049
thought it looked cool as fuck oh yes

43
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:47,939
the nightmare blah blah blah so I wanted

44
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:49,229
to add something different to my room

45
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:50,700
walking said listen if you look at the

46
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,890
whole of this like it's incredible like

47
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:55,229
I don't know I'm just I never I never

48
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:57,329
actually got to take it in because

49
00:01:57,329 --> 00:01:58,380
obviously when you find out what you

50
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,899
think you know is essentially fighting

51
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:02,909
you're not thinking about the crowds

52
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:04,740
you're not thinking about you know the

53
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,719
millions people watching online you're

54
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,970
just there like okay I have my opponent

55
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:09,490
I'm going

56
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:11,350
take him out you got Michael buffer just

57
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:14,410
chillin Islam man it's just got such a

58
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:17,320
cool boys man he's such a nice person

59
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:24,240
saw a man backstage he's so cool

60
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,690
so that's uh Logan's like team whoever I

61
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:32,500
was just staring at like I'd want what

62
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:39,610
are you all gonna do all right

63
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:44,110
round one so we round one I was kind of

64
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:46,870
just feeling Logan out you've got to

65
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,730
remember let me just pause it real quick

66
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:51,940
you gotta remember that I had no footage

67
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:54,760
of Logan I had no footage of Logan

68
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,580
training no footage of Logan sparring I

69
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:01,090
mean if you count the TMZ sparring thing

70
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:04,480
then whoever but hardly anything to go

71
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,880
off by so that first round was me

72
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,550
figuring out how Logan fights I didn't

73
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:11,200
want to use too much energy I just

74
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,790
wanted to see where he was that

75
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:15,760
instantly I knew okay he's got a he's

76
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,880
got a really good long jab so I knew I

77
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,740
wasn't gonna be able to trade for trades

78
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,900
so if he jabs and I job at the same time

79
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,910
I knew he was gonna beat me every time

80
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,980
so I had to time it a bit more so that's

81
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,330
why I was just trying to be a lot more

82
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:30,070
cautious at the beginning I'm out

83
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:33,730
partying away all his jabs see him was

84
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:36,910
that doing a few faints just to see what

85
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:39,910
he does whenever I try certain movements

86
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:42,940
a few body shots they're just aiming to

87
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,220
you know slow him down

88
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,420
obviously I need us a lot of body to

89
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,400
work with so that's where I was gonna be

90
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,580
aiming for a lot again just slipping his

91
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:55,480
so notice how I defend the jab so I um

92
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,580
see at the beginning I was palming away

93
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,770
and then I was alright let me switch it

94
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:01,750
up with just slipping it here in there I

95
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,730
was trying to I was just there like come

96
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:05,850
on bro is this all you got

97
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:08,440
so I want I wanted to see him like

98
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,780
really try to attack me but you know he

99
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:13,240
had a really good job like a really good

100
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,820
job I gotta give him that again a bit

101
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,830
while there but I was like cool cool got

102
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:21,250
it nine nine and shit I was like come on

103
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:21,760
man

104
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,030
so I

105
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:25,910
moment I realized okay so he's a

106
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:28,160
counter-puncher this guy is going to

107
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,950
wait for me to attack he's not going to

108
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:33,200
attack me he's going to wait for me so I

109
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,650
was like cool okay noted a lot of times

110
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:39,620
I had to just hit him to make him do

111
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:42,260
something so as you can see he's gonna

112
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,419
he takes his time he really doesn't want

113
00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:46,310
to attack but it got me that were good

114
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:49,070
right really good right there but

115
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:51,950
obviously I I can eat punches for days

116
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:54,440
so again he kept plucking with that jab

117
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,780
and I was like all right this job is

118
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,180
clearly gonna be a problem so so

119
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,800
obviously right now this is his round

120
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,840
he's he's currently being me still I

121
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,640
didn't want to use too much energy I

122
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:08,600
wanted to take my time and just you know

123
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,760
take it easy so again more body shots

124
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,550
just trying to just again slow him down

125
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,560
cuz I knew that I was going to make a

126
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,479
lot of difference in the later rounds I

127
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:19,430
was smiling because I said like you're

128
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:23,210
like this is calm I can I've got I've

129
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:25,639
got this Jessie way another body shot

130
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:27,380
notice how I'm just constantly going for

131
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,060
his body obviously he was getting me so

132
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,410
you know he started being a bit cocky

133
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,660
but you know that wasn't gonna face me I

134
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:35,150
don't know that shit never affects me I

135
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:37,190
was just there like just you wait just

136
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,840
you wait all right so at this point I

137
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,539
realized I'm gonna need to put a bit of

138
00:05:41,539 --> 00:05:43,340
pressure on him and figure out how to

139
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,410
get on the inside so obviously it's a

140
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:47,150
smaller fighter going on the inside

141
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:49,340
you're gonna have to take a punch to

142
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:51,470
give free so when drawing on the inside

143
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:55,010
I wanted to protect myself to make sure

144
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:57,130
I don't get caught because I'm obviously

145
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:59,960
going into his punches obviously this is

146
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,500
his round he you know he did what I

147
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,690
needed to do keep me at a distance

148
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:08,930
whenever I came in he you know just hit

149
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:11,930
me away with that job so I was like

150
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:14,720
alright cool I was a few good punches

151
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,700
there so yeah he got he got me he got me

152
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,140
there pretty good so I was there like

153
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,780
come on then let's go come on as I

154
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:26,510
please show me what you go hey again

155
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:29,740
just pain so I was like cool whatever

156
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:33,169
so yeah that's definitely his round he

157
00:06:33,169 --> 00:06:35,009
did well

158
00:06:35,009 --> 00:06:36,809
he did what he needed to do for that

159
00:06:36,809 --> 00:06:38,339
play I thought sure to remember what

160
00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:42,269
Vidal told me he's also focused but uh

161
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:44,339
pretty much all I remember is him

162
00:06:44,339 --> 00:06:45,119
telling me

163
00:06:45,119 --> 00:06:47,999
left hook left hook it's dad it's dad I

164
00:06:47,999 --> 00:06:49,199
was like all right cool

165
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:54,299
so your boy always first up first up on

166
00:06:54,299 --> 00:06:56,519
the ring like my stamina and condition

167
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:58,439
is always on point so I always made sure

168
00:06:58,439 --> 00:06:59,999
that Fitness is number one because that

169
00:06:59,999 --> 00:07:02,069
essentially is what wins you fight all

170
00:07:02,069 --> 00:07:03,539
right round two

171
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:06,539
as I gonna have to put a bit more

172
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:08,579
pressure on but again I didn't want to

173
00:07:08,579 --> 00:07:12,269
go to to ham because it's round two we

174
00:07:12,269 --> 00:07:13,859
got six rounds we've got plenty of time

175
00:07:13,859 --> 00:07:16,679
so as you can see at the beginning I'm

176
00:07:16,679 --> 00:07:17,969
starting to put a lot more pressure on

177
00:07:17,969 --> 00:07:20,159
as I you know give him the jab and the

178
00:07:20,159 --> 00:07:24,269
cross and then uh I've got to admit man

179
00:07:24,269 --> 00:07:28,949
this boy loves to clinch all my gosh

180
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:31,739
you'll see I get so frustrated with it

181
00:07:31,739 --> 00:07:33,389
and the referee tells me off for it

182
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:35,819
because I'm flooring him across but

183
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:38,729
that's all because he kept clinching me

184
00:07:38,729 --> 00:07:41,669
and I I fuckin hate a is pissing me off

185
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,919
as I gave me a body shot there I was

186
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:47,579
like cool cool and so I'm doing a lot

187
00:07:47,579 --> 00:07:50,849
more faint because I'm trying to I'm

188
00:07:50,849 --> 00:07:54,749
trying to icon there I did very well but

189
00:07:54,749 --> 00:07:56,999
I did a lot more faints to try and get

190
00:07:56,999 --> 00:07:59,189
him to jab just so I could slip on her

191
00:07:59,189 --> 00:08:01,229
and you know create some create some

192
00:08:01,229 --> 00:08:03,599
openings so I was really wild without

193
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,359
right hand but I realized that the

194
00:08:06,359 --> 00:08:09,209
overhand is working because he's

195
00:08:09,209 --> 00:08:12,869
probably used to very traditional way of

196
00:08:12,869 --> 00:08:15,059
flying so if I made it scrappy

197
00:08:15,059 --> 00:08:17,099
I knew he wasn't gonna be able to deal

198
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:20,249
with it so boom again me being wild but

199
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:23,219
this I realized I needed to be wild so I

200
00:08:23,219 --> 00:08:25,469
was like cool alright take my time take

201
00:08:25,469 --> 00:08:28,639
my time just trying to figure him out

202
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:33,059
oh-oh again he's just a fucking counter

203
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:35,189
puncher mind it's shit

204
00:08:35,189 --> 00:08:37,499
I hate fighting counter punches because

205
00:08:37,499 --> 00:08:40,079
literally all they do is wait they just

206
00:08:40,079 --> 00:08:41,819
they're like I'm just gonna wait for you

207
00:08:41,819 --> 00:08:44,699
to throw throw so I can counter like

208
00:08:44,699 --> 00:08:46,379
fucking hell alright it's not like I

209
00:08:46,379 --> 00:08:47,940
haven't fought Kyle punches before

210
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,600
I always follow counterpunches so so

211
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,090
okay I so I came while the right hand

212
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:57,630
and that he counted me with the cost of

213
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:59,730
his own and yeah I'll give it now it was

214
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:02,310
a good shot sorry I'm gonna have to so

215
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:05,880
now I know is how no it's my movement

216
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,740
notice how I'm moving I'm just they're

217
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,360
like okay I'm starting to get into this

218
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,370
now I wanted to show him that you know

219
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:14,160
like I haven't turned up yet this is

220
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,230
just gear one right now so I was like

221
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:19,230
cool cool bouncing around showing I'm I

222
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:21,540
still I'm still full of energy

223
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:24,600
I'm just trying to circle sock around

224
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,090
it's just jab good left and right there

225
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:29,220
again good job there as well this is

226
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,320
definitely Israel like he's beating me

227
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,450
this round but right now these two

228
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:35,670
rounds me just downloading all the

229
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:38,580
information I needed to download to beat

230
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,650
him I got to remind you guys that I have

231
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:43,440
never seen Logan box I have never seen

232
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,050
minutes of Logan sparring only seconds

233
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:47,280
so I was just trying to see what works

234
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,750
and what doesn't so that's why I was

235
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,700
using one wanted to just to download all

236
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,080
the information that I need to download

237
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:58,860
okay may fucking hell Joe shut the fuck

238
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,310
up that's another thing Joe pissed me

239
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:08,850
off with the commentary geez I think I

240
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:17,820
do another body shot here soon Joe deals

241
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:21,690
like your case I I didn't know and then

242
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:25,770
Joe gives it a few seconds and then just

243
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:29,220
goes no it doesn't yeah I do a body shot

244
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,300
alright cool

245
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,150
he's expecting body shot so every noise

246
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:36,870
I'm there like faint up body shot faint

247
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:39,480
up body shot now what's why I do here

248
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:44,370
now did you see that so he was expecting

249
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:47,490
another body shot psych right hand to

250
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,560
the fucking face I realize I just needed

251
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,500
to up the levels as well and then boom

252
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,589
nice right but then I felt I started

253
00:10:55,589 --> 00:10:57,540
fucked up there so I felt up there

254
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,730
because I didn't expect him to return so

255
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:00,529
quickly I was

256
00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:02,239
okay I've hit him hard without right

257
00:11:02,239 --> 00:11:04,669
clearly this guy is uh you know he's a

258
00:11:04,669 --> 00:11:07,369
bit of a beast so he came out like no I

259
00:11:07,369 --> 00:11:08,929
didn't fucking face me

260
00:11:08,929 --> 00:11:11,029
I came through hard but you could tell

261
00:11:11,029 --> 00:11:14,509
that da ha as I see there real quick

262
00:11:14,509 --> 00:11:17,959
notice how he shakes his jewel look yeah

263
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:19,789
he's no I say he died not hard that

264
00:11:19,789 --> 00:11:22,849
right hand huh but he knew he needs to

265
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,709
make sure he looked like he was winning

266
00:11:24,709 --> 00:11:28,789
the round with a good return so okay so

267
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:33,649
now you're probably wondering why did I

268
00:11:33,649 --> 00:11:36,409
hit him after the bell well ladies and

269
00:11:36,409 --> 00:11:38,389
gentlemen it's because this motherfucker

270
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:40,429
hit me twice after the bell but you

271
00:11:40,429 --> 00:11:43,279
don't see it so I'll show you obviously

272
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,709
mine was very obvious because we stopped

273
00:11:45,709 --> 00:11:49,129
throwing and then I am experienced

274
00:11:49,129 --> 00:11:50,449
that's my bad I shouldn't have done that

275
00:11:50,449 --> 00:11:52,429
I got a bit annoyed at the fact that he

276
00:11:52,429 --> 00:11:55,609
did that so the bells wrong he's hit me

277
00:11:55,609 --> 00:11:58,459
once and then he's hit me again with his

278
00:11:58,459 --> 00:12:00,259
fucking right and I'm there right now

279
00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:06,319
made by David him hard man it's a little

280
00:12:06,319 --> 00:12:10,479

Goody - look out look out she stopped

283
00:12:18,139 --> 00:12:20,899

284
00:12:20,899 --> 00:12:23,239
he stopped himself he ran into the

285
00:12:23,239 --> 00:12:26,959
middle of the Ring oh wow this

286
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,519
motherfucker wasn't gonna do shit

287
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:33,739
round three eyed him with a few body

288
00:12:33,739 --> 00:12:35,629
shots oh I knew he was starting to tire

289
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:38,089
so I was all right cool this is time to

290
00:12:38,089 --> 00:12:40,579
really put on the pressure now so why is

291
00:12:40,579 --> 00:12:43,849
referee telling me to you know not him

292
00:12:43,849 --> 00:12:46,009
off through the bell now why didn't he

293
00:12:46,009 --> 00:12:47,599
do after round two why do you have to

294
00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:50,239
wait till round three started to tell me

295
00:12:50,239 --> 00:12:52,309

00:12:54,169 --> 00:12:56,059
time to rest and I was there like okay

298
00:12:56,059 --> 00:12:57,679

299
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:59,929
alright alright 15 seconds wasted and

300
00:12:59,929 --> 00:13:02,449
then we've started alright so round

301
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:05,899
three this is where I realized yeah I'm

302
00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:07,999
gonna have to really start going so he

303
00:13:07,999 --> 00:13:10,879
got me there with a nice one too again I

304
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:12,580

307
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,800
really good job but that's why as you

308
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,870
can see I had to be a lot more messy so

309
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:25,870
I got a few books there again you see

310
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:27,459

311
00:13:27,459 --> 00:13:29,649

312
00:13:29,649 --> 00:13:32,110
whenever shit go home this motherfucker

313
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:36,490

was on the fucking room a lot of the

316
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,279
time in this fight but again I'd say

317
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:43,839
right now I'm winning around because of

318
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,050
him with some nice good shots nice body

319
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:51,070

321
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,339

and just miss that bro alright so what

414
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:43,750
he did well was whenever I would come

415
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,520
forward he would come forward as well

416
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,170
because he knew I was full of energy and

417
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:49,090
he knew that he was fucked so whereas

418
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:51,460
before he was playing the distance game

419
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,930
and he was doing quite well with that

420
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:55,270
especially in round 1 and 2 now because

421
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:57,010
he was tired he was struggling to deal

422
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,290
with my movement and he realized ok I'm

423
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:01,540
gonna have to close the distance so much

424
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,970
the point that he can't throw an icon

425
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:05,800
firm and that's why I was always

426
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,260
essentially under him icon with a job

427
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:10,660
they're like no just missed a lot of

428
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,670

429
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:15,340

00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:33,720
miss miss wait

434
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:38,910
replay Oh miss miss boom boom

435
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:42,190
left hook so left hook I think

436
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:44,590
enough left hooks man that was my

437
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:48,220
problem I fucked up I would be I did not

438
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,280
do enough left words I don't let more if

439
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,820
I did more left hooks I probably would

440
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,980
have dropped him so JJ why didn't you do

441
00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:01,360
enough left hooks so they stopped it

442
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,460
around - I think after round 2 I walk

443
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:06,100
back and I was there like my left hands

444
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:12,970
Fox by the way round 3 and 4 it's your

445
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:14,470
boy your boys winning it

446
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:16,840
so he's won round one and two I've won

447
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:20,140
three and four gasps this is the round

448
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:24,160
everyone goes oh you know did longer win

449
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,290
this one case I win this one I mean

450
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:28,150
hopefully we can all agree that round 1

451
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:31,480
and 2 Logan has won I'm three and four I

452
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,880
have one like let's accept that as a

453
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:37,420
fact okay 100% Logan was definitely told

454
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:39,070
here he's come back you're gonna need a

455
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:41,560
peer pressure on so that's why Logan

456
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,440
came in straight off with a good left

457
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,540
and right boom very good left and right

458
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:49,480
so I was all right cool but he's missed

459
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,770
his other shots there

460
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:53,980
a good body shot from him here with a

461
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:56,380
left palm there so right now Logan's

462
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,060
winning he's hit me with some good shots

463
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:00,190
he sent me there another good shot I

464
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:01,750
came back but right now he's still

465
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,940
winning he's hit me with good shots all

466
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:06,310
right boom I gone with a job there I

467
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:12,280
think on me too right Logan still with

468
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,990
him looking and still winning calm calm

469
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:17,710
calm calm calm body shot there for

470
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:25,660
myself what what the hell so I think the

471
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,880
ref said break and I didn't hear it it's

472
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,870
very loud in that but again the referee

473
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:34,930
lost mine was giving this motherfucker

474
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:39,160
time to rest jeez he was good he was

475
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,950
giving me a fucking lecture I was like

476
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:43,120

477
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,660
let me continue to fight Oh wild he got

478
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:49,810
me there nice so I think this is the

479
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:51,970
part where everyone was like JJ's fault

480
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:54,460
he's finished he's naked so I think I

481
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,929
come with a right and then I just

482
00:21:55,929 --> 00:22:00,940
just miss where is it so I missed so why

483
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,980
obviously he misses he misses he misses

484
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,869
but then he got me there with the right

485
00:22:04,869 --> 00:22:08,080
I returned he got me to have another

486
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:15,940

00:22:55,929 --> 00:22:58,299
everyone's like oh is it this is that

00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:02,019
ten and this is where the judges may

505
00:23:02,019 --> 00:23:04,090
have given Logan attend this is where

506
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:05,769
some of the judges could have given me a

507
00:23:05,769 --> 00:23:07,570
10 it's tight you know what I'm gonna be

508
