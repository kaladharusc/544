2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:04,890
comic-con we just saw Shazam

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:07,890
watch our reaction of that that has some

4
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:11,570
positive connotations I think maybe and

5
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:14,730
Aquaman though has me worried of old

6
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:20,910
guard Ark Snyder verse my god I need a

7
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,490
haircut so don't compare me with Jason

8
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,260
Momoa here because it's gonna be a bad

9
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,380
comparison you ready here we go please

10
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:44,129
be good 3 2 1 go Joe there's some

11
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:49,980
lightness in color there you go now the

12
00:00:49,980 --> 00:01:01,960
whole thing is colored more bullies

13
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,770
they made me what I am I'm not sure Joe

14
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm gonna talk to this for their

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,460
copyright look that CGI and then shark

16
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:27,150
did not see but see

17
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:31,420
CGI of fags does not scare me who that

18
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:36,790
be that's the trident he just looks

19
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:41,470
badass when he's in combat he has the

20
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:47,650
look no doubt whoa Helena's it looks

21
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:51,060
cool

22
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:56,950
James Wayne is a good director guys okay

23
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,320
so they're gonna fight ocean master

24
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:06,610
maybe for the throne everybody looks

25
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:10,420
like John Cena they're so powerful and

26
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:16,390
soft okay any month I was wondering how

27
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:27,680
they were gonna make that water thing

28
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:37,440
Black Manta what the hell why you got

29
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,900
two eyes bracket you got it

30
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,670
well I guess Sita has had two eyes many

31
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:57,450
times yeah okay there we go

32
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,570
so I don't know what I was talking about

33
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:03,030
freakin two eyes cuz Black Manta has

34
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,140
always had two eyes I think I was

35
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,420
thinking of a different villain but the

36
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,360
delays but there Mendham big eyes

37
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,470
because as helmets real big I'm glad

38
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,700
that they didn't really change its

39
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,040
design so let's go through this bit by

40
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,920
bit so this scared Joe man look at this

41
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,200
this is directly out of Batman V

42
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,140
Superman on this right here right but

43
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,870
then it pulls a 180 and look at this

44
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:28,680
tone color I'll go frame by frame this

45
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,040
is symbolic because this is the next

46
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,100
movie Joe so I think here they're gonna

47
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:38,010
try to turn this universe around but

48
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,470
there is an inherent darkness to this

49
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,640
film and I'll tell you this because

50
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,739
they're underwater and it's harder for

51
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:45,540
the Sun to get it up down there so I'm

52
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,519
pretty sure the scenes with Atlantis is

53
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:48,900
going to be dark but as you can see

54
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,690
plenty of color plenty of lights we're

55
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:55,170
getting the whole bully thing I just saw

56
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:57,360
this done in Shazam's trailer done

57
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,980
better and and I just said I never get

58
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,280
sick of it but I think and unless it's

59
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,590
done well and I'm sick of it right

60
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:12,110
especially here with what you have this

61
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:16,510
this really bad CGI effect

62
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:18,910
well they did have to spend a lot of CGI

63
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:22,210
on that Elena's scene right so what I'm

64
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:26,230
saying is that the CGI goes back and

65
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,820
forth at least in this trailer and it

66
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:28,810
could be they're not done

67
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,190
maybe this is all released don't come

68
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:32,890
out till December but some of it is

69
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:34,690
really good and some of it just looks a

70
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:36,970
little washed out to me this looks a

71
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:44,320
little wash down Finding Nemo trailer

72
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,630
poster okay bad guys okay

73
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:52,660
this is the Black Manta scene yes cuz I

74
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,270
think that's Black Manta back there or a

75
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,370
black ops team of some kind cuz he's

76
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:59,080
kind of wearing the same kind of black

77
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,290
armor so maybe they in Kent encountered

78
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:04,540
and that's when he meets Aquaman he's

79
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,610
like okay I need a suit that's gonna

80
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:09,040
allow me to fight this level because why

81
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,410
is Black Manta created I'm not I don't

82
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:13,390
know much about Black Manta do you so

83
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,460
I'm just kind of kind of guessing the

84
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:19,930
plotline here captain

85
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:24,100
no captain stupid what's that from

86
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:27,570
permission to come aboard captain stupid

87
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:32,920
Ventura okay so like Amber Heard yes

88
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:41,380
redhead yes superhot yep this you know

89
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:44,530
is basically a battle for the throne so

90
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:48,670
it gives me flashes of Lord of the Rings

91
00:05:48,670 --> 00:06:04,080
it gives me flashes of James Cameron's

92
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,360
Lord of the Rings and then of course the

93
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,040
comic book comic book films and a little

94
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,680
bit of the designs of like a gal Mel del

95
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,020
Toro for some of it so these are all

96
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,910
good things but we're gonna have to

97
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,860
really put aside that there's really not

98
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,600
gonna be practical effects in this much

99
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,460
oh yeah because you can't really have

100
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:27,850
that huge see these are like sea dragons

101
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:30,220
Joe sea dragons versus

102
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:36,700
fucking sharks I'm down man you know the

103
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:43,270
Sharks with the bad guys right yeah so I

104
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,340
am encouraged what are you think overall

105
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:48,370
Joe I'm open-minded to it open-minded

106
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:52,060
but it would give your honest honest

107
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:58,240
opinion is it hyped me or I think it's

108
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,860
right now it's man maybe if I see

109
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:04,150
another trailer right now just yeah it's

110
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:06,220
a lot of cool CGI and stuff but yeah

111
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:08,860
yeah I'm gonna go ahead and agree with

112
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,540
Joe's assessment I'm gonna give this a

113
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:14,740
man to as well as much as I want to be

114
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:17,020
hopeful for it and I am hopeful for it

115
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:20,110
we've been burned so many times and this

116
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,940
I think is so close to the previous

117
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:26,020
films in the DCU that it's it just feels

118
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,580
like it's in a different category than

119
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,980
Shazam and anything that comes after now

120
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:32,020
this could be the start of it and we're

121
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,490
forgetting about it I keep thinking

122
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:35,169
Shazam is gonna be the start of a change

123
00:07:35,169 --> 00:07:37,840
but this could have had some directions

124
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,220
changes some reshoots

125
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:43,350
so yeah looks good looks interesting

126
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:47,290
CGI heavy it's a little kind of washed

127
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:50,500
out it looks like people are on green

128
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:54,690
screens how do you make Aquaman cool and

129
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:58,030
this is exactly how you do it Jason

130
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:02,860
Momoa big battle scenes touch training

131
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:05,229
montage training right there for sure

132
00:08:05,229 --> 00:08:08,380
for the people who superhot love in

133
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:11,350
truth but see do you see how fakie that

134
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:14,050
looks and this one didn't really show

135
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:16,900
off a lot of a humorous it looks like an

136
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:25,789
Instagram photos doctored up

137
00:08:25,789 --> 00:08:28,499
but this is this is kind of cool we've

138
00:08:28,499 --> 00:08:32,009
not really seen sea combat like see on

139
00:08:32,009 --> 00:08:38,750
so yeah dad has me super excited okay

140
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,399
yeah see he is a part of those forces

141
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:43,709
but that wasn't Black Manta there was

142
00:08:43,709 --> 00:08:48,650
somebody else

143
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:54,420
and we have what the Atlanta's legit

144
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:59,420
Atlanteans right no they're like mermen

145
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:03,090
all I know is that our man is half human

146
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:07,290
half Atlanta I wanted to see this kind

147
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:09,450
of stuff close up cuz yeah those guys

148
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:14,430
look freaking awesome I like that there

149
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:17,220
is that actually looks pretty good I

150
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,450
don't know what that I was talking with

151
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:20,760
one eye it just said the big bulging

152
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:27,480
eyes caught me off guard job he's like

153
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:33,540
the DC Cyclops yeah that does look

154
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:41,260
pretty cool around

155
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:44,300
just so cool bad guy crimes and then

156
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:47,029
good guy or zag bad guy don't freaking

157
00:09:47,029 --> 00:09:50,240
know I think that who do you kind of

158
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,490
looks like Jason or ocean master

159
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:56,839
freaking now all right

160
00:09:56,839 --> 00:09:58,310
I'm hoping that battle lasts a lot

161
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:00,019
longer than the one we saw in the

162
00:10:00,019 --> 00:10:02,149
Justice League because that one was cool

163
00:10:02,149 --> 00:10:03,890
I wanted to see more yeah yeah but that

164
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:06,290
was too quick no this one I'd rather see

165
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:11,300
it longer this is all about it this is

166
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,649
all about that this local looks like

167
00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:15,440
it's from a television series yeah like

168
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:27,709
what do you call it W B or no CW yeah so

169
00:10:27,709 --> 00:10:29,930
apparently they love the sand as much as

170
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,550
they love the water she's diving into

171
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:35,209
the freakin sand okay alright that's

172
00:10:35,209 --> 00:10:39,980
this year Joe - 720 first like I said

173
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:44,240
open-minded yeah man I don't get myself

174
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,420
too hyped right I wanted to change my

175
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,190
rating to height but I'm gonna keep it

176
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,560
up man me just because the next trailer

177
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:56,240
that would alright guys so that's our

178
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,980
opinion on Aquaman are you more hopeful

179
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,540
than us do you think it's better or

180
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:02,750
worse than Sam in my opinion Joe I

181
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,640
thought this would get you more height

182
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,070
because there's way more battles it

183
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:08,540
looks like in this and then just you

184
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:11,510
know that constant action versus Suzanne

185
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:13,490
where it's a story about Hayes my friend

186
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:15,740
and I guess superhero powers and let's

187
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,930
test them and we're idiots and you know

188
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:19,070
what I mean oh shit

189
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:20,870
bad things are happening I better give

190
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:23,300
my shit straight yeah so we'll see

191
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,579
alright so looking up for the DC

192
00:11:25,579 --> 00:11:27,620
Universe we're hopeful and hopefully

193
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,970
we'll have some good films

194
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:42,050
just like the Marvel guys
