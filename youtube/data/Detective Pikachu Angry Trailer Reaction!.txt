45
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:46,860
so cute okay okay so obviously I'm

46
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,140
pathetic Joey I'm a grown-ass man and I

47
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:54,900
got this excited about a Pokemon does it

48
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,090
look cool or does it look creepy because

49
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:59,760
it's a little creepy to me

50
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,610
well the fur they're all furries joke

51
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:07,380
Pikachu as fur I'm so woozy I'm so used

52
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:11,130
to Pikachu being like little sleek yeah

53
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:13,920
like a little creature all but you can't

54
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:19,470
deny the thing you can't deny it no

55
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:23,580
voice so the voice so Pikachu has never

56
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:28,050
really talked before actually in 2017 I

57
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,270
think last year in the movie Pikachu I

58
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,940
choose you but could you started talking

59
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,490
don't ask me I know that job he said one

60
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:39,270
line said one line and I think it was

61
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:41,789
justified within the lore but in case

62
00:04:41,789 --> 00:04:44,100
you don't know the Lord Joe this Pikachu

63
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,190
is not Pikachu not the Pikachu the

64
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:50,490
window from Ash's Pikachu right exactly

65
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:54,630
and in fact the 3d s Pikachu has that

66
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,639
gravelly voice like a detective voice

67
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,979
wasn't Ryan Reynolds so actually casting

68
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:01,050
Ryan Reynolds after you hear the real

69
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,510
voice of detective Pikachu in the game

70
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,160
and then you hear Ryan Reynolds you're

71
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,160
like yeah that's actually great casting

72
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,889
and it's just when I first looked at it

73
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:13,200
I think Pikachu and I hear Ryan Reynolds

74
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,139
voice and you're like no no right but

75
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:22,220
it's a different he is and and a

76
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:25,919
detective so that gives this a film an

77
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,800
interesting angle like a buddy cop movie

78
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,249
as you saw there

79
00:05:30,249 --> 00:05:33,779
a little joke here now don't uh don't

80
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:36,129
expect me to remember all the names of

81
00:05:36,129 --> 00:05:39,459
the Pokemon like who is this guy mine

82
00:05:39,459 --> 00:05:41,529
okay well that's pretty easy Joe

83
00:05:41,529 --> 00:05:44,649
but when I was a kid who's your favorite

84
00:05:44,649 --> 00:05:47,829
Pokemon Joe mine was well right you what

85
00:05:47,829 --> 00:05:52,269
you better get you in the right shoes I

86
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:53,859
never do that

87
00:05:53,859 --> 00:05:58,959
I will never know he doesn't be copy

88
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:01,269
copy got you

89
00:06:01,269 --> 00:06:04,809
it's a stupid ride anyways I love the

90
00:06:04,809 --> 00:06:07,329
idea that you know you still get the P

91
00:06:07,329 --> 00:06:09,789
copy because nobody can understand him

92
00:06:09,789 --> 00:06:11,979
apparently except for this one kid they

93
00:06:11,979 --> 00:06:13,599
go on an adventure together

94
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:17,319
and you know people have been constantly

95
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:19,899
asking pokÃ©mon to evolve when the games

96
00:06:19,899 --> 00:06:21,309
comes out it's pretty much the same

97
00:06:21,309 --> 00:06:24,339
thing over and over this is a kind of an

98
00:06:24,339 --> 00:06:26,139
evolution right it's get a little

99
00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:27,669
directed a little more towards adults

100
00:06:27,669 --> 00:06:30,489
now it still has the cuteness for kids

101
00:06:30,489 --> 00:06:33,219
it's just I'm gonna have to get used to

102
00:06:33,219 --> 00:06:36,129
a furry Pikachu you know what I mean I

103
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:40,389
like smooth Pikachu you're know but I

104
00:06:40,389 --> 00:06:44,169
guess if you did a live-action it makes

105
00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:46,539
sense right cuz they're making them real

106
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:48,219
monsters you remember you remember all

107
00:06:48,219 --> 00:06:50,229
those parodies like or like pictures of

108
00:06:50,229 --> 00:06:53,919
like if Pokemon were real it was creepy

109
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,399
yeah it's kind of moving slowly into

110
00:06:57,399 --> 00:07:01,959
that yeah but the film looks like it's

111
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:03,639
gonna be pretty interesting you've got

112
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:06,719
missing pokemons you know what Joe

113
00:07:06,719 --> 00:07:10,209
gathering Pokemon probably for their

114
00:07:10,209 --> 00:07:14,229
abilities there might be Mewtwo or some

115
00:07:14,229 --> 00:07:16,749
kind of hint in here in this trailer

116
00:07:16,749 --> 00:07:18,429
about what the plotline is but you

117
00:07:18,429 --> 00:07:21,219
cannot tell me that these Bulbasaur's

118
00:07:21,219 --> 00:07:23,799
are not the cutest things ever and I'm

119
00:07:23,799 --> 00:07:26,169
sure that's a Pokemon whose name I'm not

120
00:07:26,169 --> 00:07:27,879
familiar with you let me know in the

121
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:34,770
comments this little one here that's

122
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:39,059
[Laughter]

123
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:42,189
gonna be crazy he put him to CT

124
00:07:42,189 --> 00:07:46,779
guys I wanna see that bathroom oh oh so

125
00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:48,819
I was going over I was going over my

126
00:07:48,819 --> 00:07:52,449
favorite Pokemon its Pikachu Jigglypuff

127
00:07:52,449 --> 00:07:54,580
and I'm talking about original so I

128
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,199
can't include some of the other ones and

129
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:58,779
Hitmonchan because you know you know who

130
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:01,289
Hitmonchan and him on leo named after

131
00:08:01,289 --> 00:08:04,239
Jen yes you just guessed though right

132
00:08:04,239 --> 00:08:07,209
it's Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee didn't it

133
00:08:07,209 --> 00:08:09,339
Mon chanted him on Lee but yeah that

134
00:08:09,339 --> 00:08:11,679
would it be cool if they had hitmonchan

135
00:08:11,679 --> 00:08:13,929
in this film but there are so many

136
00:08:13,929 --> 00:08:17,529
Pokemon at this point that 900-plus that

137
00:08:17,529 --> 00:08:20,229
is probably impossible to get all of

138
00:08:20,229 --> 00:08:21,969
them in there and get them featured so

139
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:23,889
another one that I like that Devon liked

140
00:08:23,889 --> 00:08:24,699
was cipher

141
00:08:24,699 --> 00:08:27,729
you remember side them anyways so yeah

142
00:08:27,729 --> 00:08:30,490
it makes me excited now are there gonna

143
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:33,149
be some bad elements I don't know I'm

144
00:08:33,149 --> 00:08:35,889
completely sold on detective Pikachu his

145
00:08:35,889 --> 00:08:38,229
voice is cute and as Ryan Reynolds but

146
00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:40,810
this guy can he carry the film can he do

147
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:45,279
his part I don't know I mean either I'm

148
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,560
not familiar with his work I think we

149
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,339
have you know another female

150
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:52,480
protagonists here not familiar with her

151
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,939
work either but the adventure they going

152
00:08:54,939 --> 00:08:57,009
I don't know the plotline of the 3ds

153
00:08:57,009 --> 00:09:01,120
game try don't spoil it in chat maybe

154
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,250
they're smart enough to be like well if

155
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:06,009
people have played the 3ds game let's

156
00:09:06,009 --> 00:09:09,310
not you know do that exact same thing

157
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:11,709
however the way they've set this up it's

158
00:09:11,709 --> 00:09:13,839
the same because it's like nobody

159
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,670
understands detective Pikachu and he's

160
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:17,439
out here trying to tell people and get

161
00:09:17,439 --> 00:09:21,009
them pew and everybody's like and he's

162
00:09:21,009 --> 00:09:22,660
like only one person understands me it's

163
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,819
this kid it's not exactly it's not

164
00:09:24,819 --> 00:09:26,439
exactly the same so I hope the plotline

165
00:09:26,439 --> 00:09:29,610
is different

166
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:33,330
this is fucking some father what's that

167
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:36,580
oh right yeah plotline and that was the

168
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,050
way in the video game too so that makes

169
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:39,700
me concerned it's the exact same thing

170
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,040
yeah because his father's missing I

171
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,690
haven't played it either so I don't even

172
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:45,040
know the conclusion but look at this

173
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,210
it's like Inception it's a Pokemon

174
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:52,930
ception but it clearly has some funny

175
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:54,730
parts and I hope this trailer hasn't

176
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:58,150
spoiled all the funny parts yeah I hate

177
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:00,220
it when that happens but there's four

178
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:00,700
anymore

179
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,190
I think it's Pokemon there's so many

180
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:05,100
things you can do with the cuteness

181
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,500
justice Smith huh okay and then I'm

182
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:12,700
trying to get this to sync up okay yeah

183
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:16,720
I think I think from what you see there

184
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,090
you're probably getting a little peek at

185
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:21,820
who the prime not gonna say anything or

186
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,470
spoiling anything for Joe you're getting

187
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:25,770
a little peek at who could possibly be

188
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:34,270
the enemy there this goes oh my god but

189
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:36,340
this is really cool here because he

190
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,500
looks freaking insane so there's going

191
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,200
to be a pokemon stadium battle between

192
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:48,550
Pikachu and Charizard there is I just

193
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,560
saw right there all right detective

194
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,710
Pikachu we are super excited about it

195
00:10:55,710 --> 00:11:00,640
good call it's gotta be PG doesn't say

196
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,700
but I guarantee you this PG yeah pretty

197
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,670
much PG 2019 don't have much of a date

198
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,260
but I'm looking forward to it you've

199
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,040

200
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,700

201

203
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:21,520

204
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,280
