1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:12,360
who honks during a traffic jam someone

2
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,889
cuts you off or starts dancing on your

3
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:15,900
car sure even the biggest asshat knows

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,130
it's not the fault of the guy in front

5
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,109
of you but if I'm in a traffic jam and

6
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:20,160
someone in front of me gets out and

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,510
starts singing and dancing you can bet

8
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:22,769
your ass I'm laying on my horn like a

9
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:24,810
road rage Rodney sorry I guess I

10
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:26,310
momentarily thought road rage rodney was

11
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,439
a thing I apologies sin still stands

12
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:30,420
though also oh sure traffic jams are an

13
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,340
LA staple these crews are stopped cold

14
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,780
for several minutes which probably means

15
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,430
there's a hideous accident up ahead but

16
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:36,750
these dancing assholes are completely

17
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:41,309
ignored dad Oh bonnet more so watching

18
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:43,710
on every doing okay I know this is a

19
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,000
Hollywood movie with a gigantic

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,710
Hollywood boner but this opening number

21
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,120
makes it look like everyone in Los

22
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,230
Angeles is either currently or

23
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:50,280
prospectively in the entertainment

24
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,260
business it's like other professions

25
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,070
there though right

26
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,090
aren't there actual doctors at the

27
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,710
hospitals for those Crizal actors

28
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,520
waiting for the big break how these

29
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,020
assholes didn't die of heat exhaustion

30
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,730
prior to now is a prequel I'd actually

31
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,409
pay money to see also this is a band

32
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:06,210
consisting of timpani stand-up bass

33
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:08,700
flute and marching band bass drum and

34
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,500
yet movie suggests everyone rallies

35
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,760
around this truck to party during the

36
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,530
traffic jam okay it looks like everybody

37
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:15,119
is having a great time I'm telling you

38
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,590
if you ride your magical appearing outta

39
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,390
nowhere bike or skateboard up on my car

40
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:20,430
playtime is over yeah but those lanes

41
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,110
down there are moving effortlessly these

42
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:23,430
assholes on the skybridge apparently

43
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,290
have no clue how to zipper merge hey

44
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:31,259
movie you're Marilyn Monroe is showing

45
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:33,130
sebastian is not only able to pull into

46
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:35,079
that left lane to properly scold mia but

47
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:36,850
also pulls to a full stop in the middle

48
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:38,259
of what's now a moving highway to give

49
00:01:38,259 --> 00:01:42,399
her the stink-eye character forgets an

50
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:43,329
appointment for one of the most

51
00:01:43,329 --> 00:01:44,679
important jobs in their life right now

52
00:01:44,679 --> 00:01:49,060
cliche Mia not only is the only person

53
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,039
in Los Angeles to own a parka with a

54
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:53,140
fur-lined hood she has it in her car and

55
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,880
can use it to cover the coffee stain at

56
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,479
a moment's notice

57
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:58,030
okay kudos to the movie for showing us

58
00:01:58,030 --> 00:01:59,829
early on that Mia actually does have

59
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:01,450
talent we see several bad auditions

60
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:03,099
later but they aren't about her talent

61
00:02:03,099 --> 00:02:04,420
it's because her heart isn't in it and

62
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,549
she's distracted so when she gets famous

63
00:02:06,549 --> 00:02:08,049
later it's totally believable because of

64
00:02:08,049 --> 00:02:10,060
this seat props also to Emma Stone for

65
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,829
making me emotional in a fake audition

66
00:02:11,829 --> 00:02:13,360
inside a movie also I'm going to go

67
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,829
ahead and take another cent off for Emma

68
00:02:14,829 --> 00:02:16,900
Stone's cry face that's a great cry face

69
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,489
right there other cry faces are gross

70
00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:20,560
and snotty this is a very clean cry face

71
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,599
that I would like to point out this

72
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:24,099
casting director and the girl that

73
00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:25,239
opened the door in the first place is

74
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:27,069
addictive terrific acting you know for

75
00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:28,150
starving artists these girls should

76
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,459
resign and looks to be a 31 year old's

77
00:02:30,459 --> 00:02:31,599
vision of how young women in Hollywood

78
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,519
should actually live Mia takes only one

79
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,349
second to wrap up this movie's pg-13

80
00:02:35,349 --> 00:02:37,060
rating so he takes time to introduce us

81
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,739
to Mia's three closest friends who later

82
00:02:38,739 --> 00:02:40,239
will play a key role in helping her

83
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:41,650
adjust to her new relationship and

84
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,000
issues oh right

85
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,170
we barely hear from them again in the

86
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:49,959
entire movie most egregious dancing in

87
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:51,430
the streets since Mick Jagger and David

88
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:53,230
Bowie man what I going to do with me it

89
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:54,730
didn't go I'm sure they'd have uber or

90
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:56,950
something they get right to Mia's car

91
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:58,870
like she called the all-time didi for

92
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,310
this orphanage of aspiring actresses

93
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,319
movie sets the reddest bathroom since

94
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,819
the shining record that no one thought

95
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:05,590
would be broken since well the shining

96
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,540
no parking sign and the entirety of Los

97
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,340
Angeles is this simple to understand I

98
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,900
promise you you basically need a degree

99
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,579
in theoretical physics and a graphing

100
00:03:12,579 --> 00:03:13,959
calculator to figure out where and when

101
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:15,459
you're allowed to park Dan Damien

102
00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:17,049
Chazelle became a master of color and

103
00:03:17,049 --> 00:03:18,459
framing seemingly before he hit puberty

104
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:20,079
which should be a sin because I'm

105
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:21,700
jealous but for this shot alone I'm

106
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,410
knocking one on this movie introduces us

107
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:25,150
to sub sister who later will play a key

108
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,290
role in helping them adjust to his new

109
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,150
relationship and issues oh wait

110
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,349
we barely hear from her again the entire

111
00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:31,840
movie does she like jazz then what are

112
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,910
we going to talk about no pop music the

113
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,470
Middle East why does your date have to

114
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,639
care as much as you do about jazz

115
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:38,799
because you're living like a hermit

116
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,690
you're driving without insurance hold

117
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:42,190
the phone there Nancy he's driving

118
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,570
without insurance that's like putting

119
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:44,319
your whole mouth

120
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,780
right in the dip oh goody now even

121
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,310
Damien Chazelle has an expanded universe

122
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,650
oh wait this shot right here of SEDs

123
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,359
reflection off the tip jar yeah it's

124
00:03:52,359 --> 00:03:53,439
going to get us in for the director

125
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:59,230
showing off this restaurant audience

126
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:00,939
sure they're just here for a family meal

127
00:04:00,939 --> 00:04:02,590
and everything but that was excellent

128
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,599
piano Inge in any context inches elicit

129
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:06,670
some sort of response so this audience

130
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:09,549
he catched for a chroma topia DOA on

131
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:11,530
23rd perp laughs and his face off at the

132
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,319
PD Dan Miranda rights this is my

133
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,810
classroom you don't like it the doors to

134
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:18,430
my left why did she suddenly get sucky

135
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,109
at acting because that guy didn't kiss

136
00:04:20,109 --> 00:04:21,729
her because of the amazing spider-man 2

137
00:04:21,729 --> 00:04:24,370
because of feelings this entire movie

138
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,110
depends on Mia attending some random

139
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:28,060
party where Sebastian is cosmically also

140
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,889
playing in the hired band this is Los

141
00:04:29,889 --> 00:04:32,169
Angeles coincidences are 10 times less

142
00:04:32,169 --> 00:04:33,460
likely out here due to sheer population

143
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:38,050
size Iran Iran a fantastic suggestion

144
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:39,970
yeah I guess Iran kind of describes

145
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:41,320
their first encounter when you blew her

146
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:41,470
off

147
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:43,120
but she seems overly confident this will

148
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,490
get under a skip and yet it does so well

149
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:47,050
I know I'm honestly surprised he even

150
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:48,610
remembers her he was so distracted that

151
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:52,210
night from being fired this is actually

152
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:53,650
the second movie co-starring Ryan

153
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:55,840
Gosling and 80s music sarcastic dancing

154
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,580
mio single-handedly provides animated

155
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:58,659
gifs for the next five years

156
00:04:58,659 --> 00:05:00,849
questing Iran from a serious musician

157
00:05:00,849 --> 00:05:02,919
it's just it's too fun right before that

158
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:04,780
you were playing take on me so are you

159
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,280
really responsible yourself here you're

160
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,990
in an 80s cover band what did you expect

161
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:12,400
Supriya I mean if that doesn't help me

162
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,860
awesome King Priya's joke moving I mean

163
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,780
seriously I was laughing so hard I had

164
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,099
to rewind the movie like a whole five

165
00:05:18,099 --> 00:05:19,840
seconds to catch up on what I missed

166
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,699
King hysterical joke get that writer a

167

raise and a half why is he dressed in a

168
00:05:23,229 --> 00:05:25,060
suit now but earlier was in a t-shirt

169
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,949
and a tease jacket is this the kind of

170
00:05:26,949 --> 00:05:28,180
game where you can play keyboard but

171
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:30,400
also then change and join the party they

172
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,139
take a suit in the bag to every gig just

173
00:05:32,139 --> 00:05:34,000
in case he meets Emma Stone a movie here

brought her comfortable shoes to the

176
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:38,169
event tonight but waited until mid song

177
00:05:38,169 --> 00:05:39,940
to actually change them after she'd walk

and this is the moment I felt goosebumps

181
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,129
from my love of old-school Hollywood

182

another sin off hey it almost won Best

praising some straight-to-video bull

that partying after that adorable ass

dance without getting her phone number

188
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:01,210
is she double clicking that tablet in

00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:03,249
the same place with her fingernail on a

190

clearly blank screen he doesn't know how

to iPad

00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:09,099
to change into because I'm pretty sure

194
00:06:09,099 --> 00:06:10,389
she was just wearing black pants

195
00:06:10,389 --> 00:06:13,509
I hate dad she says she hates jazz and

196
00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:15,430
then we get this jazzy jazzy montage of

197
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:17,379
juicing the jazz and well I want these

198
00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:18,639
two to get together as much as the movie

199
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,319
does I cannot condone the forcing of

200
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,029
jazz on those who do not get jazz or

201
00:06:22,029 --> 00:06:25,990
wish to get jazz dying tiny it had its

202
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:28,120
time indeed it did and while I don't

203
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,830
wish for jazz to die I do think it's a

204
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,569
minority genre that needs to play to its

205
00:06:31,569 --> 00:06:33,009
core audience to stay relevant as

206
00:06:33,009 --> 00:06:34,629
opposed to trying to grow wait so they

were just walking together on the Warner

Brothers lot when Sebastian said what

209
00:06:37,749 --> 00:06:39,189
are you doing right now but then they

210
00:06:39,189 --> 00:06:40,899
went all the way down to this Lighthouse

211
00:06:40,899 --> 00:06:43,270
Cafe which is in Carrozza Beach almost

212
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,770
an hour away and it's a cool shot of

213
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:46,029
them walking in different directions but

looking for a cab I'm glad she's happy

is she going to run there in heels the

between the projector and the screen and

224

no one even flinches she should be

ducking Milk Duds and ice cubes by this

point this slow bill the hand-holding

scene is adorable but it reminds me too

228
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,360
much of my college girlfriend Molly who

229
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,680
after an awesome date with a similar

230
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,749
slow handhold romance moment proceeded

231
00:07:13,749 --> 00:07:15,219
to say good night to me and then still

232
00:07:15,219 --> 00:07:17,229
somehow suck off some townie named Jared

233
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:18,399
in the alley before calling it a night

234
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:19,959
and a memory like that could only mean

235
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:22,410
sins for a movie like this sorry

237
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:28,140
what are the odds that a film burn would

00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,670
occur in the projection booth just as

239

these two are about to kiss for the

first time no seriously give me those

odds because they're astronomical for

sure no that is not a driveway and no

that is not a parking space it just

244
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:39,180
looks more cinematic than the beat-up

that's just off screen if she's really

things about this movies reality but

attention to just barely not know what's

going on yet because I am too famous and

important to still give my work 100% of

my full attention these days dunno so

ate too many helium cookies or maybe

gradual transition from traditionalist

00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,210
month-long engagement or you know go

332
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:36,260
digital with your marketing yell why

333
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,550
would they even turn on the house lights

334
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:39,500
for a curtain call you keep the stage

335
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,850
lights up so the audience would clearly

336
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,860
see the actor but in this case movie

337
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,300
really wants to put the knife on how

338
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,730
cringy this is also the single biggest

339
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,320
mystery of this movie is how an unknown

340
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,640
one of the actress staged her own

341
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,710
one-woman show for one night only and

342
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:53,510
actually had people show up seriously

343
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:55,010
try putting on your own one-person show

344
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:56,780
in LA is a nobody and see what happens

345
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,040
it'll be the polar opposite of the magic

346
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,510
this girl encounters that's for sure and

347
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:00,920
worse than that she's actually gonna get

348
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,660
famous after this one of the nine people

349
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,700
who saw this show was so moved as to get

350
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,290
me on an audition for a major movie role

351
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,150
just think being true to result and

352
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,680
playing to an audience of nine paid off

353
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,270
for so obviously you should similarly

354
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,650
ditch wisdom and pursue your foolish

355
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:15,140
dreams including a job if YouTube trolls

356
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,370
actually left the house and went to

357
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:20,510
place in Brant the casting director she

358
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:22,460
was at your play she was one of the nine

359
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,930
people who showed up because Hollywood

360
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:25,310
casting directors give the finger to

361
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:26,660
math and ODS when going out to scout

362
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,460
local talent and attend mostly one woman

363
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,810
or one man shows that have little to no

364
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:38,840
word about yeah she stops in here but

365
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,090
blush Sebastien drove from mother to Los

366
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:42,800
Angeles to Boulder City but gave me a

367
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,420
six seconds after pulling up to the

368
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,800
house in the morning he's trusting this

369
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,570
drive back to LA for the most important

370
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:49,730
audition of her life - this car Sky's

371
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:51,620
part of a successful jazz hip-hop fusion

372
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:51,980
band

373
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,720
somehow and they were on tour for so

374
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,550
long it broke these two up basically and

375
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:57,050
my point is he should have a way more

376
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,790
reliable car than this by now and a

377
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:01,310
still owns this scene the emotion the

378
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:03,230
acting the singing the vulnerability

379
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,850
this scene might have won the movie all

380
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:07,280
the tasker's once in renew when you find

381
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:11,090
out they said the next couple days this

382
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:12,620
question must have had Sebastian doubled

383
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,180
over in suspense considering he waited

384
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,170
until they traveled all the way the

385
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:17,150
Observatory to ask it after the audition

386
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:19,850
yeah you're about 20 minutes from the

387
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:21,140
end of the film and don't have time

388
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,250
enough for this question to be asked

389
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,050
this late also I'm pretty sure you

390
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:25,880
clearly broke up so I'm not sure why

391
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,530
you're asking for clarification like we

392
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:28,880
broke up then you helped me get an

393
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,890
audition so where do we stand now I was

394
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:33,440
in LA in January once it was 75 degrees

395
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,030
maybe the movie is making some kind of

396
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,470
statement with the Four Seasons motif

397
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:38,510
but la has been la no matter what season

398
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:40,370
I visit not yet Snow's there or

399
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:42,080
something okay maybe that's his point

400
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,120
but then what's this point I don't care

401
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,530
how famous you are this is some bull

402
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:47,600
parking there's plenty of room

403
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,670
driver still can't get between the lines

404
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:54,560
Chinese coffee right even if you saw her

405
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,240
walking up to the shop you still didn't

406
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,829
have time to prepare this order I go to

407
00:12:57,829 --> 00:12:59,569
Starbucks every goddamn day those people

408
00:12:59,569 --> 00:13:01,339
at my local shop are cooking lovely but

409
00:13:01,339 --> 00:13:02,600
even in their speediest they don't do

410
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,009
this book I don't care if she comes in

411
00:13:04,009 --> 00:13:05,720
here every day this is some mind-blowing

412
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,699
coffee preparedness the realization that

413
00:13:07,699 --> 00:13:08,839
she ended up with someone other than

414
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:11,180
setup is sad sure but it's overshadowed

415
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:13,160
by the feeling of when Tom Everett's got

416
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,360
been the last decade which is

417
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,829
distracting I wanted to give this movie

418
00:13:18,829 --> 00:13:20,660
props for showing a realistic love story

419
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,190
in which the main characters don't stay

420
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:23,750
together forever but the fact that both

421
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,279
of these assholes got exactly what they

422
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,019
wanted within five years is so

423
00:13:27,019 --> 00:13:28,430
unbelievable that I'm doubling down on

424
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:33,709
the signature this ginormous Emma Stone

425
00:13:33,709 --> 00:13:35,899
is famous billboard on the wall of the

426
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:37,759
jazz club is even more overt and obvious

427
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:39,259
than the wall of Mary Jane Watson acting

428
00:13:39,259 --> 00:13:40,790
posters in the background as Peter drags

429
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:42,319
his broken motorcycle in spider-man 2

430
00:13:42,319 --> 00:13:43,940
which is even more interesting given

431
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,410
Emma Stone's own time spent in the

432
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:48,829
spider-man universe the fact that famous

433
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:50,389
movie star Mia just happens to be in the

434
00:13:50,389 --> 00:13:52,100
location of Sebastian's new happening

435
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,110
jazz bar on its opening night is a

436
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:55,519
coincidence wrapped in synchronicity

437
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,110
covered in a thick layer of epilogue and

438
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:59,180
bull someone is staring at my wife like

439
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,980
this for this long I'm definitely asking

440
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,959
questions and here's where the movie

441
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,939
both treats and wins we get to see that

442
00:14:04,939 --> 00:14:06,560
fairy tale coupling of Mia instead play

443
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,300
out and it feels awesome even though we

444
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,920
know it's not real but then we also get

445
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,089
to see the reality ending where they

446
00:14:11,089 --> 00:14:12,620
both end up apart because sometimes

447
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,819
chasing your dream cost you

448
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:14,630
relationships

449
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,399
that's deep not only makes the what

450
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:17,600
could have been montage all the more

451
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,189
heartbreaking strangely enough the bar

452
00:14:19,189 --> 00:14:20,480
they go into in this version of the

453
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,940
story is called Tom efforts cops

okay fine you either die a hero or you

457
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,840
live long enough to see yourself become

458
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:55,790
the villain there are no two words in

459
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:59,480
the English language more harmful than

460
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,140
good job the sound that I get a little

461
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:09,410
bit nervous is best of all to hear
