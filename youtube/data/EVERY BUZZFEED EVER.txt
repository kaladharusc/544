1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:07,350
Wow your index finger's grown by half an inch

2
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:12,420
I just feel like my time would've been better spent working out my abs or something

3
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:17,340
I mean having one buff finger just seems useless. Well, we've already done the real exercises

4
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,199
So now we're just making them up as we go along

5
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:25,240
Right every buzzfeed ever

6
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:29,039
So today we're gonna try surgeries at two very different price points

7
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:38,829
I'm gonna have my appendix removed from this hospital for ninety thousand dollars while Delilah is gonna have hers removed wherever for only $1

8
00:00:38,829 --> 00:00:40,719
What?

9
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:46,149
Can we switch ? Nope. See you after surgery

10
00:00:46,149 --> 00:00:51,900
Hey sup guys, so as you can see my surgery went well, but since I only have

11
00:00:51,900 --> 00:01:04,960
$90,000, I can't stay all night to recover, and I have to take out the stitches on my own

12
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:12,460
I bought a butterknife for one dollar and I took out my... appendix

13
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:14,460
Hey, I think that's your liver

14
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,689
Do I need it?

15
00:01:16,689 --> 00:01:24,189
Mm-hmm. I know the expensive thing's gonna be better than the cheaper thing, but I just want to find out anyway

16
00:01:24,189 --> 00:01:27,939
All right guys here I go

17
00:01:27,939 --> 00:01:31,479
Eugene, are you okay?

18
00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:35,440
Well, my turn

19
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:40,580
I'm coming too, Ned. Whoa!

20
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:46,360
I'm the tall one! Whoo!

21
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,600
Thanks for watching.

22
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,560
We're the try guys!

23
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,789
Hey, what type of avocado are you? The weird bumpy one

24
00:01:57,789 --> 00:02:00,780
Well, we've never broken up before so I'm a little nervous

25
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,600
But I don't know, it could be fun breaking up for the first time. You know,

26
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:10,200
I mean I was hoping we'd get married soon. So I'm not really sure why we agreed to do this

27
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:16,229
Well, we wanted to try something new you seemed really excited to break up. Oh no, no, no

28
00:02:16,229 --> 00:02:18,760
No, it's it's it's just for the video

29
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:26,019
Oh! Oh the--Okay.S-Sorry. Yeah, so I guess it's over. Tight! See ya!

30
00:02:26,019 --> 00:02:32,019
Where'd he go? Um, I don't know I drove him here

31
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:39,549
Hey, um, so I just realized you drove me here and I need to get to another BuzzFeed video kissing hot strangers

32
00:02:39,549 --> 00:02:47,319
For the first time. Well, I can't believe nobody ever thought about race issues before BuzzFeed

33
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:52,900
Hey there! This is Buzzfeed Canada, and we're gonna be getting a $1 surgery today

34
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:57,960
Actually, you can keep the dollar. Oh, we'll ain't that a treat. Oh, don't mention it

35
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:05,020
Why is BuzzFeed telling my mom to be more sexually active?

36
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:08,920
Hey, watch out, watch out, watch out!

37
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,560
Pretty fun, right?

38
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,720
Who is the--?

39
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:26,240
How wo-would I--? Wait. What? You wanna try it? No, not at all. I'll try it

40
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:30,440
Every BuzzFeed Ever

41
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:34,160
Can I get a doctor?

42
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,480
Can I still drink?

43
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:40,370
Isn't there a Buzzfeed video I can sign up for about, like, stabbing your ex? Yeah, we've got a-- Yeah

44
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:47,300
21 people try murdering. Yeah. Oh my god, I'm-I'm so there. Sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Oh no, I'm sorry.

45
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:51,600
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Sorry. I'm sorrys.

46
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:58,780
Whoa! Ooh, that is a puff ass finger!

47
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,040
Oh, I'm good

48
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:06,640
Um, sidenote : Can somebody call the ambulance? Thanks. I think he has cramps

49
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:12,160
Oh, that makes sense

50
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,960
Thank you guys so much for watching

51
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:18,730
Can I just say that a BuzzFeed video is a lot like a football game where there's only like a couple minutes of actual interesting

52
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,900
content in there. Oh-hohoho! Oh, snap!

53
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,960
if you want to watch another BuzzFeed type video,

54
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,250
we compared a dollar taco versus a million dollar taco hit that box on the left

55
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:33,000
And if you're tired of the BuzzFeed format, you can click the box on the right to see every camping trip ever
