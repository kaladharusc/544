1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:23,150
jontron

2
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:39,739
I will wait a lifetime

3
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:42,260
my love for I know you will return to me

4
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,830
one day every last of the 3500 miles

5
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:47,629
from Southampton to the Big Apple feels

6
00:00:47,629 --> 00:00:49,820
like a dagger of infinity thrust between

7
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,790
our hearts my sweet darling we were to

8
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:54,470
be reunited once again this man and

9
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:56,720
bride we were to finally escape the

10
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,059
persecution of our family's name but as

11
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,680
fate would have it all our hopes and

12
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,360
dreams were swallowed whole with you

13
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,850
into the oceans of mists I could swear

14
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:06,470
it were all a lie and I could see your

15
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:08,689
ship there just on the horizon the rest

16
00:01:08,689 --> 00:01:10,580
have forgotten but that was so many

17
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,520
years ago now but I have not forsaken

18
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:19,340
you oh dear what's this Titanic the

19
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,549
legend goes on a full-length animated

20
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:24,049
feature based on the legend of the

21
00:01:24,049 --> 00:01:26,450
Titanic wait he's just a legend it's

22
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:27,470
just a silly old legend I thought was

23
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:28,730
like a real thing or a real boat with

24
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:30,440
with people on it that sink and they

25
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,010
died

26
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:33,170
I suppose that means my girlfriend is

27
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:35,360
not real then I guess there were some

28
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,490
signs along the way when we were at that

29
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:39,320
restaurant the waiter he said why did

30
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,610
you order two meals and not eat one of

31
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:41,780
them and he just left it there to get

32
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:42,170
cold

33
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,750
and I said curb your tongue that's my

34
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,909
lady and soon she will be departing on

35
00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:48,290
the great steam liner known as the

36
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:48,860
Titanic

37
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,630
that is definitely a real ship in the

38
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:55,460
real world and he said wait what she was

39
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,790
real to me today's topic of discussion

40
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:02,900
the animated children's film Titanic the

41
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,270
legend goes on yeah I don't even know

42
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:07,400
where to begin with this one this movie

43
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,259
was released in Italy in the year 2000

44
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:10,819
and for some reason it's based on the

45
00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:13,250
infamously tragic story of the RMS

46
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,950
Titanic of course why wouldn't it be

47
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:18,200
it's perfect material for a kid's film

48
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,849
think of all the funny slapstick

49
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:22,069
situations that could arise here first

50
00:02:22,069 --> 00:02:24,470
to Tennant now this I'm forced to talk

51
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:27,230
about the Titanic yet again what can I

52
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,700
say I guess a true story about a bunch

53
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,140
of people freezing to death really makes

54
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:32,389
for some good media this of course takes

55
00:02:32,389 --> 00:02:33,650
a close second of my other favorite

56
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:36,200
questionably topic youth feature beauty

57
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,360
the Trail of Tears or as it's known in

58
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,590
the American localized version

59
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,989
Pocahontas I don't really know what more

60
00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:43,640
to say about this i mean this film

61
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,590
provides a great deal more questions and

62
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,450
answers it's somewhat of a rite of

63
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:50,120
passage to see this for yourself so

64
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,930
without further ado let the paint begin

65
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:56,840
as you can see the man Nate the legend

66
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,519
responsible for this is a guy named

67
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:00,470
Camilo Teddy I'm sure to go down in

68
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:04,150
history as one of el italiano primo hey

69
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:07,489
what's with these names human McGann

70
00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:09,170
okay I guess that's just a foreign name

71
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:12,319
but Scarl poor bastard

72
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,910
his name was so beautiful before the

73
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:21,020
accident so much potential

74
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:24,030
mm-hmm would you look at that they got

75
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:26,190
to the point real fast on that one huh

76
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:28,410
they sake that son of a bitch right away

77
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,630
so throughout this bizarre first scene

78
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,370
we're shown a diverse cast of characters

79
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:33,630
that I can only assume are from the

80
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,640
events preceding this one you know like

81
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,980
before the ship sinks I guess they were

82
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:38,880
just trying to do a little something

83
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,410
special here little memento meets

84
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:42,960
Titanic really bold filmmaking what

85
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,000
sorrow I feel for these characters so

86
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,350
close to my own heart

87
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:49,710
red-haired lady brown haired guy old

88
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:52,710
woman 1 &amp; 2 currently drowning human and

89
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:55,910
of course 101 Dalmatians

90
00:03:55,910 --> 00:04:00,120
honey well what now Pongo say you hey I

91
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,350
saved more people when you could save

92
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:02,820
two dogs will live for a collective

93
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,380
three years after the end of this film

94
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:06,240
I guess Disney royalty will get you far

95
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:15,880
in this life

96
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,530
whoops what are you two laughing at what

97
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:20,989
changed here I'm glad this man's violent

98
00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:22,430
death brought you momentary join

99
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,930
distraction from the sinking of your

100
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,150
ship maybe they were just enjoying his

101
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:30,290
perfect 10 year so weird they just keep

102
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:32,450
looping the same shots over and over and

103
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:33,530
showing things that don't even look like

104
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:37,969
they pertain to the moment at hand

105
00:04:37,969 --> 00:04:41,360
oh and it's over the movie now decides

106
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,959
to start for real hope everyone's ready

107
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:47,629
for some laughs for some fun let's go on

108
00:04:47,629 --> 00:04:49,699
this animated adventure together maybe

109
00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:51,079
by the end of it we'll be laughing like

110
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:53,089
two old ladies on the verge of death on

111
00:04:53,089 --> 00:04:56,539
a lifeboat huh could happen how can

112
00:04:56,539 --> 00:04:58,549
anyone be expected to try to enjoy this

113
00:04:58,549 --> 00:05:01,429
movie after being given that intro going

114
00:05:01,429 --> 00:05:03,049
into this movie everyone already knows

115
00:05:03,049 --> 00:05:04,579
how it's gonna end but then they just

116
00:05:04,579 --> 00:05:07,519
reminded us in painstaking detail you

117
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:08,899
want to now have to anticipate all these

118
00:05:08,899 --> 00:05:10,279
characters dying I'm supposed to get

119
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:12,289
invested in them emotionally camilo you

120
00:05:12,289 --> 00:05:13,669
just gave me up the fucking final

121
00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:15,289
destination vision of all my friends

122
00:05:15,289 --> 00:05:18,409
deaths you blue nitaac so the story

123
00:05:18,409 --> 00:05:20,449
begins for real this time with the girl

124
00:05:20,449 --> 00:05:22,159
we saw in the previous scene on a train

125
00:05:22,159 --> 00:05:24,709
opening a locket which seems to have a

126
00:05:24,709 --> 00:05:29,389
picture of herself inside it I'll never

127
00:05:29,389 --> 00:05:35,239
forget you me moping over that picture

128
00:05:35,239 --> 00:05:40,119
you're never going to find the precious

129
00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:42,949
yeah and for all intents and purposes I

130
00:05:42,949 --> 00:05:44,689
hope that bitch is dead serves you right

131
00:05:44,689 --> 00:05:46,519
for sitting quietly on a train you're

132
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:49,279
wrong I will find her and my father too

133
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:52,009
I'll find them both well I guess that's

134
00:05:52,009 --> 00:05:52,429
that

135
00:05:52,429 --> 00:05:54,709
that came together very well here we

136
00:05:54,709 --> 00:05:56,149
have the obligatory scene where all the

137
00:05:56,149 --> 00:05:57,559
characters and introducers are boarding

138
00:05:57,559 --> 00:05:59,389
the ship although only about 1/3 of them

139
00:05:59,389 --> 00:06:00,649
seem to have any semblance of

140
00:06:00,649 --> 00:06:02,689
originality if you could call any of

141
00:06:02,689 --> 00:06:08,119
this original why are there

142
00:06:08,119 --> 00:06:09,709
anthropomorphic animals boarding the

143
00:06:09,709 --> 00:06:11,989
ship and not to mention every last one

144
00:06:11,989 --> 00:06:13,909
of them is based on some Disney or Don

145
00:06:13,909 --> 00:06:15,860
Bluth character no in fact just about

146
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,539
every character in this film is ripped

147
00:06:17,539 --> 00:06:18,559
off from something else

148
00:06:18,559 --> 00:06:20,209
you've got granny from Looney Tunes you

149
00:06:20,209 --> 00:06:21,649
got a Cinderella thing going on here

150
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:23,059
with the main character there's the

151
00:06:23,059 --> 00:06:25,249
Dalmatians as previously discussed the

152
00:06:25,249 --> 00:06:26,929
mice from americantale the crow from

153
00:06:26,929 --> 00:06:28,849
secretin in Cheshire cat from Alice in

154
00:06:28,849 --> 00:06:30,259
Wonderland Belle from Beauty and the

155
00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:31,669
Beast and the geese straight out of the

156
00:06:31,669 --> 00:06:33,679
Aristocats and it goes on from there I

157
00:06:33,679 --> 00:06:35,419
just really don't understand where they

158
00:06:35,419 --> 00:06:36,349
could have been coming from when they

159
00:06:36,349 --> 00:06:38,329
were making this ripping off a bunch of

160
00:06:38,329 --> 00:06:41,089
classic cartoon characters and putting

161
00:06:41,089 --> 00:06:44,269
them on the Titanic Camilla you trying

162
00:06:44,269 --> 00:06:45,289
to make some sort of sick twisted

163
00:06:45,289 --> 00:06:46,339
reality show

164
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:47,689
Camilla what are you doing how would he

165
00:06:47,689 --> 00:06:48,969
go to us what are you doing

166
00:06:48,969 --> 00:06:52,209
so Oh No

167
00:06:52,209 --> 00:06:53,849
Angelica here dropped her things Oh

168
00:06:53,849 --> 00:06:57,399
Angelica you really are what a nice man

169
00:06:57,399 --> 00:07:00,159
picking it up for you you are let's hope

170
00:07:00,159 --> 00:07:04,899
it's a smooth crossing excuse me the

171
00:07:04,899 --> 00:07:06,789
fuck did you just say do you know

172
00:07:06,789 --> 00:07:08,499
something we don't you got something to

173
00:07:08,499 --> 00:07:11,619
say why so devious wait a second I

174
00:07:11,619 --> 00:07:13,360
recognize that voice

175
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,360
you're not really an old man I knew it

176
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,969
he was the iceberg all along I suppose

177
00:07:18,969 --> 00:07:20,529
it's easy pickings at this point but

178
00:07:20,529 --> 00:07:22,869
what's with the jerky animation half the

179
00:07:22,869 --> 00:07:24,039
time it doesn't even seem like the

180
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:25,269
animators knew what they wanted from

181
00:07:25,269 --> 00:07:25,899
each shot

182
00:07:25,899 --> 00:07:27,849
it's as if two directors constantly

183
00:07:27,849 --> 00:07:29,409
battled about what emotion the character

184
00:07:29,409 --> 00:07:30,909
in question should be displaying at any

185
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:32,379
given moment not to mention the

186
00:07:32,379 --> 00:07:36,489
downright abruptly time dialogue this is

187
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:39,669
oh thanks well I must've dropped this I

188
00:07:39,669 --> 00:07:43,839
really owe you one is that all you have

189
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:46,059
to say Italian Mouse I suppose you're

190
00:07:46,059 --> 00:07:48,339
gonna forget about AI oh and you it's

191
00:07:48,339 --> 00:07:50,139
near impossible to follow what's going

192
00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:51,519
on in this movie I'm not even

193
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:52,869
exaggerating there are so many

194
00:07:52,869 --> 00:07:54,969
characters doing so many things in such

195
00:07:54,969 --> 00:07:56,349
a short span of time

196
00:07:56,349 --> 00:07:58,419
I even found myself mixing the

197
00:07:58,419 --> 00:08:00,279
characters up for real the first time I

198
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:01,839
watched this I legitimately didn't know

199
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:03,369
these two old ladies were different

200
00:08:03,369 --> 00:08:05,199
characters they're different characters

201
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,239
there's just two evil stepmothers in

202
00:08:07,239 --> 00:08:12,520
this hey more evils better right

203
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:18,039
oh okay so let me get this straight to

204
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,419
crow he stole the pin out of the

205
00:08:19,419 --> 00:08:21,430
squirrels hat there squirrel notice turn

206
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:21,970
around

207
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:24,669
well then he left and the significance

208
00:08:24,669 --> 00:08:32,169
of that was what's with the calcium's

209
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:34,409
guys we've been on tourists and yard

210
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:36,880
wait til they're home and we'll charge

211
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:42,760
us to join you

212
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:48,700
I play wicked bongos you know hey listen

213
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,380
I'm sorry I didn't mean to make you guys

214
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,000
uncomfortable I'll turn the movie off

215
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,339
now if it helps and you don't mind me

216
00:08:54,339 --> 00:08:55,149
I'll be over here in the corner

217
00:08:55,149 --> 00:08:56,380
celebrating the death of my own

218
00:08:56,380 --> 00:09:02,860
innocence I can still hear the screams

219
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,950
papa

220
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:08,050
the van the clown cop of mine hey guy I

221
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:09,490
don't think the captain can hear you

222
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:10,660
what you're saying is interesting at all

223
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,610
but at this moment I think his brain is

224
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:20,910
internally swelling and away she goes

225
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:23,350
beginning the most magical of Legends

226
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:25,390
that definitely never happened at all I

227
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,430
swear in the next scene were met with

228
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:29,050
the two evil stepsisters seemingly

229
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:39,240
deciding what to wear

230
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,010
did I stroke out did they stroke out

231
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:45,100
someone has stroking out I didn't do

232
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,660
anything to alter that that's how the

233
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,640
movie comes packaged that's how it's

234
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:56,649
meant to be it's art so from what I can

235
00:09:56,649 --> 00:09:58,750
gather here the main storyline is that

236
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,880
Angelica here loses her prized locket

237
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,209
and a search for it begins sort of

238
00:10:06,209 --> 00:10:08,589
broken china joints what can a

239
00:10:08,589 --> 00:10:11,410
sociopathic person wrote this movie who

240
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:15,320
can even get into such a headspace

241
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,240
throughout the movie Angelica's seen

242
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,589
being nice to the animals around the

243
00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:20,690
house especially the one little mouse so

244
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:22,339
the animals like her and elect to help

245
00:10:22,339 --> 00:10:26,930

246

music it won't be invented for some 70

258

for you to go tying the legs of

272
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,970

273

00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:18,560

281
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,680
at long last our star-crossed lovers

282
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,870
meet and she instantly makes a pose as

283
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,130
if she were trying to imitate what she

284
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:42,110
saw someone doing the cover of Vogue I

285
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:43,670
don't think she realizes what she looks

286
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,080
like there I think in her head it's

287

imagination I'm pretty sure that's a

292
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,100
big-ass pair of granny panties I don't

293
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,330
know that you really do want to see her

294
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:02,330

295
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:06,060

Wow he's going in for the touchdown and

297
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:13,050
then she just walks away that typical

298
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:14,490
you know she doesn't even want to be

299
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:16,680
viciously molested talk about playing

300
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:20,070
hard to get and just like that the next

301
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:22,740
scene starts up with a new Mouse I don't

302
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,720
remember this guy he is holding an

303
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,610
adorable tiny candle though I mean come

304
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:28,230

305
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:30,240
candle did he get that thing custom-made

306
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,580
eat up while you can boys you'll need

307
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,970
your strength for the Mexican winter I

308
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:37,260
really have no idea who this mouse could

309
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,180
be or why we're watching this so let's

310
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,290
just move on it pretend it didn't happen

311
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:42,270
I think I must be going a bit soft in

312
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:42,600
the head

313
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,340

317
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,860
making one but I don't want to rush

318
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,140

340
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,800
get unstuck from being in five frames

341
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,900
per second so after this encounter

342
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,850
Angelica goes back to granny's room and

343
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:04,620
explains how sad she is that she can't

344
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,850
go to the reception with the guy she

345
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:07,589
just met because she has nothing to wear

346
00:15:07,589 --> 00:15:09,870
upon hearing this granny offers Angelica

347
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,310
her old dress from her youth which she

348
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,290
for some reason has with her on the ship

349
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:17,310
I haven't since my board Frances took me

350
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:19,860
to the Opera for the first and last time

351
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,410
Oh granny how heartwarming wait first

352
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:23,300
and last

353
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,680
granny something you want to talk about

354
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,710
his uncle Francis is he all right

355
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:30,870
also I don't want to know what happened

356
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:33,089
in around or near that dress if granny

357
00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:35,040
was so fond to that night yeah I

358
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,450
wouldn't do that Angelica so my uncle

359
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:37,830
Francis might still be on there if you

360
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:39,330
know what I'm saying just make sure this

361
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:40,890

and Hortense I wouldn't worry about them

364
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,990
yeah mainly because I think no one knows

365
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,430
who they are or if they're even in this

366

the locket but that's all they took

389

thank you thank you I'm sorry I'm just a

394
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:14,360
little embarrassed that my sneezes I

395
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,470
think they make me look like a little

396
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:19,770
scared boy

397
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:23,050
Wow it's beautiful the song that plays

398
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:25,060
about them is already in total longer

399
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,080
than the amount of time they've actually

400
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:33,130
spent in each other's presence I'm not

401
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:34,420
sure what's going on here but the guy in

402
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,920
the black hair is taking some sort of

403
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,750
issue with Angelica and then he comes up

404
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,190
and straight up points to her tits for

405
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:41,170
like 10 seconds realistically I think he

406
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:42,220
was just trying to save her from the

407
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:50,620
clutches of Jack the charming it was

408
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:57,010
that girl what was that perhaps the

409
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:59,080
locket is back with its rightful owner

410
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,700
what does he mean by that

411
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:07,150
yeah what does he mean by that no you

412
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:09,970
know nothing about me nothing what do

413
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:11,680
you mean I know oh wait no you're right

414
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,570
I do know absolutely zero about you

415
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:15,160
besides your name if I don't even think

416
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:15,790
I know your name

417
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:16,990
you didn't tell me you just walked away

418
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:18,310
maybe we should just call this whole

419
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:19,690
thing off or at least think it through

420
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:22,870
nothing you could tell me could prevent

421
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:25,180
me from loving you even if I were to say

422
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,760
something like I reject all your sexual

423
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,790
advances oh yeah okay no I can now see

424
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,050
that that is not going to stop you

425
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:33,490
either what's going on here how'd

426
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:35,050
everyone get to a vantage point to watch

427
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:36,970
this all at once nobody noticed they're

428
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:38,800
being watched here and they lived

429
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,770
happily ever after as skeletons at the

430
00:18:41,770 --> 00:19:00,700
bottom of the ocean hey everything went

431
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,740
perfectly to plan what a perfect scene

432
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:05,230
am i right ten out of ten okay I think

433
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:06,460
we're done with the worst of it love

434
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,260
interest kissed everything's falling

435
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:08,890
into place

436
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:10,360
the movies got to wrap up at some point

437
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:20,290
now come on come on baby this one out at

438
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:21,610
least it makes more sense than hip hop

439
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:26,500
dog in terms of time period Oh No well

440
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,570
this is getting sinister I've got a bad

441
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:32,470
feeling about this never seen this

442
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:36,390
before that's not just ice

443
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:39,750
let me just get him focus here you got a

444
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,510

carnist number

447
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,470
so finally the iceberg hits general

448
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:54,120
mayhem ensues and all the character is

449
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,680
scrambled to reach the boats exit

450
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,450
yeah buddy save that energy don't want

451
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:05,330
to expend it before you get rowing

452
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:14,009
yay what what horror eyewitness that day

453
00:20:14,009 --> 00:20:17,519
surely I will never forget it as long as

454
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:26,159
I live wow I can't believe it

455
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,169
this movie is finally drawing to a close

456
00:20:28,169 --> 00:20:30,240
so William the love interest breaks a

457
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,590
window with a wicker chair somehow it

458
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:32,480
escapes the ship

459
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,919
all the while Angelica seems unaffected

460
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:38,009
by his suspected untimely death do you

461
00:20:38,009 --> 00:20:42,080
still have a picture in a locket yes

462
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,759
ever since my mother puts it around my

463
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:47,490
neck as a baby and then laughter because

464
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:53,909
she was forced to no please no oh yes

465
00:20:53,909 --> 00:20:56,940
all along this woman was Angelica's

466
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:57,419
mother

467
00:20:57,419 --> 00:20:59,700
hooray she's been found oh but her dad

468
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,429
she said she'd find my father too I'll

469
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:05,009
find them both now he's dead still or

470
00:21:05,009 --> 00:21:07,409
missing or worse dead and missing but at

471
00:21:07,409 --> 00:21:09,980
least she found her mom look over there

472
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:12,629
it looks like someone in the water oh my

473
00:21:12,629 --> 00:21:22,309
god there he is just the nick of time

474
00:21:22,309 --> 00:21:24,840
false alarm it's not William throw him

475
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,120
back are you serious it's the detective

476
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,559
with the red hair and mismatched beard

477
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,600
from earlier so the literal only reason

478
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,070
for that character exisiting was for

479
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:34,169
this one gag at the end of the film the

480
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:35,070
bait and switch

481
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,539
I bet the writers really patted

482
00:21:36,539 --> 00:21:40,409
themselves on the back for this one but

483
00:21:40,409 --> 00:21:42,480
then an a joyous twist of fate William

484
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,590
is recovered

485
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:49,470
please will you where's William what do

486
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:50,879
you have the brain of a baby

487
00:21:50,879 --> 00:21:52,799
you don't got object permanence yet the

488
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,539
moment he's out of sight he's just he's

489
00:21:54,539 --> 00:22:02,149
gone from your reality please what okay

490
00:22:02,149 --> 00:22:04,110
no never mind

491
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:07,240
close them throw me back

492
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,029
and on that day they lived happily ever

493
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:11,710
after but just then it was honestly
