1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,640
Alright guys, let's do this.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,880
Remember we have a better chance of winning if we stick together.

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,360
Yeah teamwork makes the dream work, baby

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,760
(broken and echo-ey) Hey guys, what's up!

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,460
Dude, kid, turn that music down

6
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,040
What?

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,040
Your music's too loud!

8
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,980
What? What are you talking about, guys?

9
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:19,860
Stop screaming into the mic

10
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:21,160
What?

11
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:26,060
Just kick him

12
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,060
Honey did they kick you out again?

13
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:30,060
(still broken and echo-ey) Yeah mom.

14
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,600
No one wants to be my friend, I don't know why!

15
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,540
Did you try playing heavy metal music in the background like I suggested?

16
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,980
Yes.

17
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:43,840
Every. Gamer. Ever.

18
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,280
Babe, dinner's ready!

19
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,280
Can't right now babe, I finally met a player who is my total equal

20
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,180
His competence, dexterity and skill are rivalled only by my own

21
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,700
And after 28 years of gameplay,

22
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:02,240
I could finally say I found my perfect nemesis and his name

23
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,340
Is darkrider57

24
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,660
Well played, darkrider

25
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:11,140
Well played.

26
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,460
Honey, dinner's ready!

27
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:19,380
Can't right now, mom. I'm kicking the shit out of some shitty old shit guy.

28
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:23,570
Does anyone still play snake?

29
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:24,600
Ugh, Jesus Christ.

30
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,540
All these triple-a titles are so mindless and repetitive.

31
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:31,160
Can anyone make anything original anymore?

32
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:35,220
Well, back to Candy Crush I guess.

33
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,280
Made a match.

34
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,680
Made a match.

35
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,520
Oh nice, three in a row. That's a match.

36
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:48,300
Nice.

37
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,020
Made a match.

38
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,860
Fallout's better than Elder Scrolls!

39
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:54,280
You take that back!

40
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,020
Yo, you wanna play some Smash Bros ?

41
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,680
Uh, not really because you always rage quit.

42
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,660
I won't this time.

43
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,260
You won't?

44
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,380
I will not rage quit.

45
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,180
Do you promise?

46
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,240
I promise.

47
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,420
Do you promise though?

48
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,520
I promise though.

49
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,520
But do you promise?

50
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,560
I promise!

51
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,100
Solemnly swear?

52
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:11,060
I promise to solemnly swear.

53
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:15,780
Okay.

54
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,640
THIS GAME SUCKS! It's stupid!

55
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,780
It's broken! Controller doesn't work!

56
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:24,500
It's dumb!

57
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,280
Super dumb!

58
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,860
Hey guys, I'm gonna be streaming in about 15.

59
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:33,900
From the maker of last year's best reviewed indie game, Blank White Screen,

60
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,160
comes his new game, Immovable Dot.

61
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,400
Are there any other graphics?

62
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,160
Just the dot.

63
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,100
What does it do?

64
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:40,860
Nothing.

65
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,100
How do you win?

66
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,100
You can't.

67
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,000
When's it over?

68
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,380
Never.

69
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,580
What does it mean?

70
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,560
Everything and nothing.

71
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,940
*Smashes Screen*

72
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,040
11 out of 10 stars!

73
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,380
Master piece!
-Game of the Year!

74
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:03,060
Never forget Dreamcast.

75
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,220
Son, you need to put down those video games

76
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:08,640
and focus on your homework or you're gonna become a homeless bum!

77
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,100
Okay. Well, I just won a major eSports tournament I get paid

78
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:21,130
$200,000 a month streaming. I get laid every 28 hours on the dot and I just bought this house so you have to move out

79
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:22,000
Bye-bye

80
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,380
Wow

81
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:26,704
Guess I learned a valuable lesson about parenting children in 2018.

82
00:03:26,704 --> 00:03:30,160
Dad. I'm dropping out of high school to become a fashion blogger

83
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:35,070
Well, apparently I don't understand anything about this world anymore. So I say go for it.

84
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:35,767
Thanks, I will

85
00:03:35,767 --> 00:03:37,810
I'm gonna go live in a box now

86
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:38,950
Okay

87
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:43,100
So I know this is Limited Too, but vintage.

88
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:54,319
Ah, the disc is scratched. Haha. Just kidding I downloaded it

89
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,879
I did it

90
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:57,019
finally after

91
00:03:57,019 --> 00:03:58,239
2,000 hours of gameplay

92
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:04,849
I perfectly completed Skyrim. Every main quest, every side quest, collected every potion, weapon, and armor.

93
00:04:04,849 --> 00:04:10,300
Maxed out every skill and level, became the leader of every guild, smash herd every dragon shout and spell.

94
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,389
And

95
00:04:11,389 --> 00:04:17,600
Decorated my home with every piece of pottery and silverware from the realm.

96
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:24,770
And now I feel empty again

97
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:26,700
Time to start over.

98
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,000
Every. Gamer. Ever.

99
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,800
*Beep Beep*

100
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,000
Made a match.

101
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,600
Made a match.

102
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,100
*Beep Beep*

103
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,060
You sure?
-I'm sure.

104
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,340
(Slurred) Are you sure?
-I'm sure

105
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,400
(Even more slurred)Are you sure?
-I'm super sure

106
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,860
(Overlapping and slurred)
Are you sure?
-I'm sup- I'm super sure

107
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,600
(Normal) Okay
-Great

108
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,229
-I'm on the phone with my mom!-

109
00:04:46,229 --> 00:04:46,729
Okay!

110
00:04:46,729 --> 00:04:50,400
-Mom, mom! I want Del Taco-

111
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,400
-Gimme Del Taco-

112
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:59,360
This game! It sucks. And you always plays Fox and that's not fair cuz nobody can beat Fox

113
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,550
Nobody can beat Fox!

114
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:08,630
Not even if I play as Marth and I use the move, the move over and over again. It doesn't work!

115
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:10,389
(Ian)Thank you guys so much for watching this video

116
00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:15,500
and if you want to watch more, guess what there's two videos on the screen right now that you can click.

117
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:21,310
The one on the left is 1998 verse 2018 
-(Courtney) Ya then another good one is Video Game Items in Real Life 3

118
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:25,570
It's on the right. Click that box on the right or the left
-(Ian) or the left, whichever one yous feel

119
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:27,400
(Slurring &quot;Which ever one one you want&quot;)

120
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,539
The internet's free gain

121
00:05:29,539 --> 00:05:31,000
It's free
