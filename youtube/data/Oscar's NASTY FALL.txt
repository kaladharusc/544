you do something incredible here officer

77
00:05:14,669 --> 00:05:24,930
Yatta Yatta Roscoe you got it faster you

78
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:43,930
just need to go faster okay you almost

79
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:57,010
have an old school move there's an old

80
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:58,780
school skateboarding move that you can

81
00:05:58,780 --> 00:05:59,919
do even if you're not a good

82
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,930
skateboarder if you just kind of jump

83
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:04,570
and if there's like a hanging piece of

84
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:07,510
chain or one of these you jump over the

85
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,729
thing and you land back on your board

86
00:06:08,729 --> 00:06:11,710
and I said oh great I can this is a rare

87
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:14,470
opportunity to try that move and then I

88
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:16,030
looked at it was a little higher than I

89
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:33,160
thought I mean it's too high to jump you

90
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:38,169
can do it I can get a skateboard so this

91
00:06:38,169 --> 00:06:40,389
is just a break in between film

92
00:06:40,389 --> 00:06:42,039
screenings in the fear of that we've

93
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:43,690
been exploring this campus

94
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:46,120
it's a veteran's home the largest

95
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,700
veterans home in the United States so

96
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:52,270
one of the veterans told me an Oscar and

97
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:53,950
I have been skating around and we've

98
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,900
like been meeting veterans and I met a

99
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,060
really nice guy who was super super

100
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:00,250
psyched about my drone told me a story

101
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,300
about flying a drone in

102
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,889

how my father grew up in a military

107
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,759
background and then I think he was like

108
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:14,710
oh wait this guy's a hardcore military

109
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:16,389

110
00:07:16,389 --> 00:07:18,879
fought even though he served so there

111
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:19,990
