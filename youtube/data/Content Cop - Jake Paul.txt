of having his name in the title or

39
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:17,120
facing the thumbnail now that all of

40
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,620
that is out of the way we're going to

41
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,600
react to a video that this hype beasts

42
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,970
released about a year ago essentially

43
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:25,160
begging for a Content comp I don't

44
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,319
really care at all but I kinda really

45
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:29,000
want him to make one on me I really

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,980
don't care but I kinda really want him

47
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,480
to make one on me these are quite

48
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,370
obviously conflicting statements because

49
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:36,230
you have no idea what strategy to

50
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:37,940
actually go with should I be super

51
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:40,580
confident and act as if I want a Content

52
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,380
cop or should I act as if I don't care

53
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,180
at all I don't know let's try both

54
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,400
pillar rows my appearance whatever go

55
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,110
pot bring up some old pictures of me

56
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:50,150
from way back then when I looked weird

57
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,340
what are you talking about it's like you

58
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,140
watched the leafy video and thought this

59
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,760
is all this guy does is roasts people's

60
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,530
appearance I could stave off all

61
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:59,330
criticism by showing pictures of myself

62
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:01,640
when I was a goofball kid I'd like you

63
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,440
when your goofball kid that's perfectly

64
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,000
fine those pictures are great you should

65
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,950
show the clip of you saying the rape

66
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:10,350
comments is what you should be doing why

67
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:11,520
he raped you

68
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,800
nah but did it feel good how long did

69
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,120
the rape last before

70
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,460
I meant your list okay so it's not that

71
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,320
bad did you still haven't shit or no

72
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,450
guys if you want to rape her she won't

73
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:24,060
see you so if you were to make one on me

74
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,800
what would you say it seems like he

75
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,780
wants to move past the rape comments and

76
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,370
I don't blame him I would want to move

77
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,110
past those as well but I'm not gonna let

78
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,790
him off the hook that easy because it

79
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:34,770
seems like he has this disregard for

80
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:36,810
what he can be criticized for what would

81
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,430
you say and I just want to spell it out

82
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,860
hey dumbass you did something stupid in

83
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,290
the past you can be criticized for it if

84
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,600

just hours ago I've already spoken to

108
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,030
the police and all they could tell us

109
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:08,250
was that the murder might have something

110
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,800
to do with the organization or cult

111
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,260
known as the hyper beast this is a

112

it's sort of the ends justify the means

144
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,220
because by the end of the stream they're

145

giddy with excitement cuz they got all

146

166
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:21,940
ago that's called Netflix and chill it's

167
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:24,010
a story time video no I show her where

168
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:26,440
my bathroom is she goes and for some

169
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,660
reason she leaves her phone on the couch

170
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:31,120
right so I'm on some Curious George you

171
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,590
know I want to go to her phone so I'm

172
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:33,970
going through her phone right now and

173
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:35,470
I'm looking through her messages and

174
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:37,480
tell me why she texts like 10 other

175
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,250
dudes are you awake I don't even feel

176
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,530
special anymore and I feel like I'm just

177
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:43,600
another option to her oh he doesn't feel

178
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,330
special anymore you hear that ladies I

179
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:48,310
wonder what he's gonna do now that he

180
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,180
doesn't feel

181
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:51,160
special and I feel like I'm just another

182
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,960
option to her so I'm like you know what

183
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,880
I'm about to get some payback and just

184
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,410
put her ass on the Internet

185
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:58,750
payback for what again because you

186
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,669
weren't there first choice to sleep with

187
00:08:00,669 --> 00:08:03,220
so I set up the hidden camera man I sit

188
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,770
back - and out of nowhere again he

189
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:08,020
starts calling me or whoever it just

190
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,479
starts calling my phone and she finds

191
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,669
the hidden camera so I see you made it

192
00:08:12,669 --> 00:08:14,440
to the end of the video man based on a

193
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,990
true story if it is a parody of story

194
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:19,090
time videos and you're admitting to

195
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:22,120
almost committing a crime by recording

196
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,560
someone without their knowledge of you

197
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,930
having sex with them you'd think you'd

198
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:27,820
at least be intelligent enough to say

199
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:31,030
guys this was a joke this was a parody

200
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:32,500
put her ass on the Internet

201
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:37,029
put her ass you should plaster parody

202
00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:38,560
all over it you shouldn't say at the end

203
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,110
of it based on a true story I completely

204
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:42,969
understand why you delete that video it

205
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:45,220
sort of ruins all future prospects of

206
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,690
you having sexual intercourse with

207
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:48,520
anyone at the end of the day it's just

208
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,930
another example of you being stupid

209
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,430
despite you saying

210
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:52,959
what what do you say who'd be like all

211
00:08:52,959 --> 00:09:00,000
right don't bullies people Yahoo

212
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,550
for this next segment I'm going to

213
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,410
remove myself as a critic and instead

214
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,689
I'm going to speak as a fan because me

215
00:09:06,689 --> 00:09:09,149
and all the other fans want to know what

216
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:11,100
happened to the clickbait challenge

217
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,629
winner at last but not least make sure

218
00:09:12,629 --> 00:09:14,430
to put hashtag clickbait challenge in

219
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:15,870
the description because at the end of

220
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,759
two weeks the video with the most views

221
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:20,819
you win a humungous prize so go out get

222
00:09:20,819 --> 00:09:22,709
creative and let's get click baiting

223
00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:24,089
yeah but we're still waiting for the

224
00:09:24,089 --> 00:09:24,449
winner

225
00:09:24,449 --> 00:09:26,670
you didn't announce it not on YouTube

226
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:29,879
not on Twitter not on Facebook not on

227
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:33,180
Instagram not even on Google+ you don't

228
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,500
have to divulge any private information

229
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,839
it was a public competition where

230
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:38,790
there's a public winner the the person

231
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,920
who got the most views within those two

232
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,019
weeks who used hashtag clickbait

233
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:45,329
challenge there is one thing that you

234
00:09:45,329 --> 00:09:46,829
really shouldn't say and that's

235
00:09:46,829 --> 00:09:48,899
something along the lines of I'm not

236
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:51,209
going to announce the winner because I

237
00:09:51,209 --> 00:09:52,829
respect their privacy

238
00:09:52,829 --> 00:09:59,870
I'm not live right now right no no no I

239
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,620
don't think there's anything inherently

240
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:04,529
wrong with having expensive tastes the

241
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:06,329
problem arises when you're obnoxious

242
00:10:06,329 --> 00:10:16,769
about it how much do you think this

243
00:10:16,769 --> 00:10:24,420
jacket was worth 16 positivity positive

244
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:28,950
people

245
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:31,720
clearly we can all privately laugh about

246
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,030
making it rain on homeless people like

247
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:35,530
you and your friend that yeah we're

248
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:37,000
fucked up I can't believe we did that

249
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,770
but I don't think most people would

250
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:40,690
upload it because they'd realize that

251
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:42,430
any comedic value is completely

252
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:44,410
overshadowed by how much of a faggot you

253
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,060
appear to be this seems like an

254
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,560
appropriate time to show you this great

255
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,630
opinion not osteophyte like one of the

256
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:51,310
few youtubers that used the money I made

257
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:53,290
from YouTube to like buy stuff to make

258
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:55,630
my videos better he will often flex in

259
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:58,000
his music videos most ponies I need blew

260
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,750
on my bills

261
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,880
looking like the 50 best I'm gonna flex

262
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,860
so my wrists I put some ice he will also

263
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,660
flex on random people in the street

264
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,850
there's a store called supreme and they

265
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:08,530
drop this today and there's like this

266
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:10,930
really long line like three mildly so

267
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:15,340
I'm about to walk by I see the reaction

268
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:18,310
he tries very hard to convince his fans

269
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:23,170
that he is not flexing on them never

270
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:25,210
once again I would never reflects on my

271
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:30,790
fans just be flexing on the haters well

272
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,260
there comes a point where you have to

273
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,540
realize did your fans watch your videos

274
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,370
more than your haters watch your videos

275
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:39,100
so you are flexing on your fans one of

276
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,230
the only decent points he's ever made is

277
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:43,570
in this video where he compares his life

278
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,820
to the life of the rich kids of snapchat

279
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,800
and there were a lot of similarities go

280
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:53,130
figure but by the end of it he says

281
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:55,630
there's someone out there that will

282
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:57,400
master personal pressure so go watch

283
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,230
someone else I think that's a perfectly

284
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,220
fair statement

285
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,720
but you shouldn't preface it by saying

286
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,030
guys I'm not showing off on rich these

287
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,710
are just things that I do on an everyday

288
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:07,810
basis you absolutely are showing off

289
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,670
just fucking own it if you're showing

290
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,860
off you're showing off also he does this

291
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,960
horrible skit where he pretends to have

292
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:19,410
a normal life

293
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:22,540
best soon as the camera turns off I just

294
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:25,020
have a normal life

295
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,649
[Music]

296
00:12:27,649 --> 00:12:34,279
I don't have much of a problem with it

297
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:36,139
being an inaccurate portrayal of a

298
00:12:36,139 --> 00:12:38,149
normal person's life but it's just

299
00:12:38,149 --> 00:12:39,230
fucking lazy

300
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:41,509
heaven forbid you filmed this outside or

301
00:12:41,509 --> 00:12:43,759
at a friend's house or anywhere that

302
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:46,610
isn't a multi-million dollar mansion so

303
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:48,559
that the skit actually makes sense

304
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:51,110
he is extremely insecure and he makes it

305
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:53,179
very obvious when he uploads videos like

306
00:12:53,179 --> 00:12:55,970
this where he details how much money he

307
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:57,679
earns in a month on YouTube there's like

308
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:59,089
this video that has been going crazy

309
00:12:59,089 --> 00:13:01,189
viral and basically in divinity shows

310
00:13:01,189 --> 00:13:03,410
how much money YouTube has paid him

311
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:05,389
everyone just giving them so much props

312
00:13:05,389 --> 00:13:06,889
like everyone loves if these dude is

313
00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:08,689
getting so much street cred and I'm like

314
00:13:08,689 --> 00:13:11,600
I want some street cred too last month I

315
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,589
made a roughly $60,000 I mean it's okay

316
00:13:15,589 --> 00:13:17,569
it is actually my lowest paid month once

317
00:13:17,569 --> 00:13:19,189
again I only got 20 million views I'm

318
00:13:19,189 --> 00:13:20,779
not sure what odds he's trying to

319
00:13:20,779 --> 00:13:23,269
improve the odds that a female will

320
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:25,129
finally see him as a suitable sex

321
00:13:25,129 --> 00:13:27,170
candidate because he has money or the

322
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:29,749
odds that his child fanbase will revere

323
00:13:29,749 --> 00:13:34,470
him more as a god

324
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:37,260
I don't often speak on the topic of

325
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,940
stretching videos out to the 10-minute

326
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,280
mark for the sake of more ad revenue

327
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,270
particularly with the ad pocalypse stuff

328
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:44,760
going on if that some people's hustle no

329
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,130
problem with it the problem is when you

330
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:48,960
don't actually fill that space with more

331
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,330
content you just stretch your outro out

332
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,490
three minutes long four minutes long

333
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:55,920
that's fucking retarded I love you guys

334
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,630
subscribe for your new comment I read

335
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:59,700
all cars and now I try to make this

336
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:06,440
video somehow ten minutes

337
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,920
you

338
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,080
one thing that he's very disingenuous

339
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,660
about is when he states that all of his

340
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:16,240
videos are jokes all of my bills are

341
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,530
jokes a lot of people don't understand

342
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:19,000
this people get actually mad at me like

343
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,010
y'all relax all my bills are jokes is

344
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:23,320
just for fun I have no beef against this

345
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,870
kid no they're not and it's very obvious

346
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:28,270
to anyone who watches your videos that

347
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,770
they're not all jokes

348
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:32,080
you're not playing character alright

349
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,390
that is you you are being yourself in

350
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:36,070
these videos oh no I get it

351
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:37,930
you're so spineless that you want to

352
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:39,430
have it both ways you want to basically

353
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:41,440
be able to say yeah I roasted this

354
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,600
person in the past but it was all jokes

355
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,390
it was all jokes if you want to suggest

356
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:48,460
that some amount of your videos are

357
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,350
jokes go for it you know it's very

358
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:52,240
obvious to all of us that your beef with

359
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,370
Logan Paul is just a bunch of fake shit

360
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:58,300
oh no Logan stole my clothes what am I

361
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:04,510
gonna do oh look at this bro where's my

362
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:06,610
supreme and Gucci and babe that is all

363
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:08,560
fake beef so if you want to call that a

364
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,810
joke go for it but you are undoubtedly

365
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:13,180
the biggest fence rider on YouTube you

366
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,010
would just as soon make a diss track on

367
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:17,020
Logan Paul as you would drop to your

368
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:23,530
knees and suck him

369
00:15:23,530 --> 00:16:03,910
[Music]

370
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:24,960
[Music]

371
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,940
now we're gonna talk about the Gabi

372
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:28,470
situation and if you're not familiar

373
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:30,330
with it I'll bring you up to speed

374
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:32,040
these two are attending a party together

375
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,680
she goes up to him with snapchat in hand

376
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,750
and says I challenge you to a freestyle

377
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,300
she's pestering him she says you don't

378
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,339
have your Ghost Rider here do you bitch

379
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:44,100
he's obviously quite scared so he does

380
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,930
the only thing that he thinks he can do

381
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:48,000
I had two losses that night I could have

382
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,500
walked away it looked like a bitch where

383
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,760
I could have did something about it and

384
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,290
I did something about it I dropped her

385
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:54,270
phone and I smashed it oddly enough is

386
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:56,310
enough you little stupid bitch I smashed

387
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:59,070
this phone I smashed this phone only two

388
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:00,810
options that's it that's all he has

389
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:02,550
there isn't a third option they got

390
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:04,260
swept under the rug and that's to play

391
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,150
along with it there isn't even an

392
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,280
infinite number of options that allow

393
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,380
you to do any number of things that

394
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,209
don't make you look like an asshole or a

395
00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:13,980
pussy I can't just sit there and look

396
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,809
like a bitch if you are ever so

397
00:17:15,809 --> 00:17:18,050
terrified of being put in an

398
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:21,179
improvisational situation that you smash

399
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:23,429
someone's phone for fear of looking like

400
00:17:23,429 --> 00:17:26,160
a bitch you sort of automatically just

401
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,590
look like a bitch I had two offers that

402
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,179
night I could have walked away and look

403
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:31,350
like a bitch or I could do something

404
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:31,980
about it

405
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,809
it's like he's describing the thought

406
00:17:33,809 --> 00:17:36,630
process of a wounded animal or a caveman

407
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:39,600
I either run away or I smash those are

408
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,220
the two options enough is enough you

409
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,170
little stupid bitch I smashed their

410
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:45,750
phone if you're a comedian if and if all

411
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,880
your videos are jokes the first thing

412
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,650
that comes to your mind is how can I

413
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:51,929
turn this into a joke nope

414
00:17:51,929 --> 00:17:54,450
you got the ape brain I can't just sit

415
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:56,160
there look like a bitch I just want to

416
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,080
mention as a side note that when he was

417
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,730
on drama alert he had said that when you

418
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:01,290
go to these youtuber parties it's

419
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:02,700
understood that you don't bring out your

420
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,320
phone and you don't film people really

421
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,280
without their permission

422
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,080
these youtuber parties people know to

423
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,440
write or you ask permission people do

424
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,720
film at those parties and you filmed at

425
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,270
those parties filming's fine when people

426
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:17,160
are okay with it you weren't okay with

427
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,890
it because you got bamboozled would you

428
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,320
guys like to hear the juiciest bit of

429
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,750
hypocrisy price didn't have through her

430
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,520
phone but I mean if you're gonna record

431
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,710
me at a party when I'm off guard this

432
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:30,960
girl literally came up to me in person

433
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,150
didn't ask me hey rice do you mind if I

434
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:35,070
blog she just gave us a camera already

435
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:35,960
on and I was

436
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,850
unexpected it kind of sounds like he

437
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,620
doesn't like being recorded without his

438
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:42,230
consent how interesting

439
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:43,670

443
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,760
you don't trust him fuck out of here you

444
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,130
snitches mad I what I got nudes bro but

445
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:56,900

446
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,360
I never know why I even lied bro fucking

00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:05,440
people snitch way too much

448
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,620
he is very entitled so entitled in fact

449
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,630
then when he's not invited to a YouTube

450
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:12,910
related event he has to tell everyone

451
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:14,890
about it instead they decided to hook up

452
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:16,960
like Tyler Oakley are these water set of

453
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,850
youtubers and fly math stuff and hook

454
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:21,130
those guys up and not even hook me up if

455
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:22,480
you're watching this right now you to

456
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,340
have all those guys that are irrelevant

457
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,710
now but you know it was at least show

458
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:28,660
respect to the people that was granted

459
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,850
you know hard as shit I can understand

460
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:32,560
whining like a bitch because you didn't

461
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,450
get invited to YouTube rewind

462
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:36,850
what I can't understand at all is why

463
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:38,950
you would bring up other youtubers names

464
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:41,380
and talk about their numbers and how

465
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,690
irrelevant they are these neighbors are

466
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:44,980
upset if I'm calling you out of these

467
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:48,070
people right here were popping in 2015

468
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:51,520
2014 late but in 2016 like who like

469
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,720
there were so many people in the field

470
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,670
that was like who the fuck like who are

471
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:56,650
these people you are so stupid that you

472
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:58,150
don't even realize that that question

473
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:59,890
could be asked of you in a matter of

474
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:01,870
years I guess you should just hope that

475
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:03,820
future relevant youtubers aren't as

476
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:06,160
mentally deficient as you during this

477
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,840
year at VidCon there was this very

478
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,910
annoying Instagram kid who is making a

479
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:12,100
fool of himself by disrespecting the

480
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:17,050
VidCon staff of course he had to make a

481
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,210
video on this kid you might be wondering

482
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:21,430
what could he possibly criticize this

483
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:24,670
kid for that he hasn't done himself not

484
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:27,160
much cannot believe these are actual

485
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,750
words coming out of another humans now

486
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,730
we get it bro you're rich you're famous

487
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,110
but that does not give you the right to

488
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:33,700
be me and call these security guards

489
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,110
irrelevant like they're literally just

490
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,820

494

irrelevant himself I don't know how he's

506
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:10,460
missing the point it's almost as if he

507
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:12,320
thinks this kids actions would be

508
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,050
justified so long as he has the numbers

509
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:16,820
to back it up him being an asshole

510
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:19,490
cannot be justified by his large

511
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:21,140
following the world doesn't owe you shit

512

youtube viewers yes if he had your

516
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,550
YouTube viewers he would be as arrogant

00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:36,770

525
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:52,940
whenever someone drags themselves he

526
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,980
thinks that is now an opportunity to

527
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,140
brag because the focus is on them yeah

528

it's helping out you know depressed fans

529

535

540
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,840
not enough to be a YouTube star who gets

541
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,660
a lot of views by being an asshole why

542
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,910
do you also then have to say by the way

543
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:31,880
I'm also a nice guy who helps out

544
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,660
depressed fans one of his very notorious

545
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:37,550
practices is to bring up people's names

546
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:39,830
with the most feeble excuses the

547
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:41,450
beginning I really liked his videos Oh

548
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:43,250
at the beginning you like all my stuff

549
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:45,200
but like what so now all my newer videos

550
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,970

551
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:48,770
ago he tweeted gonna make a new channel

552
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:51,080
where I only do roasts and dis track so

553
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,700
I can whore out everyone's name in the

554
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,250

555
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:57,200

556
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,270
going on his likes tweet it says rise to

557
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:01,280
them starter pack as a result of this

558
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,440
he's constantly baiting out who the next

559
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,720
diss track is gonna be on is it gonna be

560
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,970

561
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:10,130
me and has never mentioned my name is it

562
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:11,540
gonna be about this person who

563
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:14,240
referenced an ambiguous Asian character

564
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:20,870
I don't think there's ever been a better

565
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:22,850
way to inflate your own ego than

566
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:25,400
fabricating your own genius video so you

567
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:30,150
have an excuse to explain your lyrics

568

[Music]

569
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:42,320
this isn't a joke this is a real thing

570
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,960
on top of being a musician he also

571
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,850
thinks that he's a really good music

572
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:49,430
critic my first hit single every night

573
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:51,770
says is on the Billboard Top 100 this

574
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:53,030
was the first official song I've ever

575
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:56,060
done Wow Wow that's incredible

576
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,470
anyways I just really have a really good

577
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:59,300
grasp on music and show good music form

578
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,070
everything basically I know what's going

579
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:05,240
on yeah there's a ton of youtubers own

580
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,250
it she's trying to rap they need to stop

581
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,510
but I feel like you just stopped making

582
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:10,190
music and just stick to what he's good

583
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:11,840
at she's really not that good at music

584
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,070
she really stopped doing busy it just

585
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,570
stick to what she is good at at least

586
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:16,760
get better every song like me I'm the

587
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,990
best but I'm slowly working on my flow

588
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:25,340
better this is so rich to think that

589
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,800
other people should stop making music

590
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,720
cuz they're not improving

591
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,240
it just sounds bad have you heard your

592
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,700
own shit all your fans are tense they

593

598

599
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,740
every solving reality I'm the best but

600
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:56,270
I'm slowly working on my flow it is not

601
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:58,130
a coincidence that your music has

602
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:00,560
improved since moving to LA you're now

603
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,930
utilizing a professional music studio

604
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:05,150
where someone else is mixing and

605
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:06,890
mastering all your music they're

606
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:09,020
probably writing the catchy bits for you

607
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,970
you have someone who's filming all the

608
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:13,160
videos for you and you still probably

609
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,890
have the ghostwriter on payroll you have

610
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:18,440
nothing to be boastful about you fucking

611
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:25,040
moron he's such a faggot they're just

612
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,720
thrown out diss tracks cuz they get

613
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,610
views yeah I can't think of a single

614
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:31,160
other person who would do that for Bill

615
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:35,090
us7 honey if there's one thing to take

616
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:37,190
away from this video it's that he

617
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:39,500
doesn't want to be known as a bitch I

618
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,030
can't just sit there and look like a

619
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:42,590
bitch I could have walked away look like

620
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:44,480
a bitch so I want you guys to keep that

621
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,000

sins now it's time to finish where we

629
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,220
started maybe at the end he might

630
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,960
squeeze a district in there to show

631
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,580
people that he can't you know you know

632
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:09,320
