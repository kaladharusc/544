1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:04,095
The Swedish Chef is back, everybody!

2
00:00:04,095 --> 00:00:06,435
Today, we're gonna cook...

3
00:00:06,435 --> 00:00:07,715
lasagna (Wow!)

4
00:00:07,715 --> 00:00:10,640
But not just any lasagna,

5
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,060
dead meme lasagna.

6
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,640
à la Ugandan Knuckles, everybody.

7
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,415
That's right. A new series. 500 parts, coming--

8
00:00:17,415 --> 00:00:19,545
Stop zooming, I can see what you're doing. (chuckles)

9
00:00:19,545 --> 00:00:23,025
Basically, I was going to cook lasagna, and I thought:

10
00:00:23,025 --> 00:00:25,455
&quot;Why don't we turn it into a meme?&quot;

11
00:00:25,455 --> 00:00:28,345
So we're going to try and make Ugandan Knuckles

12
00:00:28,345 --> 00:00:29,575
out of lasagna.

13
00:00:29,575 --> 00:00:32,895
So let's do this! Let's frigging do this, guys.

14
00:00:32,895 --> 00:00:35,080
So let's do-- (laughs)

15
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,020
Okay, step 1. Wash your hands.

16
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:41,415
Dab on them germs!

17
00:00:41,415 --> 00:00:42,435
 

18
00:00:42,435 --> 00:00:45,535
Step 1. We're going to make the minced...

19
00:00:45,535 --> 00:00:48,385
Oh! Step 1. Turn on the oven.

20
00:00:48,385 --> 00:00:49,980
I knew that one.

21
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,280
I've done this before, okay? So if you think this isn't going to go well...

22
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,840
(Pewds messing up with the ingredients)

23
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,280
Step 1. We chop the onion.

24
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,300
Now, a lot of people don't seem to know how to chop an onion,

25
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:08,040
based on what I did last episode. Everyone was like: (childish complaining)

26
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,320
This is how you do it, okay?

27
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,860
Unless you're a moron

28
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:17,545
Now the reason I like onions is because of...

29
00:01:17,545 --> 00:01:22,895
The layers. Thank you Marzia. Which is why...

30
00:01:22,895 --> 00:01:25,405
we're making...

31
00:01:25,405 --> 00:01:27,100
As you can see,

32
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:30,220
I'm really good at chopping.

33
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:33,555
Pewds: Such a backseat driver
Marzia: Like this

34
00:01:33,555 --> 00:01:37,065
Pewds: Yeah, but that's not how I want to do it.
Marzia: Like that, and then you do it like that.

35
00:01:37,065 --> 00:01:40,080
Marzia: So then you do it like that!

36
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,000
Pewds: So Marzia doesn't know how to chop an onion, apparently.
Marzia: Mhmm...

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,845
This is how you cut an onion, okay?

38
00:01:45,845 --> 00:01:49,275
No big pieces. Disgusting! And by the way, I don't cry.

39
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:52,540
Vikings, real Swedish people don't cry.

40
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:55,380
Now it's time to...

41
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,720
Cook it! Yeah! Now in Sweden, we use

42
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,960
butter to cook our meals.

43
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,325
Not some stupid oil.

44
00:02:03,325 --> 00:02:05,480
Ignore everything!

45
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,460
(laughs)

46
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:11,940
Now, we got what in Sweden, we call a &quot;kastrull.&quot; (saucepan)

47
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,415
Here's the thing. Why can't they design--

48
00:02:14,415 --> 00:02:17,375
like one of these, what's it called, a cutting board? That like, you can

49
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:20,055
flip up the edges, right? So then you pour the stupid--

50
00:02:20,055 --> 00:02:26,115
Pewds: Do you feel this?
Marzia: Mhmm

51
00:02:26,115 --> 00:02:29,155
So basically, right now we're making like the Bolognese.

52
00:02:29,155 --> 00:02:32,080
Some of you guys were commenting that I'm using soy meat

53
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,400
like I'm some sort of soy boy...

54
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,100
That's not it at all. I don't understand.

55
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:45,540
I need to finish this.

56
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:55,660
Add the tomato thing.

57
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:58,460
Marzia: Is that the blood? (laughs)

58
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,400
Pewds: This is the blood of the Ugandan Soldiers.

59
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,360
To make the meme spicy, we need some thyme,

60
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,520
and a tablespoon of Rosemary.

61
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,660
There you go.

62
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:10,820
And a quatro, everybody. Now,

63
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,665
Let that sh--

64
00:03:12,665 --> 00:03:14,460
Mix it. Nice and good,

65
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,680
We're basically just making Bolognese.

66
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:22,960
Director Pewds: Get some nice shots. Like some NICE shots. Like Gordon Ramsay all the time, nice shots.

67
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,140
That looks okay, I guess. (laughs)

68
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:29,760
Fun fact about lasagna. In Italy, it's not called lasagna.

69
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,920
*mind blown* 
Marzia: OOO!
Pewds: It's called what?

70
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,220
Marzia: Pasticcio
Pewds: Pasticcio. Huh!

71
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,740
Donde esta?

72
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,760
Quels elle aimont?

73
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,940
Marzia: That's not Italian.

74
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:43,935
This is going to go on lower heat.

75
00:03:43,935 --> 00:03:45,895
Right, hello.

76
00:03:45,895 --> 00:03:49,705
Next up, we're gonna use *not* soy milk

77
00:03:49,705 --> 00:03:52,775
to make the sauce. Some very good

78
00:03:52,775 --> 00:03:59,945
manly sauce ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Damn, dog.

79
00:03:59,945 --> 00:04:03,300
Aren't you, aren't you lucky to have such an

80
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,220
amazing chef in the house?

81
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,075
Melt the butter.

82
00:04:07,075 --> 00:04:09,495
And then you add the...

83
00:04:09,495 --> 00:04:11,965
the flour.

84
00:04:11,965 --> 00:04:15,035
I think? And a lot of milk. One litre of milk.

85
00:04:15,035 --> 00:04:16,265
of *real* milk

86
00:04:16,265 --> 00:04:17,775
The thing about milk

87
00:04:17,775 --> 00:04:22,845
is that it boils when you're not looking.

88
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:24,425
It's what my momma always
(Marzia laughs)

89
00:04:24,425 --> 00:04:27,425
Shout out to my mom!

90
00:04:27,425 --> 00:04:30,335
Four...

91
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,385
Five...

92
00:04:31,385 --> 00:04:34,245
And then you gotta keep whisking it. Right?

93
00:04:34,245 --> 00:04:36,465
Because...
Marzia: IT BOILS WHEN YOU'RE NOT LOOKING!

94
00:04:36,465 --> 00:04:39,880
Pewds: That's right. You learn fast, Marzia. I gotta say, very good.

95
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,140
Okay, I forgot you have to add one of these.

96
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:45,980
You see that? It's boiling. And I was looking. I was looking mom, I swear.

97
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:48,135
Now I forgot to mention, you wanna

98
00:04:48,135 --> 00:04:53,080
taste it as you go, right? To make sure.
Marzia: Mhmm.

99
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,380
It's salted and peppered correctly.

100
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,040
Now we're gonna add uh...

101
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,495
cheese in it.

102
00:04:59,495 --> 00:05:01,475
Which kind of...

103
00:05:01,475 --> 00:05:05,100
Marzia: Is it real cheese?
Pewds: Yeah. Which kind of goes against the point.
(both laugh)

104
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,060
Alright, I like cheese, so I'm just gonna add a lot of it.

105
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:12,360
And as always, you gotta taste it.

106
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,340
It's so hot! Done. Done, looking thick, boy!

107
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,760
It's THICC!

108
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,625
I added in a little extra flour. It was a bad idea and now it's all sticky...

109
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:24,635
Don't! (multiple tsks) I don't wanna have close-ups right now.

110
00:05:24,635 --> 00:05:27,580
And now for the fun part,

111
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:31,780
the lasagna making-- The Unganda making. Let's go, right over there.

112
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:35,085
*Claps* Food Review
Marzia: Wait!

113
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:38,060
So lasagna is kind of like

114
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,200
building legos.

115
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:44,600
Start off by making a base of lasagna.

116
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,660
Marzia: But also, how does it work with this? I've never--
Pewds: *claps* Meme--
Marzia: Ok.

117
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,445
Oh, look how thick that is.

118
00:05:50,445 --> 00:05:52,315
Look at the thickness, Marzia.

119
00:05:52,315 --> 00:05:55,525
Pewds: You see that thickness, you're getting the thickness?
Marzia: Mhmm. Mhmm.

120
00:05:55,525 --> 00:05:57,580
This is what you want, you want it real thick.

121
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:00,425
So you pour a quarter of it,

122
00:06:00,425 --> 00:06:03,860
evenly across, as I'm doing right now.

123
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:07,960
That was a little more-- That was perfect, that was perfect. As always. Now!

124
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,520
Same meme, different sauce.
Marzia: Do you not?

125
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,340
Marzia: ok.
Pewds: What?

126
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,065
Add the...

127
00:06:17,065 --> 00:06:19,595
the meat thing.

128
00:06:19,595 --> 00:06:22,055
A quarter, I think?

129
00:06:22,055 --> 00:06:23,740
What am I doing?

130
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:27,100
Ok, and then just like...

131
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,780
That's it.

132
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:32,160
That's it, that looks beautiful. Just make sure it's evenly across.

133
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,780
You know? Just like that. Just like that.

134
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:38,880
Another layer. Bazinga! As I like to call it.

135
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,880
Oh, look at that. Huh?

136
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,520
Pretty smart.

137
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,120
Ooh! That's satisfying.

138
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,140
It's almost like Tetris. Look at that.

139
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:52,760
*Tetris Music*

140
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:56,540
Oh! Did I say a quarter? I meant half. Same thing.

141
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:01,100
Same meme, different sauce. Evenly across. My God, beautiful.

142
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:04,140
It's a very nice, Felix. Why don't you say that? You always say that.

143
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:06,660
Marzia: Mhmm.
Pewds: It's a very good, Felix.

144
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,200
You're a doing such a great a yob.

145
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,380
Marzia: Yob?
Pewds: (laughs)

146
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,435
Honestly, it looks real.

147
00:07:13,435 --> 00:07:15,880
Marzia: What do you mean?

148
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,080
Marzia: oh you mean, ok.
Pewds: Like a real lasagna.

149
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:26,340
Last but not least. The last piece-- You know what, I'm gonna go a little bit crazy. Look at that.

150
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:29,060
Are you guys feeling hungry at home?

151
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:34,995
*claps* Damn, now I remember. The last bit of the-- the sauce.

152
00:07:34,995 --> 00:07:37,420
On top. On top.

153
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,100
So did I say a quarter?

154
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,820
Marzia: Oh my God. (laughs)

155
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,660
I meant a third, okay?

156
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,700
Then you add the cheese on top.

157
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:51,800
The cheese on top is the best bit, right?

158
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,095
Marzia: ???

159
00:07:55,095 --> 00:07:57,685
Actually, I'll just okay. There you go.

160
00:07:57,685 --> 00:08:00,455
I think I might have to use the tomato purée.

161
00:08:00,455 --> 00:08:04,195
Should I do his face like this? Or like this?

162
00:08:04,195 --> 00:08:05,585
Marzia: Like that.

163
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:08,680
Marzia: Wait, are you just doing the face? Do the whole thing!

164
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,520
But he's so fat and chubby.

165
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:14,820
Okay, let me start a little bit, and see how well I can decorate. I'm feeling this. Yeah.

166
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:18,580
Marzia: Yeah! You can do the body now. He is strong!

167
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:21,560
Pewds: Ugandan strongles, everybody. Yes!

168
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,660
Marzia: Cute little legs.

169
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:26,360
Pewds: This is so bad!

170
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,380
Marzia: That's terrifying.

171
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:32,800
(laughter)

172
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,940
Pewds: Yes...

173
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:39,580
If you're like a 40 year-old mom, and you want your kids to eat your lasagna,

174
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:42,635
Just add the memes!

175
00:08:42,635 --> 00:08:45,405
Do you know de wei?

176
00:08:45,405 --> 00:08:46,585
No

177
00:08:46,585 --> 00:08:49,795
I don't.

178
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:52,305
(laughs)

179
00:08:52,305 --> 00:08:54,295
That's the nose.

180
00:08:54,295 --> 00:08:58,205
Marzia: Do you not have olives?
Pewds: No

181
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:00,840
Don't worry, it won't taste that bad.

182
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:05,200
Marzia: But, (mumbles)

183
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,500
Pewds: That's great, that's fantastic.

184
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:12,340
He's beautiful. A little smile.

185
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:15,485
Which will definitely be there after....

186
00:09:15,485 --> 00:09:19,600
I cook him. Now, let's pop this bad boy in the oven.

187
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,760
For...

188
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,700
A coup-- a coup--

189
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:31,415
He's gonna go off to Unganda, everybody.

190
00:09:31,415 --> 00:09:34,540
Alright, we got 15 minutes left, and uh,

191
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,620
Yup, it definitely (laughs)

192
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:41,580
It still looks... Pretty decent.

193
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,520
Marzia: Wow
Pewds: (clicks tongue multiple times)

194
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,515
No? I thought we were going to do it in unison.

195
00:09:45,515 --> 00:09:46,860
Marzia: ok ok ok.

196
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:51,180
No, it's over. The spirit of-- Oh my god!

197
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,200
(Laughs)

198
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,440
It's still somewhat intact.

199
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,500
ok

200
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:02,680
I wanna be careful. Because it's kind of slippery, this thing.

201
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,380
Oh, there he is.

202
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:09,100
The Ugandan Lasagna! (TM)

203
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,860
Look at that! Incredible.

204
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,860
And it looks edible too.

205
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,020
Damn

206
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:18,560
You're supposed to make it wait, actually. Make it wait? That's right.

207
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,480
Looks good!

208
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,520
Dinner is served!

209
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:26,120
(Do u kno de wei)
In five minutes. You gotta... You gotta let it cool down.

210
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,440
I'm not gonna burn my tongue.

211
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,080
Make a smile.

212
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,845
Hee

213
00:10:30,845 --> 00:10:34,280
Thank you for reviving me as a dead meme.

214
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:38,120
I hope this will serve you as a final gift.

215
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,460
It's beautiful! But what does it taste like?

216
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:44,940
Now since I didn't put cheese on top, you don't get that...

217
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,720
Marzia: Crispy?
Pewds: But, you know...

218
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,060
I got a Ugandan Knuckles on top, so.

219
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:59,780
Don't worry about the consistency if you don't get it completely right. Jesus!

220
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:02,600
Wow! That looks great.

221
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,580
Maybe I added a little too much sauce. But you know,

222
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:08,760
Sometimes in life, you gotta sauce it up.

223
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:17,725
Okay, let's see how it tastes like.

224
00:11:17,725 --> 00:11:19,215
Marzia: What?

225
00:11:19,215 --> 00:11:21,740
It's really good, but it tastes just like

226
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:27,400
the one you just heat in the oven. (laughs)

227
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:32,120
Alright, let's see what the queen says.

228
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,960
Marzia: It's good
Pewds: It's good everybody. It's good

229
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,155
If you guys wanna make it yourself,

230
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:39,435
Post with hashtag

231
