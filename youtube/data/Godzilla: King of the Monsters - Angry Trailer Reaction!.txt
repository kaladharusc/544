10
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,910

11

20
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:52,289
Godzilla film they were like the

21
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:55,199
incestual brother-sister thing from from

22
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:56,460

00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,600
our trailer reaction in three two one

28
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:13,530
let's do it

29
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,280
our world is changing the mass

30
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,720
extinction we feared a powa my egg you

31
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,790

32
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,350
that's nice

33
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,390
a lot of people may ask about that flag

34
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:29,370
that flag is to honor the missing in

35
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:37,770
action

36
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:43,140
it is quite a sight to behold jump from

37
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,150

everybody knows how much fan your fan of

70
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,099
Godzilla the roar is everyday icon so it

71
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:56,849
looks like the this film understands

72
00:03:56,849 --> 00:03:59,280
what we fuckin wanted we want to see

73
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,139
more monsters we want to see monster

74
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:06,109
action all the major Rockton and man

75
00:04:06,109 --> 00:04:11,159
that scene words like apocalypse oh yeah

76
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:13,219
yeah okay so let's let's go through this

77
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:17,310
so obviously starts off with I don't

78
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:19,079
know how she's connected to this and

79
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,549
obviously they're gonna put this flag in

80
00:04:20,549 --> 00:04:21,959
here for a particular reason maybe your

81
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:25,199
father is missing in action right in

82
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,539
some kind of war then he comes back or

83
00:04:27,539 --> 00:04:30,360
something and that's the character we

84
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,960
see over here maybe I'm just throwing a

85
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,430
lot of guesses out there just from the

86
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,870
trailers our first reactions

87
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:39,570
alright what's on it B is back or I'm

88
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:40,889
gonna try to pronounce his name but he's

89
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:42,750
a great great actor I liked him in the

90
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,490
first film glad to see him here and

91
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:48,270
we've got this character who's ice-cubes

92
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:58,440
son right yes do you know this I wasn't

93
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,340
sure it was the son for for certain

94
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:05,580
O'Shea Jackson jr. okay I mean how can

95
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:13,409
you not recognize the space alright this

96
00:05:13,409 --> 00:05:17,580
is so cool because look at this this is

97
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,560
like the opposite of the first Godzilla

98
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,229
they're in all and what are they doing

99
00:05:22,229 --> 00:05:24,120
they are putting their eyeballs on the

100
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,060
monster they're looking at it it's it's

101
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,669
beautiful but yet scary but yet

102
00:05:29,669 --> 00:05:31,919
captivating and the first film had this

103
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,020
dumb idea where is they go are you guys

104
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:39,840
you can see it all

105
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:46,240
ya know so this this look you know and

106
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,409
this is yup they found him that's King

107
00:05:50,409 --> 00:05:53,500
Ghidorah Joe they one of Godzilla's

108
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,169
biggest rivals and enemies cuz there

109
00:05:56,169 --> 00:05:59,979
should be he had all those heads have

110
00:05:59,979 --> 00:06:01,780
like their own version of laser breath

111
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:04,030
atomic breath and it's like three gods

112
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,860
are the kind of things it's crazy and

113
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,199
eventually it can I don't want to ruin

114
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:12,759
any 20 years 15 billion films they can

115
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:15,310
fly you can sprout wings and and so it's

116
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:19,240
basically yeah well no I think you're

117
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:25,960
talking about so I think maybe this is

118
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,949
Mothra in larva form or something here

119
00:06:29,949 --> 00:06:33,400
comes Godzilla and he is again all

120
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,120
eyeballs

121
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,580
I don't know why he's coming out like

122
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,349
room man you motherfuckers woke me up

123
00:06:38,349 --> 00:06:41,830
yeah and then here mother is real tied

124
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:44,680
to the earth and tied to you know just

125
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,380
goodness and and positive energy and so

126
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:50,800
that's going to be really yeah and we're

127
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,840
wondering about Rodin he's Rodin a bad

128
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,479
guy he has been bad but yet he's kind of

129
00:06:55,479 --> 00:06:57,159
been an antihero kind doing his own

130
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:59,080
fucking thing taking out some gems and

131
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,669
then he's into Alton king of all

132
00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:02,469
monsters when they fight in previous

133
00:07:02,469 --> 00:07:04,270
films where all the monsters fighting

134
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:06,849
you didn't give a fuck and so I'm just

135
00:07:06,849 --> 00:07:09,039
really Wow looking forward to look at

136
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,900
this wing cramp destroying freaking

137
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:14,220
houses just by flying over them

138
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:17,190
no idea what's going on here but this

139
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:20,680
Godzilla film I think is gonna make all

140
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,169
audiences happy hardcore Godzilla films

141
00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:38,889
fans here American Godzilla fans do you

142
00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:41,860
think that this is just dreams a dream

143
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,380
[Music]

144
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,240
is about to happen if we let these

145
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,470
monsters do it they Joe if it's real

146
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,440
this would be Resident Evil what is the

147
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:53,919
last one

148
00:07:53,919 --> 00:08:01,000
the final chapter there's gonna be

149
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,770
destruction so so one of the stories

150
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:04,300
lines is they took all of the monsters

151
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,250
these aliens and then they put them on a

152
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,050
planet and pit them against each other

153
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:11,229
for but I don't know if that's what's

154
00:08:11,229 --> 00:08:12,370
happening here cuz look at all this

155
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:14,560
weather shit our monsters controlling

156
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,419
this is though there's the earth angry

157
00:08:16,419 --> 00:08:18,010
controlling this or is breaking up again

158
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:24,640
from a savior I don't know dead Jaguar

159
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,310
look it up yourself but here it looks

160
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:29,200
like finally Godzilla is on our side

161
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:47,470
full-blown young Rodin is a bad guy

162
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,870
she have a personal connection with

163
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:52,360
Godzilla and that is actually some of

164
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,710
you might say well this fucking door

165
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:56,290
Marie do now man

166
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:59,650
that's 100% accurate for Godzilla films

167
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:02,350
you know there's always the humans

168
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:04,960
sometimes females sometimes male that

169
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,940
has a connection with Godzilla or

170
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,560
Godzilla's son which then has a

171
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,780
connection to Godzilla and so ghazal as

172
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,340
I all right you cool my son you cool

173
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:18,040
with me yeah oh so really hyped and this

174
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:22,690
may I first but don't let it be a dream

175
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:26,140

176
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:28,060
