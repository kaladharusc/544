[Music]

2
00:00:08,059 --> 00:00:11,730
DC Comics first of all I realize this is

3
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,410
probably not how you thought the story

4
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:14,250
would start

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,960
you mean with narration that's most

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,550
movies these days I think okay I'm all

7
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,020
for using animation to your advantage in

8
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,670
a fantasy world but this grappling hook

9
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,109
doesn't go anywhere near where she needs

10
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:23,519
it to go to get over this gap cartoon

11
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,170
cop is way better than most movie cops

12
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:26,640
because he actually shoots at the tires

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,199
but he's the same when it comes to aim

14
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:30,960
freakin a discount cursing the inside of

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,340
this truck is a Matrix Star Trek

16
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,930
holodeck background of greenish squares

17
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,239
also yes I know that is the netting

18
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:37,860
inside the truck bit but my question is

19
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,510
really this why does the truck need

20
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,250
netting all along each side of it just

21
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,840
what is this am i planning to haul a

22
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,789
bunch of Jack Jack's these asshats who

23
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:46,230
wastes tons of bullets firing on the

24
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:47,910
Batmobile must be thinking I've totally

25
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:49,079
got that magic bullet that's gonna

26
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:50,250
penetrate the fuck out of that

27
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,170
bulletproof glass just watch really I

28
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:53,610
admit the Batmobile is awesome and

29
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:54,899
everything but towing an armored truck

30
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:56,370
you can't just shoot a harpoon and

31
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:57,750
manipulate that thing willy-nilly it's

32
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,370
thousands of pounds after shooting it

33
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:00,899
Batgirl many times this guy decides

34
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:02,370
let's see if physics can take care of

35
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,589
this that girl doesn't get 75% skin burn

36
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:06,900
from this forced high-speed bailout no

37
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,600
foes now I'm no Killing Joke expert but

38
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,369
this movie seems very not Killing Joke

39
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:13,170
to me so far the strata can apparently

40
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,939
has tracking capabilities as if it's an

41
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:16,320
Ella copter or something they said they

42
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,430
could knock out the tracker on the

43
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,380
armored car I don't think they could

44
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,330
plug a computer in their ass I'm going

45
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:22,740
to assume that even the nerdiest of

46
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,360
computer nerds could not plug the

47
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,220
computer in their ass but it's possible

48
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,960
I'm not thinking fourth dimension dr.

49
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,790
Mann huh Barbara's friend tries to hook

50
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:30,990
her up with a man within the first few

51
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,220
seconds we see her out of costume

52
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,720
because you didn't know you were

53
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,220
watching How to Lose a Batman in ten

54
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:35,640
days

55
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,409
my dad's department has been setting up

56
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:40,259
city cams and reading a lot of 1984 but

57
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:41,790
I don't think that's related zoom and

58
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,439
enhance cliche also it's good to know

59
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,030
you can get to Gotham Street cams just

60
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,680
by going to the good ole each ttp

61
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,930
address oh great the eff out freaking

62
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:50,460
the eff out

63
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,810
this villain embodies all the classic

64
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,160
traits of villains with the compulsion

65
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,110
of sarcastic clapping can end the night

66
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:58,090
without a kiss is it about vanquishing

67
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:59,980
female foes that gets male villains all

68
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:00,640
date rapey

69
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,530
no seriously Batman stops off for coffee

70
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,090
at the Starbucks on the way to the crime

71
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:04,540
scene

72
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,070
what's that drive-thru conversation like

73
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:09,820
his name is Paris Paris Franz you're

74
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:10,330
kidding

75
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,680
just because you joke about it in movie

76
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,000
does not excuse this ridiculously

77
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,590
terrible character name and that's it

78
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,540
you speak in the words or law

79
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,250
god damn it Batgirl yes and this is not

80
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,750
a male/female thing it's a super

81
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,640
experience Batman super inexperience

82
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,470
Batgirl thing I thought you Brits like

83
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,300
the salt air that's racist they're

84
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,070
docked like close to town right does

85
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:28,000
this seem like a good spot to

86
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,620
assassinate someone in broad daylight

87
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:30,820
I can't they go with the let's take a

88
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,350
ride method where somebody's got a piece

89
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:36,760
of piano wire in the backseat these

90
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,230
monsters totally Wrath of Khan these

91
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:40,090
masked assailants look I know Gotham is

92
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,470
awful when it comes to crime but they

93
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,090
keep a truck involved in a crime in an

94
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:44,770
unguarded impound lot and just any

95
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:46,000
asshole can come strolling through here

96
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,739
and leave gifts first out of this Batman

97
00:02:47,739 --> 00:02:49,420
movie is a Batgirl movie which is fine I

98
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,890
just wish they titled it correctly

99
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:53,890
you're getting hot hotter just out of

100
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:55,570
curiosity where did she put that still

101
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:57,370
transmitting foam also it's kind of

102
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:58,780
insulting that Batgirl is this freaking

103
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,580
stupid like the confidence part I'm

104
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,230
totally down with but the reckless part

105
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:03,940
surely she's better than this this guy's

106
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,500
talking openly about his crimes in a bar

107
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,690
I'm sure maybe he owns the bar but still

108
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,370
how come no bars near me you have sexy

109
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:11,110
art on the walls like this Batgirl black

110
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,610
widows herself out of a hairy situation

111
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,230
seriously an elevator is your exit

112
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:15,489
strategy she came in through a window

113
00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:17,980
can't you go out that way Oh bull

114
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,630
Batgirl defeats Batman what the hell is

115
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,580
going on what the first off she wears a

116
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,680
bra under that second that top is that

117
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,570
easy to remove third how would you even

118
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:26,799
get aroused in the bat suit

119
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,120
not only is there limited room for

120
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,290
things to move around down there but

121
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:30,730
even touching bat girl's ass would be

122
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:32,260
like wearing rose gloves while caressing

123
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,480
the sign of a radial tire also did one

124
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,410
of you just happened to have a bat

125
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:36,910
condom on your belt because otherwise

126
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:41,400
bad pregnancy scare anyone

127
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,610
Demon's Boyer oh it was fantastic like

128
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:45,659
fireworks

129
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:47,489
thanks kitty purry on the left the

130
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:49,439
unnamed cafe utterly schools the

131
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:50,939
business to the right on signage here's

132
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,260
a small business tip don't put

133
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,819
hieroglyphs on your business name or

134
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:55,319
sign people need to be able to read that

135
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:56,879
Barbour gets ready to pay for her coffee

136
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,890
and holy cow expensive his coffee in

137
00:03:58,890 --> 00:03:59,579
Gotham City

138
00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:02,519
so do clingy feel trapped like I can't

139
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:04,500
move someone forgot to not draw or

140
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,939
animate this scene so it wouldn't be in

141
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:07,799
the movie we got a tip he might be

142
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:09,329
hiding out at the docks why the hell

143
00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:10,379
would he tell her this if she's off the

144
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:10,920
case

145
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,299
Batman does not seem to understand that

146
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:14,129
Batgirl lives by her own rules we'll

147
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:15,000
talk later

148
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,889
animated Batman movie is much more sex

149
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:18,269
in the city than I think it intended to

150
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:20,039
be I just noticed Batgirl decided to

151
00:04:20,039 --> 00:04:21,690
climb up and perch on top of this thing

152
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:22,860
which has to be the most uncomfortable

153
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,510
place in Gotham to be a disappointing

154
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,919
character whatever you assholes say

155
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,449
because he's Batman two questions like

156
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:28,800
how does he know this that or the other

157
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,419
thing I present you Batman being

158
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:31,500
completely unaware of his surroundings

159
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,389
and his Batmobile with all the gadgets

160
00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:35,070
it has can't detect the missile headed

161
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,900
its way thirty minutes in still totally

162
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,580
about girl movie and still totally not a

163
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,380
Batman movie only 45 minutes left to

164
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,479
turn it around must be that time of the

165
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:42,900
month

166
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,610
I don't doubt this guy's an asshole and

167
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:45,870
might say something like this I just

168
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,910
thought since we're in 2016 and all we

169
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:49,440
were past these kinds of insults being

170
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,180
written into screenplays also I don't

171
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,919
envy you the beating that's coming after

172
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:54,900
you made that remark idiot meanwhile in

173
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,880
Gotham The Killing Joke hasn't started

174
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,740
yet Barbara has a perfect view of every

175
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,150
relationship in the city almost halfway

176
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,470
through this movie and still no Joker

177
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,060
mark hamill is probably as pissed about

178
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,310
this as Leno is about Suicide Squad I'll

179
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,139
find some way to fill my time well you

180
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:08,310
could start by actually working at the

181
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:09,659
library instead of filling your time

182
00:05:09,659 --> 00:05:11,099
with gossiping and looking at street

183
00:05:11,099 --> 00:05:11,610
cameras

184
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:13,320
Batgirl quits being Batgirl because

185
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,699
something something abyss something

186
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:16,680
reasons Corona came in gaping sea

187
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,080
eyeball says these poor saps died

188
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,240
probably three years ago after her

189
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,770
briefly eyeballing these corpses the

190
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:23,909
coroner came up with a pretty specific

191
00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:25,470
timeline for when these assholes died

192
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:27,389
okay guys we need a sexy shot of a

193
00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:28,919
cartoon woman so let's get out the horny

194
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:30,539
paint Batman casually parked his car on

195
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:31,800
the street and takes the long walk up

196
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,479
the driveway rather than keeping his

197
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:35,190
ride nearby and out of general view I

198
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:37,349
know right how in the fuck did the Joker

199
00:05:37,349 --> 00:05:38,909
get another person into his cell make

200
00:05:38,909 --> 00:05:40,530
him up to look like him in an escape

201
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:43,139
well it's garish ugly and smells like

202
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:45,060
this I guess the first 30 minutes of

203
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,710
this movie were just so we could see how

204
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:48,690
much Barbara means to Batman the second

205
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:50,010
act feels so disjointed from the first

206
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:51,300
act though it's like it doesn't belong

207
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,130
in the story began telling okay now that

208
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:54,539
this movie is two different stories

209
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:56,610
completely time for a flashback why stop

210
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:58,229
it - when you can get three picture of

211
00:05:58,229 --> 00:05:59,729
the bet lady turns into a picture of a

212
00:05:59,729 --> 00:06:01,169
pregnant woman and those things are not

213
00:06:01,169 --> 00:06:03,029
the same Jesus whether any females

214
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,680
anywhere near the writing room for this

215
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,849
thing I have to go up on stage and

216
00:06:07,849 --> 00:06:10,529
nobody laughs what made this guy want to

217
00:06:10,529 --> 00:06:12,060
be a stand-up comedian any insight into

218
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,219
that is he a naturally funny guy and why

219
00:06:14,219 --> 00:06:15,330
was he writing all of his hopes on

220
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:16,620
getting into show business I'm

221
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:19,229
completely sold right about now I'm

222
00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:20,969
wondering why this guy who has an old

223
00:06:20,969 --> 00:06:22,650
amusement park for sale decided to show

224
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:24,120
a potential buyer the place during the

225
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,260
middle of the night and didn't get

226
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,669
freaked out at a guy in clown makeup

227
00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:27,659
showing up for the appointment

228
00:06:27,659 --> 00:06:28,979
I guess he's never heard of the Joker

229
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:31,020
there girls on the street or not in a

230
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,870
weekend without having to tell a single

231
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:37,050
joke or blow a punch line Joker thinks

232
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:38,219
that these girls on the street aren't

233
00:06:38,219 --> 00:06:39,630
spending their time blowing things I

234
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:42,870
love you job or no job you're good in

235
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:45,389
the sack and you make me laugh I tried

236
00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:46,710
to get my wife to use these as her

237
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:48,180
custom wedding vows at our wedding but

238
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,650
she put the kibosh on that something

239
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:51,300
fierce still don't know why whenever

240
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,380
you're about to get into some hardcore

241
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,090
Joker research you need to hold up an

242
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:55,710
average Joker card and stare at it to

243
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:56,969
get in the mood this movie is

244
00:06:56,969 --> 00:06:58,440
acknowledging a scene from Tim Burton's

245
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,210
Batman a movie incidentally that has a

246
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:01,710
completely different Joker origin story

247
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:03,719
except for the falling in acid part you

248
00:07:03,719 --> 00:07:06,389
can't save everyone so especially gifs

249
00:07:06,389 --> 00:07:07,260
you recently banked

250
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,880
what I mean you can't save everyone your

251
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,440
back I mean you can't save all the chick

252
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,900
off Barbara I swear you're fluffier than

253
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,849
your mother was weird that's the same

254
00:07:14,849 --> 00:07:16,500
exact thing Batman said to her just

255
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,240
after coming on his own cape because she

256
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,130
suddenly wanted to keep hers clean what

257
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:21,960
that's the dirtiest joke I've ever told

258
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,900
well did you see the Kari video you did

259
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:28,110
damn that must be Colleen she's early

260
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:29,729
we're gonna work out why did Gordon

261
00:07:29,729 --> 00:07:31,110
bring a scrapbook to Barbara's apartment

262
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:32,699
and why would Barbara invite him if she

263
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:34,169
knows Colleen is coming over to work out

264
00:07:34,169 --> 00:07:36,150
he was just robbing banks then but the

265
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:38,039
headline specifically says the Joker is

266
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:39,659
a murderer and a homicidal maniac

267
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:41,130
Joker shoots Barbara right in the uterus

268
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:42,690
for some reason Jesus do these sweaters

269
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:44,550
just fucking hate women also man this

270
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:46,080
bullet has unbelievable propulsive

271
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,810
powers in fact the idea for walking

272
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:51,360
anywhere seems remote our venue wasn't

273
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,930
built with the disabled

274
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,940
and joker seems to know that his gut

275
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,889
shot cause Batgirl paralysis even though

276
00:07:56,889 --> 00:07:58,479
science itself won't know this for hours

277
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,130
okay given the technology featured in

278
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:01,690
this movie we can assume the present-day

279
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:04,509
is someone around 2016 if the Joker's in

280
00:08:04,509 --> 00:08:06,190
his 50s then he'd have been of marrying

281
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,750
age around the late 80s or early 90s

282
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,639
definitely not a time when old-time

283
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:11,199
sailors were hanging out at bars like

284
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,310
they're about to be shipped out to fight

285
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:13,720
the Third Reich there's nothing really

286
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,190
wrong with anything the future Joker is

287
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,570
saying here I just need to point out

288
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:17,860
that the guy in a background is perhaps

289
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,449
the stillest motherfucker I have ever

290
00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:20,979
seen just a moment ago these crooks

291
00:08:20,979 --> 00:08:22,570
snapped at future Joker for not being

292
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:24,190
cool when talking about the robbery he's

293
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,539
helping them with now they open up an

294
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:26,860
incriminating bag and painting a red

295
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,539
hood that everyone's seen in the papers

296
00:08:28,539 --> 00:08:29,560
in front of everybody

297
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,539
can't make a nest without breaking a few

298
00:08:31,539 --> 00:08:34,930
eggs yeah that's funny

299
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:39,570
no it's cliche no it's neither of those

300
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:42,250
she'll never walk again doctor says this

301
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,419
after performing the most rudimentary

302
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:46,089
neurological test possible also few do

303
00:08:46,089 --> 00:08:47,709
did you not see Forrest Gump dirty

304
00:08:47,709 --> 00:08:49,149
rotten scoundrels the way he was faking

305
00:08:49,149 --> 00:08:50,890
in that movie also if she were Batman

306
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:51,880
they'd find a way to get her back to

307
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,380
health in at least three months she

308
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:56,410
found the victim in a state of undress

309
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,420
is the movie implying that in addition

310
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,980
to being shot and paralyzed Barbara

311
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,690
Gordon was also raped because that is

312
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:04,060
some heavy-ass for a Batman story let

313
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,130
alone a goddamn cartoon the implication

314
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:07,660
alone is sin worthy god damn how much

315
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,100
does this movie hate Batgirl

316
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,839
now hang the phone right there you're

317
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:12,040
telling me Joker had enough time to get

318
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,300
the lights on repair a lot of the

319
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,860
equipment decorate the park plant a

320
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,750
million TVs in the ghost train shoot

321
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,520
Barbara Gordon and build a throne on a

322
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,870
pile of creepy baby dolls

323
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,850
remember reason what our reason is based

324
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:25,150
on if we deny them we deny reason itself

325
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,350
Joker expounds this freshman-year

326
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:28,029
philosophy to a naked man in a roller

327
00:09:28,029 --> 00:09:29,170
coaster who's surrounded by little

328
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:32,529
people there is no sanity clause kids

329
00:09:32,529 --> 00:09:34,089
man hate to break it to you but Joker

330
00:09:34,089 --> 00:09:35,200
just spoiled the fact that there's no

333
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,380
of the trademark with this red hood

334

335

that is already wearing a suit and

336
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,839
bowtie that was an accident this morning

337
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:49,660
just seen a baby bottle heater the story

338
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,339
actually takes away any motivation that

339
00:09:51,339 --> 00:09:52,510
this guy would have to help this gang

340
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:53,800
but they're going to make him do it

341
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,140
anyway which is poignant i guess the way

342
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,820
things are some sort of moral lesson

343
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:00,250
learned i don't know all these

344
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,900
underground casino thugs attacked with

345
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,339
nothing but this i don't know about you

346
00:10:03,339 --> 00:10:04,720
but if i were opening my own underground

347
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,370
casino I'd hire thugs that carry guns

348

hookers I've ever seen I don't have any

352
00:10:12,819 --> 00:10:14,079
doubt that the Joker came up with this

353
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:15,850
song while he was in the asylum he's had

354
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:17,380
plenty of time to do that but what I

355
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,790
don't think he's had time to do is get

356
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,050
all of his carny folk properly

357
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:21,519
choreographed for this number then

358
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,709
there's a certain thing I do

359
00:10:23,709 --> 00:10:25,329
this goes on for some time amazing how

360
00:10:25,329 --> 00:10:26,380
tasteful these photographs are of

361
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,120
Gordon's naked paralyzed daughter Joker

362
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,920
was also able to take digitized and

363
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,810
upload to this ride multiple pictures of

364
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:33,370
a wounded Barbara well I gave the

365
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,589
breathe my voice sounds actly

366
00:10:35,589 --> 00:10:37,569
if the hood is that tight there's no way

367
00:10:37,569 --> 00:10:39,220
his voice would sound echo II said there

368
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,240
was no security

369
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,860
they must have altered things since I

370
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:44,380
left yeah but why was there a rash of

371
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,209
chemical robbery since he left as far as

372
00:10:46,209 --> 00:10:47,470
the unluckiest person I've ever seen

373
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:48,910
during an origin story that man

374
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,470
apparently abandons pursuit as soon as

375
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:52,120
Joker Falls after scare tripping him

376
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,860
don't worry guys he just landed in the

377
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,000
chemicals that changed your entire

378
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,589
appearance and make you go mad but they

379
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:57,880
aren't fatal rather than go right or

380
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,649
left around this dead guy Batman decides

381
00:10:59,649 --> 00:11:01,149
to get out of the car and walk down the

382
00:11:01,149 --> 00:11:02,470
completely open Midway isn't this the

383
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:03,940
fucking Dark Knight who always got the

384
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,050
drop on criminals by being one step

385
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:06,759
ahead how did the Joker convince all the

386
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:08,769
freaks of the already close carnival to

387
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:10,480
fight for him against Batman no worry

388
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,250
guys Batman's got a Binaca spray that

389
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,990
helps him treat wounds from Joker's acid

390
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:16,660
never leave home without it I feel my

391
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:20,019
point old engine man so Joker's whole

392
00:11:20,019 --> 00:11:21,550
plan was to drive Commissioner Gordon

393
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,019
mad feels like he could have come up

394
00:11:23,019 --> 00:11:24,310
with a better plan than this and one

395
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:25,509
that didn't require buying an old

396
00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:27,699
amusement park you had a bad day once on

397
00:11:27,699 --> 00:11:29,319
my ride - oh god please don't show

398
00:11:29,319 --> 00:11:30,519
Bruce's parents getting murdered again

399
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:31,600
please don't joke Bruce's parents

400
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,680
getting murdered again please don't show

401
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,180
booths problem with a surprise trapdoor

402
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,649
is once you start falling you shouldn't

403
00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:36,970
be able to reach the ledge but he's

404
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:38,740
Batman Joker takes out Batman with a

405
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,660
fucking lobster pot and I'm all done

406
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,459
with this movies Joker he's as sane as

407
00:11:42,459 --> 00:11:43,300
he ever was

408
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,069
I wonder if this plan to make Gordon

409
00:11:45,069 --> 00:11:46,269
insane would have worked if he had just

410
00:11:46,269 --> 00:11:47,980
killed Barbara instead of paralyzing her

411
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,750
I mean Joker gave Gordon and out in this

412
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,730
plan to make him think she was dead when

413
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:52,480
she really wasn't

414
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,130
that's a gift in this twisted world how

415
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,720
would this gun which shot real bullets

416
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,459
be able to shoot a joke sign once it was

417
00:11:57,459 --> 00:11:58,149
out of bullets

418
00:11:58,149 --> 00:11:59,529
but the second guy said what do you

419
00:11:59,529 --> 00:12:01,930
think I am crazy you just turn it off

420
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,970
when I'm halfway across it takes an hour

421
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:05,829
and 11 minutes for this joke to kill or

422
00:12:05,829 --> 00:12:13,750
whatever it is jokes - so what happened

423
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,639
did Batman kill the Joker did he put him

424
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:16,660
back in the asylum where he can

425
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,279
apparently escape it will whatever the

426
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,410
answer is simple it why would that joke

427
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:20,800
change

428
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,269
that man's mind about killing him why

429
00:12:22,269 --> 00:12:23,470
would he trust Arkham to keep

430
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:25,420
entertained there's no good answer tell

431
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,980
us what to thank for God's sake oh wait

432
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,930
there's more this is part of the story

433
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:30,310
that could only be told after a full

434
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:38,050
minute of credits that's frightened me
