Hello there. Don't you know who that is

23
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:29,500
Know qui gong gym. I didn't think Lego Star Wars is so hard

24
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,400
I don't know what's happening

25
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,060
It's okay. It's even more difficult cause I can't hear it

26
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:36,360
You play games on mute? Yeah.

27
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,810
That explains why it's so annoying to edit and the sound is always wrong

28
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:44,259
Okay, all right you don't edit my video

He said that you have very small... legs

31
00:01:55,930 --> 00:02:01,680
That is why you are always so short. I'm taller than you.

32
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,060
When does this happen in the movie? I don't know
