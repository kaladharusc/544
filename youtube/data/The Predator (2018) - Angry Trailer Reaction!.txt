we've got it's a big predator why is

14
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:08,380
this master there I didn't think we

15
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:09,820
could find a guy that looked more

16
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,920
generic than the new Robocop guy we

17
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,570
managed to find a fortune oh there's

18
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:16,210
always something we need to know he's

19
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:19,590
the ripoff Robocop guy Rick Flagg were

20
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:47,740
Rangers got a badass yeah yeah don't sit

21
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:51,190
around making hats and rib cages pick

22
00:01:51,190 --> 00:02:06,240
conquered space Oh

23
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:16,300
what of submit predators predator we may

24
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:22,360
die okay okay

25
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:36,910
come and get us motherfucker the

26
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:39,310
predator so they're gonna team up at the

27
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,990
end like you did with alien versus

28
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:44,830
Predator candy what one want some candy

29
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:47,110
now I hear that it might every time I

30
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:50,500
hear that sound okay uh Joe what do you

31
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:57,750
think a lot of action which is oh yes

32
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,730
looks like generic characters but as

33
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:04,510
long as the alien fight is badass I'm on

34
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:07,450
board we got the the mercenary at the

35
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:09,930
beginning who takes things from the sky

36
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:13,050
apparently and he knows a lot about

37
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:18,820
predators predators can't conquer the

38
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:27,190
galaxy if you're in a pen he's gonna

39
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:36,880
capture my guess cuz the Kouga no-name

40
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,660
trying to pronounce this alien species

41
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,519
anyway so they've conquered the galaxy

42
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:45,010
so it looks like we're getting some some

43
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:47,170
predator ship which I like seeing the

44
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:49,120
predator ship we're seeing plenty of

45
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,160
guns mercenaries military guys

46
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:57,610
crash-landing from the predator so so

47
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:59,860
odd casting choices is Olivia Munn an

48
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:02,440
odd casting choice at first you know I

49
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,760
kind of need jerk because we know her

50
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,340
from the video game world but but now

51
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,410
she's in movies and oh yeah she's doing

52
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:12,400
well so good on her that's excellent but

53
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,870
it they seem to be kind of low-rent B or

54
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:19,840
C films which has me worried about the

55
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,910
film you know it's always gonna be like

56
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:24,850
a B film it's not a good sign when I see

57
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:28,810
you know her but it looks like the film

58
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,240
is sort of rising above that so we're

59
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,580
getting a little bit of in the jungle

60
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,820
but it's not a jungle it's the forest

61
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:39,330
of Suburbia so that is that's cool

62
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:43,530
there's plenty of blood there snipers

63
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:47,100
what not gonna be pretty condense we've

64
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,450
seen without his mask

65
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:50,750
I don't know I'm actually pretty excited

66
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:54,060
this trailer made me excited all except

67
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,340
for these generic characters generic

68
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:59,640
white guys yeah black guy generic female

69
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,380
so as long as we have a badass fight

70
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,930
between the other two yeah we're

71
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,670
probably gonna be doing but and some of

72
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:07,650
the best parts of the terrible alien

73
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:09,330
versus Predator films is when the two

74
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,790
creatures fight each other so hopefully

75
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:15,140
people want to see some creature fights

76
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:18,750
and I'm one of my favorite storylines

77
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,520
from the alien versus Predator comic

78
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,420
books is when the Marines took the an

79
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,190
injured predator and was rolling him

80
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,110
around in their ABC and the other

81
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:29,730
predators would attack them thinking

82
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,050
that the Marines wanted to hurt the

83
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:32,280
predator but they were just kind of

84
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,200
giving him medical assistance and they

85
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,910
realized that later then they all get

86
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:37,530
ambushed and killed off and it's just

87
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:38,880
one marine and one predator and they

88
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,040
work together and I liked that stuff and

89
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,260
I like that at the end of the alien vs.

90
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,360
predator film with the one lady with the

91
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,000
dreads and she became a predator

92
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,210
apprentice it's kind of hokey with her

93
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:52,860
but do you think you'll get the same

94
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,440
vibe here at the end with that well I

95
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,990
want him to I want the predator to be an

96
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:01,080
antihero I don't want him to be a bad

97
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,550
guy throw the whole way through I want

98
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:05,280
this particular predator to be sort of

99
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,500
an antihero good guy fights the bigger

100
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,200
predator baby wins at the end and then

101
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,600
throws a trophy at one of the human

102
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,730
characters that helped him fight their

103
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:16,980
thing that there's the movie ladies and

104
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,320
gentlemen see we'll see if I predict it

105
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,510
in all of you not looking forward to

106
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:25,230
this this guy Ranger bombs vagina were a

107
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:29,729
video game and be rated E for Everyone

108
00:06:29,729 --> 00:06:33,550
Sookie okay I had a look at of his Kiki

109
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:37,000
from Skyrim special edition is in the

110
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,389
game is in there so he feels out of

111
00:06:40,389 --> 00:06:45,039
place but oddly I want him there he's

112
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,440
gonna be the comment if he survives this

113
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,960
he's the comedy relief and he's the most

114
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,789
recognizable face amongst all these

115
00:06:51,789 --> 00:06:53,680
generic dudes you know what it means so

116
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,810
whereas in other films I'd be like now

117
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:57,669
why is he there it was like all right

118
00:06:57,669 --> 00:06:59,199
I'm glad he's here he's like the only

119
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,539
guy that I give a shit about they better

120
00:07:01,539 --> 00:07:11,699
not freaking die we'll see yeah so look

121
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:15,340
look they captured him they captured him

122
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,500
and they're experimenting on him I guess

123
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,150
maybe what I was talking about before

124
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:21,580
but I don't think there's a parent or

125
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,199
group or an aliens Group hunting them

126
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,979
down at the same time they just had to

127
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:29,889
crash-landed ship they're experimenting

128
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:31,870
on his body he wakes up breaks out

129
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:34,000
starts fighting everybody there you go

130
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,539
what am I telling you so easy fucks up

131
00:07:40,539 --> 00:07:44,229
the military his Harley gave away quite

132
00:07:44,229 --> 00:07:46,389
a bit his armor is looking pretty cool

133
00:07:46,389 --> 00:07:48,760
yeah hopefully there is plenty of other

134
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,229
stuff that we haven't seen because it

135
00:07:50,229 --> 00:07:53,440
does seem like like Shane black that's

136
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,210
an encouraging thing here I think Shane

137
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:57,789
black can bring something new to the

138
00:07:57,789 --> 00:08:03,010
table sit around there's gonna be a

139
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:05,320
three survivors at the end the conquered

140
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:12,880
space see I'm gonna think here he's got

141
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,889
the hero where he wants him but he's not

142
00:08:14,889 --> 00:08:16,930
gonna kill him no cuz the guide comes in

143
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,729
some yeah they're gonna happen yeah oh

144
00:08:18,729 --> 00:08:23,880
yeah that's where the or the big or

145
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:30,130
altra super so maybe it is that he is a

146
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:33,250
bad guy oh that's kind of lame and then

147
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,659
it just so happens that this creature

148
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:37,529
shows up to save the hero and the

149
00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:39,969
creatures mindless and it just wants to

150
00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:41,279
attack

151
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,159
I don't know or at that point that's

152
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,870
where okay predators got we got to fight

153
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:48,959
that but here it looked like sort of an

154
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,819
ape kind of thing but then here it's

155
00:08:50,819 --> 00:08:53,490
like a normal predator just reminds me

156
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:56,939
of the orcs from lorkhan or something

157
00:08:56,939 --> 00:09:00,569
like that extremely tall but maybe he's

158
00:09:00,569 --> 00:09:02,189
also standing on

159
00:09:02,189 --> 00:09:04,709
oh no he's huge but he's also standing

160
00:09:04,709 --> 00:09:13,889
on so I'm interested because it doesn't

161
00:09:13,889 --> 00:09:15,300
look like they're partners did they

162
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,920
arrive on the same ship if they arrived

163
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,689
on the same ship did he originally

164
00:09:18,689 --> 00:09:21,059
capture him is he a bounty hunter and

165
00:09:21,059 --> 00:09:22,829
he's an outlaw

166
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:24,569
is he a super soldier that he was

167
00:09:24,569 --> 00:09:26,850
transporting why is he attacking him so

168
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:29,069
so a lot of interesting things I love

169
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,720
that they're focusing on the creatures

170
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,120
at least here exploring the backstory of

171
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,509
this is what I'm hoping for and plenty

172
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:43,650
of guns plenty of cat and mouse chasing

173
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:49,410
so come and get us motherfucker because

174
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:51,300
part of the film that's the end right

175
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:51,600
there

176
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:57,720
No come and get us yeah yeah yeah give

177
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:02,430
me give me I wonder if the predator is

178
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:04,400
going to display those sort of

179
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,390
intelligent properties or if he's just

180
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:08,339
gonna be a mindless killer I know this

181
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:10,470
one is gonna be a mindless ass killer

182
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:18,510
but the other one all right guys so

183
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:20,790
that's our opinion of the predator

184
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,410
trailer hopefully waiting in copyright I

185
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:24,180
might just have to put up the analysis

186
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,250
because Fox is super aggressive about

187
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:30,360
yeah but yeah all right encouraged I am

188
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,100
more excited to see the predator

189
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,260
I'm down for watching the predator and I

190
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,000
love this universe and I'd love to make

191
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,650
a board game out of it yeah I think it's

192
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:40,620
gonna be a nice be film be film yes a B

193

194
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,790
gonna be better or worse than venom how

195
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:50,430
about that question oh I would say it's

196
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:51,810
