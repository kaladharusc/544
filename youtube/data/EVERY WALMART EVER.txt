1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:04,060
So if you ever see a turd on the ground, just cover it with a paper towel.

2
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:07,299
Anyway, that concludes your 30 seconds of training. Any questions?

3
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:08,099
Yeah!

4
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:10,840
What if someone asks me where an item is and I don't know where?

5
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,800
Oh, it doesn't actually matter if you know where the

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,640
Items are or not. You just point to an aisle at the opposite side of the building and run away, like this.

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:24,200
Oh, the blenders are on aisle 7.[footsteps]

8
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,860
Wow, he's good.

9
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:34,520
Every Walmart ever.

10
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,340
Excuse me.

11
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,060
Hello, how can I help you?

12
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:38,620
Hi, I'm looking for the baby cribs.

13
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:39,160
Oh, yes.

14
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:43,040
Asle 22 between the guns and the children's guns.

15
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,750
Really?!

16
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,570
You know, that's great, 'cause I've been looking for a good children's gun.

17
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:50,800
Oh... We've got this cute little pink Glock for 40% off.

18
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,380
But you can get it for free if you shoot the cashier on the way out.

19
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:55,380
*Intense laughing*

20
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,380
 

21
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:58,260
 

22
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,270
Thanks so much.

23
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:02,440
Of course. Oh.

24
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,580
[whispering]I'm serious though.

25
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:08,700
Do you sell grenades?

26
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,300
Welcome to Walmart.

27
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,900
Where do they get all these old people from?

28
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:20,160
I have no idea.

29
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,420
Hey! Where are you taking me?!

30
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,800
Shhh! You belong to us now.

31
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,600
Alright then.

32
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,020
Here's your blue vest. Go f--k yourself.

33
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,260
(snickering)

34
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:34,120
 

35
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,300
Hey, Philip?

36
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,280
What?

37
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,100
These shelves are empty, Should I restock them?

38
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,420
Sure.

39
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,600
Uh, what goes here?

40
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,540
 

41
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,700
Uh...

42
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:48,740
It's been empty as long as I've been here. I don't get paid enough to care.

43
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:51,080
So I'm done?

44
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,560
Yeah, sure. Good job.

45
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,500
Thanks, Philip.

46
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,780
[Phillip] Whatever.

47
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,160
I'm not stealing iPods.

48
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,020
You have several iPods in your shirt.

49
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,100
Welcome to Walmart.

50
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,100
 

51
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:05,720
Ooh.

52
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:09,020
Excuse me, this is Walmart. We do have a dress code.

53
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:09,640
You do?

54
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,220
Mm-hmm.

55
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:17,420
[This is what happens in Walmart]

56
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:21,220
[muffled] Where did you store that?

57
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:27,560
Here. Put these on.

58
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,040
Ohhh, welcome to Walmart.

59
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,000
Thanks.

60
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Why is everyone pregnant?

61
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,580
 

62
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,500
(raucous fighting)

63
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:40,980
You're stepping on my shoes, now say excuse me.

64
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,760
Of course there's a fight at a Walmart.

65
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,940
So trashy.

66
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,350
(clearing throat)

67
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:52,659
Actually, we hire them to fight in here. Every time a fight video goes viral, we get a huge uptick in sales. It's guerrilla marketing tactics.

68
00:02:52,659 --> 00:02:53,580
 

69
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:54,659
YEAH! BITE HIM!

70
00:02:54,659 --> 00:02:55,360
 

71
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,659
GET HER!

72
00:02:56,659 --> 00:02:58,659
YEAH! OH! OH!

73
00:02:58,659 --> 00:03:00,659
YEAH! KNOCK HER OUT!

74
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:01,700
KNOCK HER-- OH!

75
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,740
Sir. I need you to pay for that.

76
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:06,680
No.

77
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,560
Yo. Excuse me.

78
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,060
What?

79
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,540
you have this in my size?

80
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,940
Let's go to the kids section.

81
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,960
Thanks.

82
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,410
There you go, kids extra small.

83
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:18,480
What the hell?!

84
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,840
Aisle 7!

85
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,460
[footsteps]

86
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,440
Where the Hell did he go?

87
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,760
Everything is $2.99 here.

88
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,780
Yoo-hoo!

89
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,050
Yodel-ay-hee-hoo!

90
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:39,300
Maybe instead of having those mass-produced factory cookies, you like to buy some homemade cookies from a nice mom-and-pop shop.

91
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,680
Mm, smells like a nice cookie.

92
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,290
Wow, I thought Walmart made you guys go out of business years ago.

93
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,660
Nope, as a matter of fact,

94
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:56,500
they did not. They actually just sort of built around us and didn't even notice us. Please, try a cookie. Please, please, try it?

95
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,900
Wow, these are really good.

96
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,980
Oh boy, Marjory, here comes our first sale in 5 years.

97
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:06,010
Okay, so how many would you like? They're only $4 a bag.

98
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:07,540
These are only

99
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,260
3.79.

100
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:08,760
Yes.

101
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:15,640
But no child had to die to make our cookies. This is just good old-fashioned homestyle cooking, right, Marjory?

102
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,920
Yeah, no child labor.

103
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,330
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

104
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:23,890
Guess I don't really care though. Thanks for the cookie.

105
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:27,840
Don't say it. Don't say it, Geraldine. Don't say it. Don't say it.

106
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,780
- F--k!
- Oh!

107
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:30,480
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I said it.

108
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,280
