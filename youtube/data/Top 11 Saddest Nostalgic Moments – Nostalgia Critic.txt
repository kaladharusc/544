mouse continues to look for them anyway

tease he thinks he hears his father's

85
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,840

of the best cartoon shorts of all time

00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:06,860
it was epic

home it's not like Charlie Brown was a

122
00:06:20,289 --> 00:06:22,690
very upbeat cartoon to begin with so the

123
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:24,280
idea of doing a whole section of the

124

movie that was meant to make you feel

125

sad is just downright cruel the scene

involves Snoopy as he decides to leave

127
00:06:30,129 --> 00:06:31,870
home and go live with his original owner

128
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:33,819

cute and lovable as Charlotte did but

169
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,000
that doesn't mean we weren't all

170
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,560
affected when she spent the last few

171
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,390
days of her life helping out a damn Pig

172
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,700
it wouldn't be so bad except she talks

173
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,200
about her death like she's going out to

174
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,860
the store I'm done for Wilbur in a while

175
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,560
I would be dead oh well I guess that's

176
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,860
cool and as if that wasn't bad enough

177
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,710
she actually sings a song before she

178
00:08:55,710 --> 00:09:02,190
died oh you'd think oh now that's the

179
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:03,810
sign of a true hardworking entertainer

180
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,850
working behind the scenes never taking

181
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,650
the credit and leaving out a song what a

182
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:15,480
showman a show spider Charlotte

183
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:23,390
I'll never use a can of rain again

184
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:28,620
number three the funeral scene from

185
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,750
Michael after the success of home alone

186
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,610
Macaulay Culkin was America's hottest

187
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:34,140
child actor which is why it's so

188
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,060
shocking that any movie let alone kids

189
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,310
film had the balls to actually kill him

190
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:40,710
all this girl has a lot of grief to live

191
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,540
with not only is her only friend in the

192
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,550
entire world dead but she's the one that

193
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,320
knocked down the Beehive that caused him

194
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,970
to get stung to death it's because of

195
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:50,280
her moving that Culkin went back her dad

196
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,920
is the Undertaker of Culkin's body the

197
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,140
funeral is held at her house and she

198
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,670
finds out that the teacher she had a

199
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,890
crush on is getting married on the exact

200
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:02,370
same day she and I are gonna be married

201
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:06,810
this I don't know what medicine

202
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:08,250
they gave her to stop her from turning

203
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:27,770
into a psychopath number two

204
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:31,620
the death of Spock from Star Trek 2 okay

205
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,720
I know this is a bit of a stretch but

206
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,610
hey a lot of kids did watch Star Trek

207
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:37,980
back then and even if they didn't we all

208
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,140
knew who mr. Spock was the pointy eared

209
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,600
guy so when we saw him sacrifice his

210
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,430
life for the team you can rest assured

211
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:46,590
every Vulcan was crying green tears that

212
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:50,750
day everyone

213
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:55,250
Jasper rock on man the idea of killing

214
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,660
off a main character in the Star Trek

215
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,880
movie was unpredictable but the idea of

216
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,380
killing off mr. Spock

217
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,940
the most popular character on the show

218
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:04,160
that was just insane I mean

219
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,510
nobody saw that coming

220
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:07,310
now granted a lot of us know that he

221
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:09,170
comes back and the following sequels but

222
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:10,700
we didn't know that at the time we

223
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:11,840
thought he was really dead

224
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,640
especially one Kirk makes his big handy

225
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,920
speech at the end of all the souls I

226
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,430
have encountered in my travels his was

227
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:26,160
temples

228
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,879
marketable human

229
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:30,729
I'll bet - and to top it all off Scottie

230
00:11:30,729 --> 00:11:33,939
plays Amazing Grace on the bagpipes no

231
00:11:33,939 --> 00:11:36,759
less this is so corny and yet somehow so

232
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:44,920
freaking sad Oh

233
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:58,180
my deadhead comeback in Star Trek and

234
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:01,769
the number one sense nostalgic moment is

235
00:12:01,769 --> 00:12:04,750
every single God did a Disney movie ever

236
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,209
made I mean what the hell is wrong with

237
00:12:07,209 --> 00:12:09,610
this company in every other film someone

238
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:11,829
dies someone leaves someone's in a deep

239
00:12:11,829 --> 00:12:13,600
depression I thought this was supposed

240
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,639
to be Disney the happiest place on earth

241
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:18,519
happy like a bullet like remember this

242
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:28,560
happy moment how about this picker-upper

243
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,760
let's not forget this cheerful memory

244
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,139
Disney is always associated with family

245
00:12:35,139 --> 00:12:37,149
entertainment child-friendly fun but I

246
00:12:37,149 --> 00:12:38,800
think they hold the record for the most

247
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,010
crying scenes than any other studio

[Music]

249
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:47,100
Oh God I think the saddest moments are

250
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:52,830
probably the death of cymbals father the

251
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:56,120
kids of Old Yeller

252
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:02,910
and of course this scene is so famous

253
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:05,100
that people still talk about it even to

254
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,660
this day in fact there's a famous

255
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,820
Animaniacs episode that satirize this

256
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:15,300
emotional and crippling sea actually the

257
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:15,930
funny thing is

258
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:18,180
have you watched this scene recently I

259
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,190
mean okay you got the mother shot that

260
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:21,450
came looking for her and the father

261
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:23,730
saying your mother can't be with you

262
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:26,610
anymore but watch what comes immediately

263
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:31,830
after can you imagine they did that with

264
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:44,660
all their Disney films

somebody dies birds and flowers don't

00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,390
always pop up to make everything better

269
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:58,430
you have to deal with it like everyone

270
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:00,110
else in this cruel depressing

271
