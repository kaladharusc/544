00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:06,240
thank you to peanut butter chocolate blasted shreds for sponsoring today's episode. Wheat that woahs!

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,860
What if I told you only one truck has best in class towing?

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,360
I'd believe that.

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,380
WELL. Okay. Well,

5
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:18,660
Let me introduce to you the all-new

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,300
rugged

7
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,660
industrial-strength

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,020
model X-

9
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,640
Woah! That's so cool!

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,700
Right? This is the all-new super truck x-

11
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,460
Not the car, the wall!

12
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,550
How did you get that wall to slide open like that? It's like magic!

13
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:35,550
I..It's just on a track...

14
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:40,760
Woah!!!

15
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,530
Whisper...

16
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:45,320
Intense whisper...

17
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:50,150
Pensive whisper, but with pouted lips...

18
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:53,220
Final, meaningful, whisper...

19
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:59,660
Please buy what we're selling these commercials are very expensive

20
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:02,660
Bold.

21
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:05,340
Bolder.

22
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,640
Boldest!

23
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:13,200
Wait, how's this boldest? You're just eating a bowl of cereal.

24
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,900
But there's ROCKIN' music playing!

25
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,780
True..

26
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:23,300
Also, I set the building on FIRE!

27
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:27,680
*smoke detector beeping in the background* Heck yeah, BROTHER!

28
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,220
Woah!

29
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:32,620
Paint,

30
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,380
Rollers,

31
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,800
Brushes,

32
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,800
And a ladder.

33
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:42,200
Everything you need to bring a little color into your life.

34
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:47,760
Everything you want to make your home the way you want it.

35
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,000
The Home Store,

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,560
For all the projects you start and never finish!

37
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:05,940
Let's do this, but, y-you know. later.

38
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:11,209
Okay, wild bear, so what you're gonna do is take the competitors toilet paper and wipe it on your bottom

39
00:02:11,209 --> 00:02:15,320
So that little pieces get stuck in your fur. Okay, open the cage!

40
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,260
Oh- OH GOD! *screaming in background*

41
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,060
EVERYBODY RUN! AAA- AAA

42
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,100
OH WE SHOULD HAVE JUST ANIMATED THIS INSTEAD!

43
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:23,260
OH GOD!

44
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,820
This started as a place to make friends.

45
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:31,880
Then it got filled with annoying rants, clickbait, and spam from friends you barely see anymore.

46
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,100
And we're not sorry.

47
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,100
Because it made us super rich!

48
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:43,240
Social media. It's not good for you, but you can't quit!

49
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:50,140
The modern workout is extremely complex. So with that in mind we came up with an even more complex sports drink.

50
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:54,040
Introducing, our new 8 step hydration process.

51
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,060
Refresh

52
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,540
Revive

53
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,760
Cool down

54
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,180
Heat up

55
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,020
Warm in

56
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,120
Player: *screaming* Ah- OH! OW!

57
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,900
Cold out

58
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,880
Freeze

59
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:12,640
And finally, turn it into a powder and eat as much as you can on a spoon until you choke.

60
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,720
*Violent coughing*

61
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,340
Then you have to do it FOUR.MORE. TIMES.

62
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,820
WHAT?

63
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,080
Four?

64
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,500
Four more of those?

65
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,460
Super Fun Sports Drinkâ„¢. No matter what, you can never just have one.

66
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:30,500
Also, it's a lot easier and cheaper to just drink water.

67
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:36,380

00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,540

73
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,360

74
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:48,880
