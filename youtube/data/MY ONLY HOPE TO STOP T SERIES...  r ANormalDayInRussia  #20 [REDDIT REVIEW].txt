1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,110
This is not good enough

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:10,330
Okay t-series is taking over India is taking over the European Union approved the banning of millions

3
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:13,030
article 13 this meant for

4
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:17,250
Germany it's the Germans again, huh? I didn't want to make any kind of jokes like that

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:22,680
But this time they're back. I try to warn you guys first. They take our freedom then they take our meat

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:28,140
No, wait, whatever. You understand what you understand the stakes. I've had enough

7
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:33,809
Okay, that's the face you make when you troll the enemy, that's the face of pure evil right there. That's the top boss

8
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:35,790
I'm sorry, you have to tongue out like that

9
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:43,030
So, you know, it's so business what we need here is a country not affiliated with European

10
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:49,180
We need another country to mean what have we got Russia of course, yeah, you like that

11
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:56,219
Okay, let's go a normal day in Russia dealing with a parking spot dispute. I've seen this

12
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:06,610
I've never shared my show

13
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:15,040
Just saw that voting I mean that car

14
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:28,570
Nobody's saved what I like I was talking like it's

15
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:32,430
Taking matters in your own hand, you don't go and ban memes or anything like that

16
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:39,130
I like it a plus for the safety glasses when the guy behind you keeps hitting the chair. I

17
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:44,020
Love this so much at that moment Victor knew he had messed up big time

18
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:50,970
What happened to Victor? He tricked so random and like why? Is he on a bus Russia is so random guys

19
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:57,220
They just went on buses may imagine like a bot. You wouldn't see Obama or Trump or whatever on a bus like this

20
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:00,850
What's the content what happened to Victor?

21
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:04,830
Look at his friend is looking at like damn you did not just do that, Victor

22
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:18,340
You messed up big time boy. Even here. Take a seat

23
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,420
Hey

24
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:25,470
Perfect. Just realise when I was in Japan. We wrote a the subway a lie, and people kept falling asleep

25
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:29,459
It happened a couple times people would fall asleep on my shoulder and I was like, ah, that's cute

26
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:33,310
Now I realized they were just trying to get rid of me dad

27
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:39,730
Life hack, that's pretty good. See we have a lot that we can learn from Russia. Their way of dealing with problems is

28
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:41,890
A plus I gotta say very nice

29
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:48,810
When you have a car crash just entertain yourself build some snowmen, although if they were truly a progressive country

30
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:53,650
They would build snow when I guess some could you still have a way to go?

31
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:58,920
Mm-hmm. This can't be real. Why are there so many putin memes like what is he doing?

32
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:05,130
Hey, look, she's rockin the latest Gucci fashion. Look at her. Why is he always everywhere? How can you be so me mobile?

33
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:09,540
I understand that they just split the pictures around. Okay, I understand

34
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:16,440
This is Putin just normally licking his lollipop as you do and then he decided nicely to give it to the kid

35
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:23,500
Some jerk try to just switch them around but then you have the face of the kid and it's like what the heck? Oh

36
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:30,750
Look at that kids face is incredible. I really want to know what he see what did potent tell that child to make himself

37
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:36,370
I need a SOT moving on that face when Putin off for some tea

38
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:42,090
Why won't you have his tea pour potent no one wants his tea have some tea. No. Thanks

39
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:46,050
I wasn't asking his residue probably poisoned the tea, that could be it

40
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:52,360
They probably knew man like Putin always poisons the tea drink tea you guys

41
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:57,250
Opposition activists arrested while reporting live about arrests of

42
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:02,020
Opposition activists say they got a great sense of humor. That's hilarious

43
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:05,620
Look at the guy. He looks so sad. Oh, no

44
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:10,440
This is definitely not funny. But also very funny my favorite kind of humor

45
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:14,760
You're like you have you have something very upsetting, but you can still laugh at it

46
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:20,940
You have something upset upsetting and wrong with the world, but it still makes you chuckle and you move about with your day

47
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:28,470
That's the kind of jokes. I prefer analog ATM in Russia. See they got great banks. Look at that dude. He looks wonderful

48
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:33,840
Hey what some money no problem. Just give me your credit card number back in front. Okay, here you go

49
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:40,450
Here's a fiver on Russian television. They photoshopped the smile of King Yong Ying. That is it

50
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:42,030
Oh, well, okay

51
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:46,180
So this is the first picture and I see actual picture

52
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:55,810
They use one of those face fill tanks, you know where they give anyone a smile the phase app or whatever

53
00:04:55,810 --> 00:05:04,949
- Putin everywhere now. This is kind of freaking me out Russian watch done

54
00:05:04,949 --> 00:05:07,679
Whoa

55
00:05:07,679 --> 00:05:10,110
What

56
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:16,649
What is happening, why is it normal to have a Barris pet in Russia and Blanc is really in Russian?

57
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:21,649
Well, it looks like I'm not going to Russia then a normal day in president's life there

58
00:05:21,649 --> 00:05:25,439
There you go again. What does he do all day? He broke his arm

59
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:31,110
He's too bad old Putin memes. I swear to god he's writing a suicide note for him

60
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:36,990
Because he can't write with his left hand so thoughtful of him. So that is so

61
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:41,430
Wholesome guys smash like on this video. That is so nice

62
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:51,509
Last famine sandy wait, there's women in russia

63
00:05:51,509 --> 00:05:59,850
Less than how well, oh my god

64
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:09,480
All right

65
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,330
Summary in Russia

66
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:17,240
Why is everyone in Russia wearing the latest Gucci collection, I don't understand how can they afford it?

67
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:23,160
All right. Don't make me feel for people too much. Let's move on

68
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:28,200
So stupid why don't we laugh at these Russian TV everybody?

69
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:35,460
well, at least I don't have any ads take a Hollywood in Russia who says Russia is not high-class like the

70
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:42,390
California leaves look at that. I can't tell the difference. Don't you take my parking spot? Ok?

71
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:43,710
8:35

72
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:44,790
9:30

73
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:49,950
You could have just moved the bike. Why move the bike when you can throw it up a tree yay

74
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:55,010
All right note to self don't ever make a wrong parking in Russia. Got it. Ok

75
00:06:55,010 --> 00:07:09,320
What's the name of this country what I've seen this?

76
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,500
My favorite it's the guy on the lower left who's

77
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:18,700
Only angry and wants to fight the guy crew in the hill then his buddy comes like no kidding. They're fine

78
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:25,100
Come on to you there. Okay, let's keep hanging out in the container kiddo

79
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:30,950
We're having a good time Kira come on, we're doing the slug dance. Is that a real wedding photo?

80
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:34,880
This is some indian level photoshop, man. Damn

81
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:40,880
She looks so happy about the marriage has anyone ever smile in a photo in Russia?

82
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:47,170
You just got to get the phase that that's how the only way whenever there's in a smiling in Russian photos, you know

83
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:53,120
They use Photoshop Stadium in Russia. Didn't need to be fun : vacation for the World Cup. So they added

84
00:07:53,120 --> 00:08:03,590
18,000 seats in the most terrifying way possible. Do you see anything from this seat Oh what you dude you do? Okay. Well

85
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:07,490
Belarus ever anyone Russia will arrest your trash

86
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:12,640
Recycling. It's a subversive capitalist plot. If you pee we'll put you on YouTube

87
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:20,330
Wait some Russians actually fear this before you're allowed in the tank. You have to prove you're blind trust in it. No

88
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:22,160
No

89
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:28,670
whoa, just imagine the cannon just firing the the candidates they

90
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:35,050
Finish them off. They mastered the fashion game. No one can deny it. Well, that's enough Fiat for me for today

91
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:39,710
Check out the merch guys. Just kidding. You can't we sold out

92
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:43,000
Keep subscribing. We need to destroy India

93
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,120
And that's it for me for now leave like and enjoyed this video and I'll see you guys tomorrow

94
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,070
Get out and now a word from our sponsor if anyone

95
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:57,520
Comments negatively about my camera setup. You will 100% be banned

96
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:04,580
Yeah, it's time for me to flex on your kids. Very nice. I have the honor play and the new honor of 10

97
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,720
Very nice

98
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:13,879
Thank you honor for sponsoring this video I of course already have the old one and look at this by the way music my queen

99
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:15,230
my king

100
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:23,300
Very nice, but it's time for me to utter brain because now I have the honor play everybody. Let's start by unboxing the honor play

101
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:27,230
Unboxing time smash like if you like unboxing

102
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:31,060
Well, I guess here it is already. We didn't even have to unbox it

103
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:37,819
How about that now what's special about the other play is new? Well many things but it's optimized for

104
00:09:37,819 --> 00:09:43,579
Gaming so it's got GPU turbo which basically means improved graphics performance

105
00:09:43,579 --> 00:09:46,399
increasing efficiency with 60%

106
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:53,139
Damn, Daniel, basically while you're playing video games. You'll get a stable performance. No lag

107
00:09:53,139 --> 00:09:57,610
No BS it also has an amazing battery on my old one is already amazing

108
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:00,879
Like I feel like I rarely even have to charge it

109
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:04,269
So if they've improved on that even more that that's not bad son

110
00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:11,420
You can apparently stream 15 hours of video on this you can watch 15 hours of PewDiePie on this

111
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:14,930
Ok, if that's not epic. I don't know. What is

112
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:16,759
95 hours of music

113
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:22,699
You can even watch if you use the ultra power saving mode by honors power saving technology

114
00:10:22,699 --> 00:10:28,209
A full season of Rick and Morty or your favorite TV show doesn't have to be written Maury

115
00:10:28,209 --> 00:10:35,420
I just assumed it was written morning in one charge. I forgot to mention that otherwise it wouldn't be that impressive

116
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:40,610
So the graphics processing quality is higher frame rate lower jitter

117
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:46,300
So you'll be able to play games like pub G they have 3d surround sound and smart shock

118
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:52,939
so if you get shot anywhere the phone will vibrate in their direction of their bullets and you'll be able to

119
00:10:52,939 --> 00:10:55,730
Distinctively that's a tough word for me apparently

120
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:58,490
Be able to hear where the shots are coming from

121
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:02,389
Which obviously if you're playing a game like pub G or any competitive game on your phone?

122
00:11:02,389 --> 00:11:07,370
That's a must so you'll have a major advantage with a phone like the honor play

123
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:12,110
So I haven't tried out the camera, but it's supposed to have AI technology

124
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:18,660
Recognizes 500 more and more scenarios since the settings based on it. Damn. I look good

125
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:24,930
Damn, I look good. It also has a are lens. Oh

126
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:29,010
Yeah

127
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:32,910
This changes everything

128
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:38,250
How I eat it, oh man has a lot of them hey guys, I'm just in London I

129
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:41,940
Also have to show you my honor 10. Damn

130
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:49,399
Can you see their reflections? It's not lit enough. Damn it. It's super cool. It looks amazing. I love the look of this phone

131
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:52,860
So this one is very similar to the honor play very eye-catching

132
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:58,380
Very nice and looking so this one has GPU turbo as well now to show you

133
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:04,550
The power of Flex tape and the power of the honor. We're gonna do a dent benchmark test, okay

134
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:08,070
This is that big so let's let's cut to that

135
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:14,089
Okay, here's a benchmark test between honor play one plus six and Samsung S nine

136
00:12:14,089 --> 00:12:20,430
plus, these are the settings that we used and we write a MOBA game on it and as you can see

137
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:26,519
Honored place stays at 60 frames per second steady while on one plus six and Samsung against nine

138
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:29,760
Is going all over the place, which means you will get

139
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,959
Starting and lag while playing a game which you especially don't want

140
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:39,390
So here you can see the result 100% stability and honor plays version 90% in 1 plus
