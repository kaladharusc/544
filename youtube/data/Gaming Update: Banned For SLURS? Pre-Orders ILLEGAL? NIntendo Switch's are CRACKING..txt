1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,770
what's up ladies and gentlemen of

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:03,120
YouTube's book 80 to 90 day coming at

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,560
you lavas again through the power of the

4
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:05,730
Internet and this is my weekly gaming

5
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:07,470
news series which I haven't done for

6
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:08,580
about a month

7
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,559
hey but better late than never we got

8
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:11,519
some really interesting stuff to talk

9
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:12,870
about this week so let's just get right

10
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:14,519
into it so first story here I want to

11
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:15,660
talk a little bit about Rainbow six

12
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,279
siege which is run by the folks over

13
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,140
there at Ubisoft

14
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,670
they've decided to join some other

15
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:21,900
companies you know the folks over at

16
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:22,590
overwatch

17
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,210
the folks over Microsoft her taking a

18
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,910
very hard line stance when it comes to

19
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,240
racial slurs homophobic slurs stuff like

20
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,219
that along along those lines in their

21
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:33,870
games now the way this currently works

22
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:35,940
in Rainbow six siege if you type in you

23
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,100
know certain words certain slurs into

24
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,170
the text chat there's not really much

25
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,280
there doing about it I think of her

26
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,870
voice chat right now but you type some

27
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,520
one of those things in the text chat you

28
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,800
are banned immediately and then it's a

29
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,329
very short ban I think it's for 30

30
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:50,280
minutes the first time the second time

31
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,660
it's for longer the third time

32
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,610
eventually there is a manual review and

33
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:54,660
then they determine whether or not

34
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,430
they're gonna ban your account forever

35
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,770
when that happens so but right now as it

36
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:00,690
is if you just type in you know certain

37
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:01,920
words you're gonna get banned

38
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,750
immediately and it's gonna keep you from

39
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:04,830
playing the game for about half an hour

40
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:06,450
so of course people taking to Twitter to

41
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:08,189
complain about this and a lot of them

42
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:10,260
have like added the official Rainbow six

43
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,210
siege Twitter account and they are

44
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:13,619
having none of it you know you see

45
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:15,030
people saying like I can't believe I got

46
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,009
banned and the Twitter account was

47
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:18,600
official Twitter accounts responding

48
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,630
with stuff like good don't be an asshole

49
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:22,799
so they definitely picked a side here

50
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,030
they definitely decided what they want

51
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,350
to do and this is what they want to do

52
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,479
here's the thing Ubisoft is definitely

53
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:29,070
not alone when it comes to this because

54
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:31,200
we see folks like Microsoft say that

55
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,790
very soon they will not tolerate that

56
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,860
kind of thing anywhere on any of their

57
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,869
services starting in text but eventually

58
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:38,189
they want to look at how to get it out

59
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:40,350
of the audio chat as well and we've got

60
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,670
the folks over at overwatch have been

61
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,290
fighting this fight for a couple of

62
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:44,549
years so this seems to be the direction

63
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:46,770
that gaming is moving in this is seems

64
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:47,850
to be the direction that games as a

65
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,470
service is going to move in and it looks

66
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:50,250
like you know the folks of world

67
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,750
Warcraft have been doing this forever as

68
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,670
well so I'm really curious this is what

69
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,350
you think about this I'd like to know

70
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,520
your opinion in the comments section

71
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,380
personally it's not going to affect me

72
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,250
because I don't use that kind of

73
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,899
language when playing video games we're

74
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:02,189
not playing video games so it's not

75
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:03,990
going to affect me one way or the other

76
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:04,979
but there are a lot of people who are

77
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:06,630
saying what a freedom of speech freedom

78
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,369
of speech and you still have freedom of

79
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:09,780
speech the government is not going to

80
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,950
prevent you from doing these types of

81
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:11,310
things

82
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,440
Ubisoft though Microsoft these companies

83
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:13,910
have a choice

84
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:14,840
whether or not they're gonna let you do

85
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,060
that on their private servers which they

86
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,670
below they own and so you know I mean

87
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:20,960
you still have the freedom to go create

88
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,910
your own competing game and then say

89
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,740
whatever nasty stuff you want to say on

90
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,840
that game or find a game that will let

91
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,610
you say that stuff if you want now this

92
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,080
week's episode is sponsored by the folks

93
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,720
over at Nord VPN which is the VPN I've

94
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,280
been using for about a year and it's the

95
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,680
only VPN I will use as you guys know

96
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,630
from previous sponsorships I use Nord

97
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:41,120
VPN on my iPad on my phone just to

98
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,650
protect myself whenever I connect to

99
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:45,230
Wi-Fi publicly that way my accounts and

100
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:46,670
my everything else is secure and safe I

101
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:47,780
don't want to so to get my youtube

102
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:48,740
password I don't want to go to my

103
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,000
banking account information

104
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,890
I want to stay safe and secure when I'm

105
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:53,630
connecting to Wi-Fi but actually started

106
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:56,420
using Nord VPN at home as well and I do

107
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,370
like the extra security but it's mostly

108
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:00,140
because net neutrality being gone I

109
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,330
don't want my ISP collecting data on

110
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:03,980
what I'm using I don't want them paying

111
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,540
attention to what I'm connecting to and

112
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:06,800
it doesn't matter I'm just watching

113
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,320
Netflix or watching YouTube or doing my

114
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,390
work here for this job or file-sharing

115
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:12,770
or whatever it is I don't want them

116
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:14,420
collecting that data I don't want them

117
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:15,830
using it against me I don't want them

118
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,360
selling it to the highest bidder so I'm

119
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,890
using north VPN because when I use it

120
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:20,540
the only thing though they know is I'm

121
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,130
connecting to an Ord server and then

122
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:23,780
Nord servers connecting to me and that's

123
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:27,110
it when you go to north VPN comm /bo OG

124
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:30,890
IE and use coupon code be oo gie it

125
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:32,450
comes out to two dollars and seventy

126
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:34,790
five cents a month that's a seventy

127
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:36,860
seven percent discount on the three-year

128
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:39,650
deal I highly highly recommend it and I

129
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:40,790
do want to make it very clear that while

130
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:42,650
I am sponsored by Nord I also used the

131
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:44,780
service every single day to keep me safe

132
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,610
to protect me whether I'm Cherie files

133
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:48,290
or playing video games are connecting to

134
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:50,000
Wi-Fi and I recommend that because they

135
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,930
have over 4,200 different servers across

136
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:55,790
62 different countries and they're the

137
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:58,910
only VPN to get a perfect score by PC

138
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,739
Magazine so you can trust me want to

139
00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:02,780
tell you they are the best so this is my

140
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,250
Nintendo switch and you guys have

141
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,260
noticed quite a bit in the past whenever

142
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,640
I show this often video that there are a

143
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,860
few cracks around the screws and even

144
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:12,410
some missing plastic and some melting

145
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:15,290
there near the hinges and I gotta say I

146
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:17,000
thought this is because I was very very

147
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,130
rough on the system but it looks like a

148
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:20,330
lot of other people are having that

149
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:21,500
problem with a Nintendo switch as well

150
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,030
about a month ago people started

151
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,050
complaining that they were noticing

152
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,940
cracks around their Nintendo switch and

153
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,240
they thought it was just their unit

154
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,650
but once everybody started comparing it

155
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,120
it looks like a large number of units

156
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,310
have cracks near the heating area near

157
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:34,860
the event systems near the screws things

158
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,270
along that lines and it's led a lot of

159
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,289
people to believe that it's just a

160
00:04:37,289 --> 00:04:39,090
manufacturer's defect now we already

161
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:40,889
know that the Nintendo switch runs hot

162
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:42,780
if you've ever played one with a

163
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,310
handheld mode for a while or you ever

164
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:45,599
picked one up from the dock you know how

165
00:04:45,599 --> 00:04:47,370
hot the unit can get we do know that

166
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,440
heat can warp the system and a lot of

167
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,300
systems will get a curve to them so if

168
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,069
it's got heat issues enough to melt the

169
00:04:53,069 --> 00:04:54,720
thing to warp it a little bit then it

170
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,580
only stands to reason that can also make

171
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,500
it hot enough to melt the plastic and

172
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,550
that seems to be what a lot of people

173
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,349
think is happening in some websites are

174
00:05:01,349 --> 00:05:02,699
actually reporting that one in five

175
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:04,650
Nintendo switch owners that have been

176
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,150
polled say that they have those cracks

177
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:07,889
on their systems so it seems to be a

178
00:05:07,889 --> 00:05:09,690
fairly widespread problem Nintendo

179
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:11,909
doesn't seem to think so yet though the

180
00:05:11,909 --> 00:05:13,139
only official statement we have is from

181
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:14,520
Nintendo Europe who said it's not a

182
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,900
widespread problem it's since it's not a

183
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,610
widespread problem they're not gonna be

184
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,919
fixing it on their dime if you do want

185
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,360
to get it fixed you can get it fixed

186
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,979
someone on YouTube said it cost as much

187
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:24,720
as two hundred and forty dollars to get

188
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,940
it fixed which is almost the price of a

189
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,409
brand new switch so I don't know why you

190
00:05:28,409 --> 00:05:30,389
wouldn't just buy a brand new switch

191
00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:32,250
because you get the dock and you get the

192
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,930
you get the joy cause and everything

193
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,610
else with it but it looks like Nintendo

194
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:36,960
isn't recognizing this as a

195
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,990
manufacturer's defect yet the good news

196
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:41,400
is if you do have those kinds of cracks

197
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,930
or the melting around the heat vents or

198
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:44,250
something along that lines let me know

199
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,419
in the comment section below because I'd

200
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:46,710
love to hear from you but you should

201
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:48,419
also let Nintendo know because the more

202
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:49,979
of us that call in I've called in to let

203
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:51,389
them know that I have that problem the

204
00:05:51,389 --> 00:05:52,979
bar was a call in the more likely they

205
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:55,080
are to fix it for free as they showed

206
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,370
one more story about the new thinnest

207
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:57,960
which if you are looking to hack a

208
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,880
Nintendo switch just know that they're

209
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,130
starting to push hack resistant units

210
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:03,300
out on the shelves they've shown up in

211
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,280
Japan they do not have the boot ROM

212
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,900
problem that the other ones do so you

213
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,190
should probably buy a Nintendo system

214
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:10,590
soon if you want to have one that's

215
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:12,569
eventually exploitable and hackable and

216
00:06:12,569 --> 00:06:14,069
it's better that you don't patch it via

217
00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:15,210
software because it's going to make it

218
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:17,370
much more complicated to be able to do

219
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:18,990
homebrew and stuff on it but sort of let

220
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:20,460
you guys know that that's definitely an

221
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,630
issue they've definitely fixed that they

222
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,460
found a way to fix it in the hardware so

223
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,500
if you buy a new system soon you won't

224
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,270
be able to do that buy an older system

225
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:28,919
and buy it soon now you may not have

226
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:30,539
heard about this but there's one more

227
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:32,460
Nintendo store here for you the folks

228
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,440
over Nintendo have basically less

229
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,589
splatoon to to be a cheaters paradise

230
00:06:37,589 --> 00:06:39,630
now you play that game you've definitely

231
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,010
run into cheaters at some point

232
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:42,420
and if you've been losing a lot more

233
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,770
than you think it's because a lot of

234
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,210
people have hacked a Nintendo switch and

235
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:46,740
they're using it to cheat and there's

236
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,470
currently no anti cheat system in place

237
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:51,870
so one desperate user did their best to

238
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,430
try to get a Nintendo's attention and

239
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:55,170
point out how badly they need an anti

240
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:57,390
cheat by messing with the scoreboards

241
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,740
and this is if you see it here on your

242
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,120
screen right now this is what they did

243
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,640
they made the top four slot spell out

244
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,460
please add anti cheat and of course

245
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,980
Nintendo responded almost exactly the

246
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,330
way you think they will go ahead and say

247
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:10,290
it out loud with me

248
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:13,020
they banned this user and there's still

249
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,150
no anti cheat and no word about whether

250
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:17,190
or not they're going to add anti cheat

251
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:19,680
to splatoon too so dinner was just a

252
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,210
company that's not really ready for the

253
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:23,160
online world just yet I feel like and

254
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,170
this is definitely a perfect example of

255
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:25,590
that

256
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:27,090
everyone in Tendo fans out there by the

257
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,860
way you know I love my switch you know I

258
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,170
love Nintendo but let's be honest you

259
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:32,880
guys know you're gonna lose your mind if

260
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,860
there is not anti cheat for Smash

261
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,330
Brothers online people are gonna lose

262
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,770
their minds that that game turns out to

263
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:40,290
be broken so they better get this stuff

264
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:41,820
figured out by then these are

265
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,560
interesting news about pre-orders coming

266
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,730
out of Germany and you guys know how I

267
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,740
feel about pre-orders in general digital

268
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,450
pre-orders don't make very much sense to

269
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:50,460
me you should always wait for the

270
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,320
reviews I guess if you need to download

271
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,180
it earlier that makes sense physical

272
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,500
pre-orders don't make that much more

273
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,240
sense to me either occasionally if

274
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,560
you're getting a collector's edition if

275
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,940
you're getting a physical item and it's

276
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,770
the only way to get it maybe that's fine

277
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:04,110
even for digital in-game goods unless

278
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,940
it's a very significant thing and it

279
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,830
never should be you shouldn't be

280
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,690
pre-ordering digital or physical copies

281
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,100
anymore because there's no scarcity

282
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,410
issues to worry about it's just you kind

283
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,180
of just wasting your money for a period

284
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,740
of time I guess it does serve as a bit

285
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,210
of a savings Club for some people if you

286
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:19,650
have trouble saving money and that makes

287
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:21,630
sense but you should always wait for the

288
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:23,250
review before you cash in that pre-order

289
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,960
if you have that option and not

290
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,400
everybody lets you have that option when

291
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,360
your pre-order games especially

292
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,070
digitally but there are definitely

293
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:30,840
companies like Game Stop who can take

294
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,030
advantage of the entire pre-order system

295
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,740
they'll take pre-orders for games that

296
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,210
have been announced that don't have

297
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:38,640
release dates or firm release dates or

298
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,870
games that are perpetually delayed

299
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,669
there's a that one story running around

300
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:43,500
about a guy who had a Duke Nukem Forever

301
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,900
pre-order that was literally forever ago

302
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,130
and then when the game finally did come

303
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:49,680
out Game Stop would not honor it because

304
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,050
it was almost 15-20 years old so I did

305
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:53,460
you know folks like that have been a

306
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,900
real issue and the folks at Germany

307
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,670
have decided that they are done with

308
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,530
that and if a game does not have a firm

309
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:00,870
release date you cannot sell pre-orders

310
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,790
for that game and I think it's a good

311
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,920
president I think that's a good way to

312
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,360
go and I hopefully will start seeing

313
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,680
that elsewhere if you don't have a firm

314
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,390
release date you shouldn't be able to

315
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:11,280
collect pre-orders on that game now it

316
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,990
does look like the way the law is going

317
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,730
to be written this has got an easy

318
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:16,440
loophole you can always release the game

319
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,450
earlier than expected but not later than

320
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:19,860
expected you can change to the release

321
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:23,070
date closer but not further away so it

322
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:24,120
looks like they'll just be able to put a

323
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,570
release date of say 2099 has the release

324
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:28,920
date and then you know put a much more

325
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,350
realistic release date when the time

326
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:33,240
comes I still collect pre-orders it's

327
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:33,990
still a step in the right direction

328
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,790
though but that leads me to a question

329
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,230
that I want you guys to answer in the

330
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:39,480
comments section why if ever do you

331
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,100
preorder a games now I will definitely

332
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,570
preorder a collector's edition from time

333
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:44,190
to time knowing that I can physically

334
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:46,230
return that or that I can probably sell

335
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:47,610
it for more than it was that I paid for

336
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:48,090
it

337
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:50,190
when the game comes out even if they've

338
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,960
reviews turned out to be good digitally

339
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,120
I will pre download and preorder a game

340
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,400
24 hours before it comes out once I've

341
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,840
seen the reviews or once I've talked to

342
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,430
somebody who's played it and very rarely

343
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:01,530
if I play a game at a show and I know

344
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:02,970
that it's good or I've got to play the

345
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,380
demo and I know that it's going to be

346
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,480
good I will take a chance there but if

347
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,520
beyond those circumstances when do you

348
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,620
preorder a game and and why and that's

349
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,850
gonna do it for this episode I hope you

travel season and now the broken arm I

355
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,680
feel like I've been wanting to skip it

356

357
