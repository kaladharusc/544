1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,069
mommy did say daddy needs to drink

2
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,480

these are the guys that directed the movie nerve

7
00:00:32,329 --> 00:00:36,199
so this hotel is where their press junket is it's happening one flight down

8
00:00:36,199 --> 00:00:40,940
and I guess the plan for today is just to mess with the actors and actress that

9
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,829
are in this movie and then best with the press

10
00:00:42,829 --> 00:00:46,129

16
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:09,820

17
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,580
use this microphone here and tell them what to say

18
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:16,300
