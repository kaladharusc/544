00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,650
what's up ladies and gentlemen of

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:03,330
YouTube boogie2988 coming at your level

3
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:04,890
to get through the power of the Internet

4
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:06,299
and currently at the time this video is

5
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:10,019
being recorded Blizzcon 2018 is going up

6
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:13,320
and this Blizzcon marks something I've

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,639
never seen before

8
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,550
blizzard getting booed on their own

9
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,130
stage at their own convention by their

10
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:21,449
fans let me show you what I'm talking

11
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:21,660
about

12
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,470
the current plan is to be on mobile both

13
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:29,789
Android and iOS we don't have any plans

14
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:39,989
at moment to do PC it over oh oh my god

15
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:41,280
that was hard to watch how they

16
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,980
responded to that is very telling though

17
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,620
watch this did you guys not have phones

18
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,640
yeah you guys to play your tablet - yes

19
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,800
I do have a phone but it doesn't mean I

20
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,570
want to play the next yeah blow game on

21
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,550
this tiny screen using touchscreen

22
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:59,760
controls and gamers are as usual showing

23
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,320
their displeasure and one of the most

24
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,940
visible ways that they can look at the

25
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,890
diablo immortal cinematic trailer with

26
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:08,790
1.3 million views on this 282,000

27
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:10,439
dislikes and there's been some

28
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:12,390
shenanigans here of them setting the

29
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:14,310
original thing to private and re

30
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,900
uploading and doing all kinds of stuff

31
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,340
to try to get rid of those dislikes and

32
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,920
ain't helping so announcing this diablo

33
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,229
mobile game has gone over like a lead

34
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:23,909
balloon and i've heard all kinds of

35
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:25,820
crazy different reasons as to why

36
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:28,470
entitled gamers just demanding things

37
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:31,229
they don't like and and people saying

38
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:33,299
that it's because of a sahjhan e because

39
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:35,759
the the mobile market is primarily

40
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,680
female dominated them and Mel

41
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,750
gatekeepers don't want their game on a

42
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,460
mobile device because women might play

43
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,829
all kinds of crazy ideas I want to break

44
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:45,180
some of that stuff down today so if you

45
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,290
look context for those of you don't know

46
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:47,700
Blizzard holds an event every year

47
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,590
called Blizzcon and it takes place in

48
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,509
Anaheim California and the tickets are

49
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:52,920
very expensive and you can buy digital

50
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,140
tickets to hear all of this great

51
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,640
diablo news and you get some cool

52
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,530
special in-game items and you can get

53
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,570
some special loot at the stores and the

54
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,340
boost there and there's a nice big

55
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,250
concert it's a celebration of everything

56
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,509
blizzard and somebody that shows up at

57
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:08,910
Blizzcon is likely a big fan of the

58
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,890
company and likes anything that Blizzard

59
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:12,930
is going to do so the fact that our

60
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:13,860
audience members

61
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,260
booing this product should show you how

62
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,470
very little the installed playerbase for

63
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:22,140
a Diablo game or a blizzard fan would

64
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,540
want a Diablo mobile game but the

65
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,130
problem goes way deeper than that for

66
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:27,990
those you don't truly understand it the

67
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,190
most obvious problem here that people

68
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,810
seem to be glaring over is that the

69
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:32,880
Diablo franchise is horribly popular

70
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,740
selling hundreds of millions of copies

71
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:38,220
of the PC versions of the game and that

72
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,630
means it's historically always been

73
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:42,450
played with mouse and keyboard so in a

74
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,700
franchised fan who's used to the series

75
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,780
who's been looking forward to the next

76
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,570
game who would attend Blizzcon obviously

77
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:50,370
is not going to be excited about him

78
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,050
moving to a small screen instead of a

79
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:53,700
nice big monitor instead of playing with

80
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,989
the mouse and keyboard you have to play

81
00:02:54,989 --> 00:02:57,959
it with a touchscreen and keep in mind

82
00:02:57,959 --> 00:02:59,340
this is not only just a small screen but

83
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,660
your fingers are gonna be in the way

84
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,480
I'll be able to see what's going on the

85
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,070
hablÃ³ is historically a very deep

86
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:07,170
franchise with very deep mechanics when

87
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:08,910
you put it on a phone you're going to

88
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,380
have to get rid of a lot of that depth

89
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,450
now the counterpoint there is to say

90
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,489
that number one a lot of games have made

91
00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:16,050
it to phones you've got your fortnight's

92
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:18,330
you've got your pub jeez other high-end

93
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:20,310
games and now that phones are capable of

94
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,989
running games like that it is entirely

95
00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:24,120
possible we can get a game as deep as

96
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,540
pub G or fortnight on the phone the

97
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,370
Diablo is always way deeper than that

98
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,230
but well let's ignore that for now

99
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:32,790
another counter point is that there are

100
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:34,290
millions of people who have never played

101
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,660
a Diablo game who only play games on

102
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,489
their phone and that's kind of cool so

103
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:40,380
there is a chance that people will find

104
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,090
Diablo through their phone through the

105
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,950
mobile version of the game and then move

106
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:45,720
to Diablo 4 when it finally launches

107
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,610
giving it a much bigger player base that

108
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,410
I think is a fairly valid point one

109
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:50,700
argument that I've heard though is that

110
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,190
mobile gaming is primarily dominated by

111
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,799
female players and one of the reasons we

112
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:58,470
men are upset about a Diablo mobile game

113
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:00,120
is that it's going to open the franchise

114
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,209
to female players and I completely

115
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:05,250
completely reject that idea almost every

116
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,560
female gamer I know and I know hundreds

117
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,019
through YouTube much less dozens in my

118
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:12,299
personal life they have all played the

119
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:14,220
Diablo franchise some of them only

120
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,720
played it on console but the mass

121
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,109
majority of them played it on PC so I I

122
00:04:19,109 --> 00:04:21,150
don't I don't have a problem and I don't

123
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:23,700
think any sane logical person has a

124
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,210
problem with a female gamer playing

125
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:27,690
Diablo you

126
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:29,790
it's the worst kind of straw Manning and

127
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:31,920
I just I reject it I absolutely reject

128
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,870
it the second biggest argument I have

129
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,970
against a diablo mobile game is how they

130
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:37,830
are going to monetize it is this going

131
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:40,650
to be a $60 game on a phone probably not

132
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,750
will it be a $30 game on a phone

133
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,940
probably not will it be free to download

134
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,550
and monetize with microtransactions

135
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:49,980
most likely because that's the mobile

136
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,360
market and I think that's something a

137
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,520
lot of us are rejecting right off the

138
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,780
bat we're afraid that they're going to

139
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,000
monetize this similar the way Activision

140
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,470
has now monetized some of their other

141
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:00,990
games such as World of Warcraft having

142
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:03,420
in-game pets or Diablo 3 do you remember

143
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:06,000
the entire fiasco with Diablo 3 come on

144
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,010
you have to remember the auction house

145
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:10,140
in Diablo 3 if you've never been a fan

146
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,340
of the Diablo franchise one of the

147
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,740
biggest draws is the wide variety of

148
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,330
items that you can get and collecting

149
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:17,010
items sets and collecting a variety of

150
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:18,480
items and getting all of the legendaries

151
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,890
and getting all of the really cool stuff

152
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:21,900
that alters the game and the way that

153
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,120
you play your class and nobody ever

154
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,040
wants to see that monetized we didn't

155
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,170
want to see it monetized in Diablo 3 we

156
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:29,640
definitely do not want to see it

157
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,370
monetized in a mobile game we just want

158
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:34,140
to be able to buy the game and play the

159
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,330
game for one price I think that's a very

160
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:38,400
fair and reasonable argument to make now

161
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,690
the counter point of this is we still

162
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:41,010
don't know how they're gonna monetize

163
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:42,030
this game we don't know what they're

164
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:43,919
going to sell it for we really don't

165
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,930
have an understanding of that yet most

166
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:47,250
people are banking on the fact that

167
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,390
they're probably going to do it like

168
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,970
every other mobile game has ever done it

169
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:53,790
but they might surprise us here and I

170
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,620
will wait to see if they do the third

171
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,940
biggest issue I'm seeing right now is a

172
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,250
lot of fans are saying that this game is

173
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,410
not a completely unique game it is

174
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:03,330
actually just a reskin of an existing

175
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:06,030
Korean game called Crusaders of light so

176
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,830
the Diablo mobile game is being made by

177
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,810
a company called net ease and that ease

178
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,820
makes another game very similar to it

179
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,500
called Crusaders of light when you do a

180
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,960
side-by-side comparison

181
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,030
especially the UI for the game it looks

182
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:21,900
very very similar so it seems to me that

183
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,370
there's a reason to presume this as

184
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:25,560
possible I mean look at this look at

185
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,510
this trailer for this game and then

186
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:30,030
compare it to the Diablo footage you're

187
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:31,230
gonna see some real similarities there

188
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:32,550
oh boy

189
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:34,200
now the counter to that is that Reese

190
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,260
kids are not inherently bad Mario - in

191
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,270
the West is actually a reskin of a

192
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,740
completely different

193
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,930
with the Mario mechanics shoved into it

194
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:45,030
so it's fair to say that it's possible

195
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,190
to reskin a game and then make some

196
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:49,110
changes and enhancement to it that makes

197
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:51,360
it that franchises game I could see that

198
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,009
as possible but here's the thing if

199
00:06:53,009 --> 00:06:54,840
Nettie's made Crusaders of light and it

200
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,460
looks very similar to the new Diablo

201
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,289
game then we can presume they will build

202
00:06:58,289 --> 00:07:00,599
it very similar to Crusaders of light

203
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:02,130
and we would see look at the reviews of

204
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,169
Crusaders of light things do not bode

205
00:07:04,169 --> 00:07:06,120
well for the new Diablo game the reviews

206
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,009
for Crusaders of light say that it's

207
00:07:08,009 --> 00:07:10,169
poorly coded that it has a tap to let

208
00:07:10,169 --> 00:07:12,090
you let the game play itself for you

209
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:15,300
function that it is paid to win and that

210
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,669
it's just overall poorly coded and just

211
00:07:17,669 --> 00:07:20,220
not a very good game so here's the thing

212
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,690
if Blizzard had built this game from the

213
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:24,389
ground up I might still be on board I

214
00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:26,400
would be holding out some sort of hope

215
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,110
that they were creating some game

216
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:30,690
changing world altering mobile changing

217
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:34,259
experience on the mobile platform but I

218
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:35,789
sincerely don't think that's the case

219
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,319
since they outsource Nettie's who'd

220
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:39,240
already made one pay to win game I get a

221
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,400
feeling this is going to be just more of

222
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,380
the same and then finally the biggest

223
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,060
argument I've seen levied against

224
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,219
outspoken gaming commentators and

225
00:07:47,219 --> 00:07:49,830
critics and gamers at Blizzcon is saying

226
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:52,590
look this game simply isn't for you so

227
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:54,870
you simply just don't have to play it

228
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:56,669
why are you complaining why are you

229
00:07:56,669 --> 00:07:59,070
disliking YouTube videos why are you so

230
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:01,500
mad are you an untitled gamer are you a

231
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,349
misogynist what's your issue and I think

232
00:08:04,349 --> 00:08:06,000
that comes from a basic misunderstanding

233
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,780
of the fact that Diablo is a franchise

234
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,699
game and if you've never been in

235
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:15,210
franchised in a franchised game let me

236
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:16,979
try to explain it to you imagine your

237
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:18,930
favorite television series let's go with

238
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:20,969
Breaking Bad and imagine that you're on

239
00:08:20,969 --> 00:08:23,400
season 3 of Breaking Bad and you're just

240
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,020
now beginning to really fall in love

241
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,400
with all of the characters and learning

242
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,620
how to hate Walter White and then they

243
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,080
announced that season for all of

244
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,270
Breaking Bad is not going to be a

245
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:35,579
television show instead it's going to be

246
00:08:35,579 --> 00:08:37,680
a web series broken up in five-minute

247
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,140
segments and you have to pay a buck 99

248
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:43,770
to watch each segment of the show that

249
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:44,820
would be a little upsetting wouldn't it

250
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,320
no obviously that's a false equivalency

251
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,570
but I grew up playing Diablo and I

252
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:51,150
wanted to play more Diablo I wanted a

253
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,829
new Diablo game to come out soon I've

254
00:08:52,829 --> 00:08:53,779
been looking forward

255
00:08:53,779 --> 00:08:56,389
to Diablo 4 for quite some time really

256
00:08:56,389 --> 00:08:58,579
ever since the hablo 3 came out because

257
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:00,499
that game was a disappointment so I'm

258
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:03,079
still waiting for the next piece of the

259
00:09:03,079 --> 00:09:04,879
franchise I'm still waiting for the next

260
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:07,699
season of my Breaking Bad and yes you

261
00:09:07,699 --> 00:09:10,009
are damned right in the fact that I want

262
00:09:10,009 --> 00:09:12,439
the next installment of my franchise my

263
00:09:12,439 --> 00:09:14,540
beloved franchise to at least be

264
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,999
playable on the same platform that I

265
00:09:16,999 --> 00:09:19,670
played it on my entire life on top of

266
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:20,870
that it would be kind of nice if it

267
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,910
played and looked like and felt like

268
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:25,220
fairly similar to the previous games in

269
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,199
the series I I know that seems like a

270
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:29,509
lot to ask for some reason but it

271
00:09:29,509 --> 00:09:31,220
doesn't seem to me and that makes me

272
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,420
sound like an entitled gamer I

273
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:35,240
understand that I get that but ignore me

274
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,259
imagine the person who is at Blizzcon is

275
00:09:38,259 --> 00:09:41,120
actually entitled that is a person who's

276
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,249
such a big fan of the company that they

277
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,620
boarded a plane spending hundreds of

278
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,600
dollars on a ticket to fly to Anaheim

279
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,670
California to spend a hundred dollars on

280
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:52,069
a ticket to get in to attend the

281
00:09:52,069 --> 00:09:54,709
announcement of the next installment of

282
00:09:54,709 --> 00:09:56,899
their game in their franchise telling

283
00:09:56,899 --> 00:09:58,519
Blizzard said we have diablo news we

284
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:01,250
have diablo news and that's the diablo

285
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,410
news they got it won't be playable on

286
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:05,389
your favorite platform it won't be with

287
00:10:05,389 --> 00:10:07,160
the same type of game it won't look the

288
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,439
same and it'll be riddled with

289
00:10:08,439 --> 00:10:11,269
microtransactions now can you understand

290
00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:13,670
why they booed cuz I sure can and here's

291
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:15,019
something that everybody seems to be

292
00:10:15,019 --> 00:10:16,610
ignoring when you go back and you look

293
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:18,949
at that original clip of this guy asking

294
00:10:18,949 --> 00:10:20,480
his question he wasn't saying you

295
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,370
shouldn't be making this game he wasn't

296
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:23,959
saying this game shouldn't exist he

297
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:26,300
simply asked will this game ever come to

298
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:29,149
PC because he wants to play this game on

299
00:10:29,149 --> 00:10:31,129
the existing format that he's played

300
00:10:31,129 --> 00:10:33,680
literally every single Diablo game to

301
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,290
date on and I don't think that's a weird

302
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:38,480
thing to ask for and the company simply

303
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,459
said no and asked if he had a phone

304
00:10:40,459 --> 00:10:42,230
instead now you want to talk about

305
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:44,509
entitlement no offense to that developer

306
00:10:44,509 --> 00:10:46,730
but he came across as defensive and

307
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,490
maybe just a little bit entitled

308
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:51,559
entitled to that fans time entitled to

309
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:54,529
that fans money and forcing that fan to

310
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:57,199
play the game the way he wanted that fan

311
00:10:57,199 --> 00:10:59,420
to play it and here's the thing I don't

312
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,790
think entitlement works on either side I

313
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,529
think they really should consider

314
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:05,600
bringing the game to PC for fans like

315
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,730
him know in my Twitter timeline

316
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:09,740
today I've seen lots of journalists

317
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,420
defending this game and defending

318
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,370
blizzard and saying boogie if you don't

319
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:14,240
like this game

320
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,639
don't play it and chances are I will

321
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:18,529
still play it I will dabble with it I

322
00:11:18,529 --> 00:11:20,209
will give it a chance because that's

323
00:11:20,209 --> 00:11:22,160
what I do as a game and commentator and

324
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,320
I'll pick it apart if it sucks because

325
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,600
that's also part of what I do G I can

326
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,850
remember a time when gaming journalists

327
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:31,519
did the same thing that was cool but

328
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,230
you're right a lot of fans a lot of

329
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:35,449
enfranchised fans a lot of fans who've

330
00:11:35,449 --> 00:11:37,040
been waiting on a new Diablo game for

331
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,949
five six years now they won't play this

332
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,079
game they will skip it you are correct

333
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,449
and that sucks a lot for them and

334
00:11:44,449 --> 00:11:45,920
hopefully in the end it'll end up

335
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,540
sucking for Blizzard and they won't make

336
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,220
their money back and they'll learn to

337
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,860
make games that players actually want to

338
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:54,050
buy but the truth of the matter is this

339
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:55,579
game was never meant for in franchise

340
00:11:55,579 --> 00:11:58,130
players this game was designed to take

341
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:00,230
over Asian markets and that was the

342
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:02,149
biggest mistake here announcing this

343
00:12:02,149 --> 00:12:04,399
game at Blizzcon was kind of goofy and

344
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,440
kind of dumb you guys had to expect that

345
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,269
the West doesn't like mobile games we

346
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:10,250
like console games we like PC games and

347
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,470
so announcing it in the West instead of

348
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,420
announcing into the East that was your

349
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:16,069
big mistake and that's what's caused all

350
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,839
of this Blizzard so pay attention right

351
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,490
if you're creating a game for an Eastern

352
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:20,930
Market you should announce it in the

353
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:22,819
east and you should have saved the

354
00:12:22,819 --> 00:12:25,339
Diablo 4 announcement for the West but

355
00:12:25,339 --> 00:12:27,380
that's just one man's opinion I could be

356
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,060
wrong and I know that if I am you're

357
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,019
gonna let me know in the comments

358
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:31,670

359
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,740

future of the Diablo franchise I

363
00:12:37,459 --> 00:12:39,170
personally I'm just really excited for

364
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:41,180
the Warcraft 3 brewmaster I can't wait

365
