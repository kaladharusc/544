00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:39,989
Recommendation just because I'm curious how you're doing immediately the probe began recording a strange

31
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:45,050
Song coming from the comet's surface described as a drilling or clicking noise

32
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:50,180
It confused experts who to this days. All right. What is it gonna be it could be

33

Okay, basically a monkey it could be a mockney

34
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:05,519
Some scientists believe that the magnetic field surrounding the comet caused the sounds but what is this sound?

35
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:13,920
