1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:10,080
from what I understand this is the story

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,250
of the people who try to steal the Death

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,840
Star plans which drives the plot of a

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,460
new home I wonder if they'll succeed I

5
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:15,780
haven't felt this much suspense since

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,150
Titanic introducing Galen or so a hero

7
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:19,740
so heroic that he's never mentioned once

8
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,449
in the original Star Wars trilogy thanks

9
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:23,130
for building the Death Star off DUP so

10
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:24,330
we could destroy it dick

11
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:25,740
it's not a Star Wars breakfast without

12
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,390
some mysterious blue liquid why does

13
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,039
this ship land so fucking far away from

14
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,480
the home it's here to investigate why

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,949
double d's keep doing this you're on a

16
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:34,079
spaceship just land 20 feet from the

17
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,149
house is there any reason why gala needs

18
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:37,800
to wait for these guys to walk to his

19
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,629
farm so far away why hasn't he already

20
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:41,489
run away if his daughter can get away he

21
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:43,140
can too and don't tell me he knows about

22
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,340
building a Death Star and putting

23
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,989
weakness in it yet that comes later

24
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:47,520
having already seen this movie I kind of

25
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,539
wouldn't mind if instead of jumping

26
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:49,890
ahead in time they'd have just stayed on

27
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,870
young-jin growing old with Forest

28
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:52,289
Whitaker

29
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:54,210
a Star Wars story in movie stormtrooper

30
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,829
ties are much larger and cooler than any

31
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:57,570
other I got to play with back in the 80s

32
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:58,829
considering that they had this hiding

33
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:00,270
place that the discount stormtroopers

34
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,770
can't find was there really any reason

35
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,600
anyone had to die okay she's in space

36
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,580
prison but where does this open door the

37
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,409
camera is backing through lead to is the

38
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:11,689
prison apartment with multiple rooms

39
00:01:11,689 --> 00:01:14,040
this is essentially the fourth of eight

40
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,630
movies and the Star Wars franchise that

41
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,340
focuses on either the Death Star or

42
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,960
something like the Death Star get your

43
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,860
head out of your Death Star Star Wars

44
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,240
congratulations you are being rescued

45
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,490
good god I might have to start removing

46
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:27,810
sins just for the fact that Alan Tudyk

47
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:30,659
exists to dig come on moving I know we

48
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:31,619
have a lot of characters to meet a

49
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:33,150
little time to do so how am I supposed

50
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,040
to keep up with ring of Katherine Jetta

51
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,869
well Bonnie and this place

52
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:38,549
god damn this movie changes planets

53
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:39,930
faster than it guardians of the galaxy

54
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:42,390
film what is this it's a chance for you

55
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,189
to make a fresh start we like using

56
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:45,960
prisoners for make-or-break missions in

57
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,579
fact we're also waiting on Sean Connery

58
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:48,630
to finish getting a haircut

59
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,520
while we D thaw sliced alone and they'll

60
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,049
meet up with Jason Statham for transport

61
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:53,700
here this is captain Cassie and and old

62
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,159
rebel intelligence aka discount han Solo

63
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,409
also one happy Mon Mothma is in this and

64
00:01:58,409 --> 00:01:59,969
they got the same actress from Revenge

65
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:01,560
of the Sith to player but we're the was

66
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,790
she in a new hope this is kind of

67
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,290
confusing since she was the main rebel

68
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,790
leader and returned to the Jedi where

69
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,200
they're building yet another Death Star

70
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,119
but as you know that's way down a line

71
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,920
from a new hook we're hoping that he

72
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,420
would help us locate your father and

73
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:12,840
return him

74
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,480
to the Senate to the testimony you gotta

75
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,069
love when someone walks in on cue just

76
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:18,120
to show they're in the movie and

77
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,860
bridging continuity between the prequels

78
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,300
in this one that's basically his role

79
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,459
here you find him you kill him boss dude

80
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:25,019
tells kasi and to kill Galen if they

81
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:26,280
find it the guy that designed the

82
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,900
supposed planet killing weapon you don't

83
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,549
ask that guy a few questions maybe tear

84
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:31,709
gate him trust goes both ways but

85
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:33,420
neither of you trust each other even a

86
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,830
little bit this is one of those things

87
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,330
you say that sounds cool but makes no

88
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,519
fucking sense he's not trusting you nor

89
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:39,989
is he asking you to trust him ah

90
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:42,420
frightening CGI decisions also you

91
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,650
couldn't find a guy who looks like grand

92
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:45,239
moff tarkin you found someone who looks

93
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:46,920
enough like Mon Mothma I'm sure she was

94
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,540
in Revenge of the Sith dude that doesn't

95
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,739
mean you can't go on a casting call for

96
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:51,209
new Peter Cushing's this fucking

97
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:53,130
mind-reading Jabba ripoff with a dozen

98
00:02:53,130 --> 00:03:00,090
tentacle penises that's pretty insanely

99
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:02,190
useful but I'm wondering how did saw end

100
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:04,049
up hiring Bor goeth or did he just come

101
00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:07,530
with the Kate Pride this you just call

102
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,390
back to a new hope is call back what do

103
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,340
you know about Kaiba Christos my father

104
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,319
he he said they powered the jedis light

105
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:15,209
sabers is it just me or are the Kyber

106
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:17,010
crystals this movie's midi-chlorians in

107
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:18,450
other words things that rob you of the

108
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:23,010
mystery of star wars this line not only

109
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:24,660
makes a little sense it's never returned

110
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,280
to were paid off in any way it's just

111
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,670
random pseudo force poetry the guardians

112
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,709
of the wheels unless you have subtitles

113
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:33,450
the names of these things in movies are

114
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:35,069
totally confusing I heard this as

115
00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:36,450
guardians of the Wills in a movie

116
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,769
theater but apparently it's guardians of

117
00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:39,150
the Wills and now I gotta figure out

118
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:41,489
what the a will is oh it's the force

119
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:43,620
well the scene does a good job not

120
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:44,910
letting you know where anyone really is

121
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,739
and an even better job making you not

122
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:48,690
care I sure would like to see what

123
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:50,250
cassian is seeing right now I might

124
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:55,520
enjoy this action scene a lot more

125
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,990
did you know that wasn't me this is

126
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:59,790
almost remove as sin worthy but this is

127
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,830
a disobedient Android right here and how

128
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,510
the fuck did Kate 2's own over June and

129
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:07,080
casseon work Donnie Yen is a blind force

130
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,520
attune Star Wars character is such a

131
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,140
match made in heaven I'm not taking a

132
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,300
sin off the universe is stormtrooper

133
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,830
suddenly has alarmingly great aim when

134
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,150
it comes to hitting a stormtrooper being

135
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,950
used as human shield go back to the ship

136
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:19,920
wait for my call oh now he obeys after

137
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,600
ex machina disobeying and saving their

138
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,790
lives can you get us to Silver Arrow no

139
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:24,930
but all his soldiers who are

140
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:26,880
eavesdropping nearby just now can Jeddah

141
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,380
is nothing if not a place for convenient

142
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,300
timing that seems like a long walk to a

143
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,280
super obvious place for song Guerrero to

144
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,210
have been hiding all this time

145
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:35,100
but whatever the Empire is leaving cats

146
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,600
and dogs living together it's madness

147
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,560
hollow porn land this movie game in the

148
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,630
oxygen problem to pad the runtime from 2

149
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,910
hours 14 minutes to 2 hours 15 minutes I

150
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,840
mean yeah right we call it the death

151
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,550
there is no better name and the day is

152
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:52,770
coming soon when it will be unleashed

153
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:54,360
well it will be unleashed in mere

154
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,680
minutes on this very city

155
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,420
so pre-recorded Galen is pressing in as

156
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,970
here on accident has placed a weakness

157
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:02,250
deep within the system movie tries to

158
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,540
retroactively Lee excuse the Death

159
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,370
Star's ludicrous weak spot but fails

160
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:06,870
because that weak spot is still so

161
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,490
stupidly obvious someone in the Empire

162
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:09,720
should have noticed that long before

163
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,730
Luke trust of the force also Galen err

164
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:13,410
so created the small champ that Luke

165
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:14,820
will one day fire his one-in-a-million

166
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,070
one-in-a-million shot into winning the

167
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,450
day for the rebels but if he had this

168
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:19,860
kind of power in creating the Death Star

169
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:20,910
surely he could have figured out a way

170
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,440
that would not have required such long

171
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,020
odds there's literally no reason for the

172
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,430
Death Star to cause a total eclipse on

173
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,990
Jeddah before annihilating Jeddah city

174
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:29,520
cool shot that in no way makes sense

175
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,160
even lead the plans the structural plans

176
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,200
for the Death Star to find the reactor

177
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,370
why didn't Galen go ahead and send the

178
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,169
Death Star plans to saw yeah yeah the

179
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:38,730
plans are on some other planet but why

180
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,980
not at least sent a drawing or some if

181
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,540
he could get this message to saw surely

182
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,070
he could get the plans or a drawing to

183
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,780
him casseon uses a thing on an

184
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,100
inexplicably placed prison door

185
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,050
controller and makes his escape ah Star

186
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,730
Wars the universe we're merely shooting

187
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:52,620
a lot makes it unlock somehow this is

188
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,510
possible while this is also going on and

189
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,919
nobody important dies in the scene you

190
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,630
know Hollywood not everything exciting

191
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,550
has to occur at the very last second in

192
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:00,750
order to be exciting think about the

193
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,730
serendipity here the rebels find Jin in

194
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,440
a prison on some distant planet take her

195
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,850
to the rebel headquarters and send

196
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:07,410
casseon with her to go find Saul then

197
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:09,090
the Empire tests the Death Star on the

198
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:11,010
a planet where saw is he shows her the

199
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:12,419
gang later so recording and luckily

200
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:14,400
Qasim was able to totally bolt this way

201
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,410
out of his cell to save Jin just in time

202
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:17,580
to fly off the planet before they died

203
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,620
suicide by stubbornly refusing to leave

204
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,389
with the others I feel nothing

205
00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:23,880
he had his chances your work exceeds all

206
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,310
expectations said the studio to the CGI

207
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:28,169
firm after signing off and this totally

208
00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:29,250
not real looking grand moff tarkin

209
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:36,229
abomination everyone survives this

210
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,430
literally the only way Hollywood knowns

211
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,840
didn't own a mountaintop walk is

212
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,520
dangerous is the cliche of a few rocks

213
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,530
falling off the path how are there not

214
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:47,970
at least six people dead after critic

215
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:51,090
just yelled fire no one here is any of

216
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:52,380
this I guess the film chalks it up to

217
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,270
the rainstorm but honestly that's pretty

218
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,979
fucking stupid also I know Jin is a

219
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:57,870
badass but a one-armed tug on this

220
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,430
stormtroopers gun and he goes flying off

221
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:01,410
the edge get the squadron leader on get

222
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:03,419
him on now they're already engaged then

223
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:04,710
several seconds of them flying through

224
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:05,669
the mountain peaks before they're

225
00:07:05,669 --> 00:07:07,289
actually on site engaged but what

226
00:07:07,289 --> 00:07:08,370
happens like this movie gives a shit

227
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:10,470
about time also didn't bode tell Cassie

228
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:11,610
and a few moments ago that getting

229
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:12,990
through these canyons was tough because

230
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:14,639
the Empire had sensors and all through

231
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:14,850
it

232
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:15,930
why were they able to fly through here

233
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:20,400
without any alarms going off this

234
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,780
doesn't kill nearly as many of these

235
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:24,270
assholes as you'd think it would get the

236
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,229
sense that this guy could have been a

237
00:07:25,229 --> 00:07:26,940
Jedi but the Jedi Council hadn't passed

238
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,130
any a DA laws back then Jin's reunion

239
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:30,930
with her dad is prolonged by spaceships

240
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:32,580
exhaust because this movie stretches out

241
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,260
every single moment two to five seconds

242
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,880
longer than it should hopefully she gets

243
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,320
to him just before he dies

244
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,720
oh good she did hmm you lied about why

245
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,130
we came here and you lied about why you

246
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:43,020
went up hello well he did take the pilot

247
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,729
guy with him so he didn't go up alone

248
00:07:44,729 --> 00:07:46,349
which if I'm being honest agree it's a

249
00:07:46,349 --> 00:07:47,639
bit of a dent in your anger argument

250
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:49,740
could the Empire get any more Sauron yep

251
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,120
this movie's gonna use the Allred

252
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,889
helmeted Imperial Guard dudes even

253
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,450
though a new hope and Empire both had

254
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:55,770
none of them apparently just before you

255
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:57,180
got to know invader was using these red

256
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,979
dudes as bodyguards on the regular it's

257
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,380
hard to create problems has certainly

258
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,090
been confirmed damn

259
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:04,410
Darth Vader's beginning to sound as bad

260
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:06,360
as Bugs Bunny without Mel Blanc which is

261
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,950
weird since this is before a new hope

262
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,150
it's almost like the actor doing his

263
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:11,070
phony says 40 years older now so weird

264
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:13,800
until you can assure the Emperor the

265
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,080
Gaiden or so has not compromised this

266
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,530
weapon in any way especially in any

267
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,270
obvious and easily detectable way that a

268
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,620
child would spot instantly

269
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,360
like gas vents that lead back to a main

270
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,060
engine so I'm still in come on

271
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,919
he's leaving dude why would you even

272
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:31,350
risk asking this be careful not to choke

273
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:36,120
on your ass for me she's director but

274
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,620
Darth Vader spent some time as James

275
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,650
Bond from 1960 to 1962 the question is

276
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:43,469
what choice run high plead for mercy

277
00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:45,360
scatter your forces movies just gonna

278
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,680
suddenly give the prisoner angry

279
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,150
daughter character not only the wisdom

280
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,890
for an inspiring speech but the public

281
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:50,880
speaking and motivational skills

282
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,980
required to make it work okay movie but

283
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,450
I tuned out about half a jetta ago

284
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:57,150
you're asking us to invade an imperial

285
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,430
installation based on nothing but hope

286
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:01,470
nice line but no she's got information

287
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:03,210
about the installations weakness as well

288
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,040
as legit experience versus imperial

289
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,050
troops Andy blind force a ninja for a

290
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:09,240
friend rebellions built on hope

291
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,710
yeah just like I've always believed for

292
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:12,570
this entire movie get with that yunnan

293
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:15,029
hoping pieces of no show four of us is

294
00:09:15,029 --> 00:09:17,670
quite enough oh man you doing it's kind

295
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:18,930
of amazing that the rebellion didn't

296
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:19,890
think to send a small group of

297
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:21,420
volunteers to do exactly what gin is

298
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,680
going to do they have an impounded

299
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,630
Imperial ship two Imperial defectors and

300
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,070
they always fight when the numbers are

301
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:27,450
against them so what did they have to

302
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:28,950
lose by sending some dedicated fighters

303
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:29,820
did I do

304
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,800
I believe you for no reason at all other

305
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,650
than hell the script says I do so let's

306
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:37,290
do this road one rogue credits normally

307
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:38,790
and I'd shoot this ship down but they

308
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:42,600
promoted Gary over me friend yes I will

309
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,520
send for you need someone you can trust

310
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,650
I would trust her with my life I thought

311
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:48,150
Princess Leia was on our way to Alderaan

312
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:49,740
at the beginning of a new home and Vader

313
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,180
boarded their ship around the time they

314
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,100
reached Tatooine so sending the plans

315
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,080
with r2d2 to give to obi-wan was a Hail

316
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,270
Mary but here apparently she was sent to

317
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,800
see obi-wan before the rebellion even

318
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,480
new rogue Wan went on their own sanction

319
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:07,080
mission w00t arrival schedule new flood

320
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,700
station and even though there was a

321
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,380
rebel attack there no one informed you

322
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,270
of a rerouted ship because at this point

323
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,770
everyone in the Empire is bad at their

324
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:14,310
jobs

325
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:16,380
silver arrow used to say one fighter

326
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,570
with a sharp stick shut up

327
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:19,770
after everything I've sent through you

328
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:21,180
mean to tell me these men need a miracle

329
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,950
on ice style pep talk prior to their

330
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:25,470
battle this is the movie esteem ubi has

331
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:26,910
tried to movie on my ass and it makes me

332
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:27,420
angry

333
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,680
makes me angry and I'm gonna start

334
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,150
ranting soon I'll be looking for a

335
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:32,760
manifest that would be helpful

336
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,470
you know where you keep such things no

337
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,050
reason to be suspicious good luck

338
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:39,050
but is this what well don't you look at

339
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,339
that they took the clothes off the

340
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:41,510
inspection team and they conveniently

341
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,519
fit Cassie and Jin I've got a bad

342
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,610
feeling about me Oh boom ooh be

343
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:48,790
intercepted Imperial transmission mom

344
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:51,170
zone scaris even though this proves

345
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:52,760
nothing and the rebellion was dead set

346
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,290
against going to scare if they send

347
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:56,209
everyone there now because rebels are

348
00:10:56,209 --> 00:10:59,260
the rebels decided to defy orders

349
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:02,209
if bb-8 and Ketu it so have replaced

350
00:11:02,209 --> 00:11:03,829
both of you in our hearts you aren't the

351
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:04,640
droids we're looking for

352
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,800
move along I can locate the tape but

353
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,149
you'll need to use the handles for

354
00:11:08,149 --> 00:11:10,339
extraction excuse me the tape did he

355
00:11:10,339 --> 00:11:13,250
just save the tape watchtower

356
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,720
why keep it tight doesn't that just

357
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,130
increase the odds the cannons will hit

358
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:17,930
one of your squadron why not fan out

359
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:19,579
wide and force them to constantly move

360
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:21,110
their fire to hit one of you bunched up

361
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:22,610
together you make one bigger target

362
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:24,320
padding the XP and kill stats for

363
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,610
whichever Endor is Manning that

364
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:27,320
particular cannon so for these assholes

365
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,029
waiting for the skirmish has been going

366
00:11:29,029 --> 00:11:33,350
on ten minutes geez archive footage now

367
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:35,779
so you've got CGI plastered over other

368
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:37,880
actors posing as the original actors you

369
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,860
have new actors replacing old actors and

370
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,540
now you're just reusing old footage what

371
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:45,160
was the deciding factor on all these

372
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:49,040
alas poor red 5 I knew not status that's

373
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,459
it because it's me yeah but what happens

374
00:11:52,459 --> 00:11:53,750
if you're not the person looking for the

375
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,550
plants what if you die you mean to tell

376
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,899
me that Galen left all this to chance

377
00:11:56,899 --> 00:11:58,579
this further illustrates why it was so

378
00:11:58,579 --> 00:11:59,959
stupid he didn't send the plans along

379
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:01,520
with Bodhi in the first place or a copy

380
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,320
of them or at least a general thing to

381
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:08,400
look for when attacking the Death Star

382
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:12,279
[Music]

383
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:14,660
Jesus the radio and satellite this

384
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,730
finale is in confusing with all this

385
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:18,260
stuff gin and Cassie underdoing and

386
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,579
tandem with what bodis doing this

387
00:12:19,579 --> 00:12:22,810
conflict will warp your mind into jelly

388
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:26,300
but c-3po got at least eight movies why

389
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,890
is she wearing Deadpool style double

390
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:29,690
swords on her back we seen her use that

391
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:31,310
kind of thing at all in this movie yeah

392
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:32,839
yeah she snuck in here and some bounty

393
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:34,910
hunter droid costume thing but still he

394
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,079
had your hair I'm wearing this for the

395
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:37,459
climax I never once let her use them

396
00:12:37,459 --> 00:12:39,110
that's a sin for the costume designer I

397
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:42,140
think the muscle sweets a title for that

398
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:45,190
code so go

399
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:47,240
just look at the size of that hard drive

400
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,040
whatever it is thing and sure the death

401
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,750
star plans are probably a huge file but

402
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,450
Jesus Leia puts them inside r2d2 later

403
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:55,370
so why the empire need this much storage

404
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:57,020
this is like the Rebel Alliance having

405
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,880
moved on to mp3s while the Empire is

406
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,830
still on eight tracks guys I'm having a

407
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:02,089
hard time figuring out which character

408
00:13:02,089 --> 00:13:03,980
is blind in this scene blind guy who can

409
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,870
see incoming blaster shots and enemies

410
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,520
during battle has to feel around for the

411
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,709
right lever on the console

412
00:13:09,709 --> 00:13:11,720
I mean you made this way too hard for us

413
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,120
but you know good job I guess I like how

414
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,560
once everyone is fulfilled their one

415
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,360
crucial plot duty they die immediately

416
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,950
it's as if the bad guys know to wait 10

417
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:20,420
seconds after they finish to finally

418
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,770
figure out how to kill these people what

419
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:26,270
the unholy fuck is this bull the thing

420
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,860
to set the antenna alignment is on the

421
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,839
edge of this walkway for some reason

422
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:31,459
instead of where all the other controls

423
00:13:31,459 --> 00:13:35,089
are misalign was it somehow hit during

424
00:13:35,089 --> 00:13:36,680
this battle by a we were neck swing that

425
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,180
misaligned it but didn't actually damage

426
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,649
it do they have to realign it every time

427
00:13:39,649 --> 00:13:40,820
they want to send a message out of here

428
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,250
my father's revenge he built a floor on

429
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,380
the desktop why would you say this I've

430
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,700
heard of the bad guy monologuing in

431
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,440
situations like this but the good guy

432
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:53,390
died with the rebellion dead guy ex

433
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:56,110
machina

434
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:58,550
now if they got this transmission then

435
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:59,779
why didn't everybody in the rebellion

436
00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:01,459
have the Death Star plans maybe they

437
00:14:01,459 --> 00:14:03,079
said only this ship could receive the

438
00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:04,790
transmission but ghin used a satellite

439
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,800
to beam these things into space anybody

440
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,060
could have gotten them right look how

441
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,770
badly he's limping right here how did he

442
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:12,079
climb up even if he somehow knew about

443
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:13,940
and had a keycard for and then took the

444
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,620
same elevator Critic did he's limping

445
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,029
too badly to have made it up here in

446
00:14:17,029 --> 00:14:19,690
time this is some of the highest order

447
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:22,010
Wow oh yeah look at that hoist it with

448
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:24,079
his own death star movie rips off to sit

449
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:25,190
on a beach in a week for the sweet

450
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:26,720
incoming death scene from Deep Impact

451
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,300
the rebel flagship his disciple on board

452
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,980
but has received transmissions from the

453
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:34,100
surface the an Arab boarding party yes

454
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,930
yes prepare a boarding party for the

455
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:38,029
rebel flagship but by all means allow a

456
00:14:38,029 --> 00:14:39,830
small ship to fly out of it later is

457
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:41,510
this scene with darth vader badass and

458
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,310
awesome yes that's a contradict

459
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:44,779
basically every physical movement Vader

460
00:14:44,779 --> 00:14:47,269
made in the original trilogy yes still

461
00:14:47,269 --> 00:14:50,450
though this Vader scene holy seriously

462
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:51,950
why are there no Imperial ships around

463
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:53,420
to stop this it's like everybody

464
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,220
disappeared a minute ago they had ships

465
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,779
blasting the rebel flagship but I guess

466
00:14:56,779 --> 00:14:57,890
they were told to vanish once Vader

467
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:59,630
boarded it by this point everyone should

468
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:01,250
know of the magnet hide a ship inside

469
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,140
bigger ships and do everything they can

470
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:05,209
to prevent it from leaving ah more

471
00:15:05,209 --> 00:15:06,860
terrible CGI decisions perhaps even

472
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,630
worse than the previous ones also I

473
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:10,430
guess when Bale told Leia to go find

474
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:12,019
obi-wan she decided to put herself in

475
00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:13,640
danger just in case the rebels were able

476
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,500
to find the Death Star plans why does

477
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,310
she have to do everything

478
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:17,839
I can't there be somebody else in charge

479
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,040
of the plans while she goes to find

480
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,480
obi-wan I think the connection between

481
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,640
this and a new hope is a bit jagged help

482
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,820
ah gu movie hope hope hope hope hope

483
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,260
hope hope say do you remember the first

484
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,820
movie was called a new hope hope hope

485
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:31,370
Bobbo Hope Solo the ship takes off using

486
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:33,079
hyperspace and somehow didn't get to the

487
00:15:33,079 --> 00:15:35,410
planet before Vader tracks them down

488
