1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,400
People who like Pewds...

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,420
...People who don't like Pewds...

3
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,060
...Making fun of Pewds.

4
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,640
Why am I here?

5
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,420
*deep thoughts*

6
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:14,460
I'm just singing the LWIAY intro.

7
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,380
Because people like when I did it last episode.

8
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:19,120
*laughs*

9
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,120
Welcome to LWAAAH!

10
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:21,980
*guttural noise*

11
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,740
I might be editing this one as well.

12
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,520
That is true.

13
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,120
Brad is not here. *Ha!! Who's laughing now?!*

14
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,940
Brad 2 Died... *Press F for Respect.*

15
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,100
...and here I am.

16
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,520
Who nee- I need a video the same day.

17
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,260
Guys...!!

18
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,520
I don't wanna edit this! I'm already tired.

19
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,640
GODDAMIT!!

20
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,700
Roll the Intro...

21
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,660
...Felix.

22
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,600
Goddamn. I'm retarded.

23
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,840
*laughs*

24
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,600
Yes!

25
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,520
I think...

26
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,640
I still have the car.

27
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,160
I think it's illegal for me to drive that car.

28
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,080
But we need a part two.

29
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,940
This was a better time.

30
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,440
Interesting hair style from Marzia.

31
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:10,100
I wish, okay? I wish Marzia would go back to this look.

32
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,420
She looked way better.

33
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,760
Nice try. But you know what we want.

34
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,660
*frustrated pause*

35
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:21,060
It's so great to be part of a channel where... the entire universe just hates you.

36
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,020
*chuckle*

37
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,240
It's like &quot;People who don't like Pewds&quot;...

38
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,840
...&quot;People who don't like Pewds&quot;...

39
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,660
Here I am, everybody!

40
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:30,960
What you meant to say was &quot;People who like Pewds&quot; and &quot;People who don't like Pewds.

41
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,960
And trust me I'm starting to not like you either, Pewds!

42
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,040
Sixty-five million subscribers.

43
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,980
Going. Strong.

44
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,860
*Laughing*

45
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:43,340
&quot;Felix reaction to memes with Marzia be like:&quot;

46
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:46,200
Oh my god. It continues.

47
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,820
&quot;Pewds eats a picture of him&quot;

48
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,920
Right! So, he didn't complete it.

49
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,140
He wrote me on Twitter saying &quot;No, this is fake&quot;.

50
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,320
&quot;I haven't done it yet.&quot;

51
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,320
So, no.

52
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,380
Uhh, &quot;Lego Star Wars Gameplay&quot;.

53
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,500
It's coming, guys. It's coming.

54
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,560
&quot;Get an Alexa&quot;

55
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,380
Alexa!

56
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:05,620
*Alexa doesn't respond*

57
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:06,360
Hello?

58
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,560
*Alexa still doesn't respond*

59
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,760
GODDAMMIT!

60
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:12,140
*Alexa plays music that cuts off randomly*

61
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,080
*music abruptly stops*

62
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,060
No.

63
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,640
Don't ever do that again.

64
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,500
Alexa! Never do that again!

65
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,420
*Alexa takes a minute to compose herself*

66
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,060
Alexa: Sorry, I'm not sure.

67
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:23,600
*Angery gibberish*

68
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,460
There you go. You can check that one off.

69
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,800
&quot;Play his guitar&quot;

70
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,080
Okay. Alright. Okay. Alright.

71
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:29,620
*Clap*

72
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:33,620
This guitar has been in the background in my videos for too long.

73
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:37,060
It's missing a string and I just haven't been bothered to fix it.

74
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,800
I could easily fix it.

75
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,200
*Clap* If. *Clap* This. *Clap* Video gets five-hundred-thousand likes

76
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:49,300
I will play Despacito on guitar as all-- as promised.

77
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,400
Next week, okay?

78
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,320
Okay?

79
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,280
Alright?

80
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,220
Okay? Okay.

81
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,000
*silence*

82
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,780
*Alexa suddenly starts playing music*

83
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:57,440
WHAT THE F--

84
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,840
&quot;Nine year-olds. Brad and Sive's funny editing.&quot;

85
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,880
&quot;Nine year-old's. Felix sh--&quot;

86
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,400
Thank you so much.

87
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,480
I make a Pewdiepie propaganda poster.

88
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,600
Okay.

89
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,640
This is epic.

90
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,260
I like this.

91
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:11,860
*Clap clap*

92
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:12,920
I like this a lot.

93
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,960
*Chuckles*

94
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,760
&quot;YouTube. Me.&quot;

95
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,620
&quot;Can You Cast Obsidian?&quot;

96
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,800
*like Alinity* Can we cast Obsidian?!

97
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,900
Yeah. This video's everywhere.

98
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,140
Can you stop recommending it to me?

99
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,280
Stop it. No one cares about &quot;Obsibdian&quot;.

100
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,180
*realizes he mispronounced obsidian*

101
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,020
What was that? What was that, Felix?

102
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,880
Obsibdian

103
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,780
Alright. That's cool.

104
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,780
&quot;Kids.. have crushes&quot;

105
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,880
&quot;Men.. have girlfriends&quot;

106
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,580
&quot;Legends have... depression&quot;

107
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,880
*awkward silence*

108
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,980
Alexa, this is so sad.

109
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:47,100
Can we play Despacito number five-thousand-five-hundred and nine?

110
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,440
*Alexa processes in silence*

111
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,100
*Alexa stopped listening*

112
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:55,740
There's no Despacito five-thousand-five-hundred and nine.

113
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:56,240
*gentle sob*

114
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,800
Ay! &quot;Now we can create the 22nd biggest country in the world.

115
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,760
This is really cool.

116
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:05,420
Finally something positive on this LWIAY

117
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:10,020
&quot;I wonder how many of those people are dead.&quot;

118
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:10,820
MOVING ON!

119
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,000
&quot;Reacting to his most popular video&quot;

120
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,120
&quot;Reacting to his MOST UNpopular video&quot;

121
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,760
You just got myself a video idea.

122
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,680
I like you, whoever did this.

123
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,700
*clap* Very good.

124
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,960
Alex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex--

125
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,680
Okay. Alright.

126
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:30,500
&quot;When you remember you left Brad 1 and Brad 2 chained to the basement without food&quot;

127
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,360
It happens, guys. It happens

128
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,540
That's probably why I have to edit this video.

129
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,540
*laughing*

130
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:44,820
&quot;Brad 1 and 2 laughing when they see that PewDiePie has to edit his own video but then sees how much everyone enjoyed Felix's shh editing&quot;

131
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,960
&quot;When Marzia--&quot;*chuckles*

132
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,260
&quot;When Marzia tells y--&quot; yo-- I gue--

133
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,620
I guess you guys figured me out, huh?

134
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,260
You figured me out.

135
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,960
Yes, I play Minecraft.

136
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,900
What are you going to do, you nine year-old virgins?

137
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,500
*chuckle*

138
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,360
&quot;You're fired&quot;

139
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,360
&quot;You're unable to work here again&quot;

140
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,140
&quot;You're jobn't&quot;

141
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,320
Or, my favorite

142
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,760
&quot;You're promoted to customer&quot;

143
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,140
*clap clap* Well done.

144
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,100
*chuckles and claps*

145
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,480
It's not bad memes this week.

146
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,940
I have actually

147
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,020
laughing at them.

148
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:20,760
&quot;I went to the highest mountain in Sweden just to t-pose and rep merch.&quot;

149
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,320
What an absolute mad lad.

150
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,320
Congratulations

151
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:27,060
Check out merch. Only available four more days.

152
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,400
Oh wait. &quot;The nine year-olds are getting younger&quot;

153
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:48,320
*Pewdiepie ending theme plays* (an actual footage of me jamming to pewds outro)

154
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,380
Awww. He loves it.

155
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,820
*baby giggling*

156
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:54,340
&quot;Hey, guys. I'm having some trouble with my YouTube Red membership. Can you help?&quot;

157
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:58,760
&quot;We'd like to help. Could you share more details about the issue? We'll look into it.&quot;

158
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:05,120
&quot;I can't seem to find season 2 of Scare Pewdiepie. Can you help?&quot;

159
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,260
*clap*This *clap* is so *clap* great.

160
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:14,660
If this gets five-thousand likes I will leak Scare Pewdiepie Season 2 on DailyMotions, everybody. ?? (ohhh shet im not ready)

161
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,500
*high pitched voice* Well, is he really going to do it?

162
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,400
Hmmmm

163
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,680
Five-thousand likes and you'll find out.  ͡(° ͜ʖ ͡°)

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,820
&quot;I met Pewdiepie five days ago.&quot;

165
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:26,340
&quot;I got roped into watching my 3 month old niece while my sister got her hair done.&quot;

166
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:32,760
&quot;So there I am,  sitting in the waiting area of a hair salon and who walks in but effing Pewdiepie himself?&quot; (dont swear (｀Д´)

167
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:38,960
&quot;I was nervous as shhht, and just kept looking at him and he was sitting there with his phone and waited but&quot;

168
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,200
&quot;was too scared to say anything to him.

169
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,840
&quot;Pretty soon my niece started crying,&quot;

170
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:49,520
&quot; and I'm trying to quiet her down because I didn't want her to bother Pewds, but she wouldn't stop.&quot;

171
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,220
I-- I was there. I remember this, actually. (me too, I also was there. I'm the hair straightener (´∀`)

172
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,320
&quot;Pretty soon he gets up and walks over.&quot;

173
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:58,900
&quot;He started running his hands through her hair (＾▽＾) and asked what was wrong (・о・)

174
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,240
&quot;I replied that she was probably hungry

175
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,520
or something.&quot;

176
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:07,740
&quot;So Pewds put down his phone, picked up my niece, and lifted his shirt. (FBI OPEN UP (ﾉಠдಠ)ﾉ︵┻━┻

177
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:11,260
&quot;H--uh-- He breast fed her right there&quot; (lets all take a moment of silence ఠ_ఠ)

178
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:11,800
*struggling to keep reading* (・・；)

179
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,580
&quot;in the middle of the hair salon.&quot; ⊙△⊙

180
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:17,060
&quot;Chill guy, really nice about it.  (≧▽≦)

181
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,060
&quot;Would let him breast feed my niece again.&quot; ????

182
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:22,100
*awkward silence* inner pewds: wtf did i just read
(꒪⌓꒪) . 10/10 would win Oscar.

183
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:25,220
&quot;The Italian stereotype is true!

184
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:28,140
&quot;This is so sad&quot; *while laughing* (alexa play italy national anthem)

185
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,380
I love how many people pointed this out in the video.

186
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,540
&quot;Five lies that girls tell:&quot; (NUMBER 5 WILL SHOCK YOU ??)

187
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,540
&quot;I'm fine&quot; ( ￣＾￣)

188
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,760
&quot;I'm not jealous&quot; (ಠ⌣ಠ)

189
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,700
&quot;I'm over him&quot; (╥_╥)

190
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,200
&quot;Sure we can be friends&quot; (♡ &gt;ω&lt; ♡)

191
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:41,560

195
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:51,820
Okay. ｖ(⌒ｏ⌒)ｖ

196
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,820
I'm gonna-- I'm gonna title this video (　･`ω･´) *thinks very hard*

That, that is what they're watching.

200
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:06,760
So, everyone comment in the video saying &quot;wow, that is epic.&quot;

201
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,940
&quot;You can actually cast obsidian&quot; *while laughing*

&quot;The Marzia idea was good but we need to stop making demands because it makes

206
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:21,720
&quot;the content even less original and the subreddit sucks now&quot;

207
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,580
It's always sucked. Don't worry about it.
