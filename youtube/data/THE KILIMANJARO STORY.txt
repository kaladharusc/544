going to be a certain time

9
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,500
I was another super casual thirteen and

10
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,200
a half mile run this morning I've been

11
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,360
writing like crazy lately

12
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:52,739
I mean I've been running like 13 14 15

13
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:55,440
miles a day every single day for the

14
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,510
entirety of this summer I just I can't

15
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:58,290
get enough

16
00:00:58,290 --> 00:00:59,550
not having getting a lot of questions on

17
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,260
Twitter about people who are curious

18
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,790
about running maybe I'll make like a

19
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:05,670
Casey guide to running video or

20
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,920
something but a quick piece of advice

21
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,290
for newcomers to running if you've never

22
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:11,430
run before the only thing you should be

23
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,460
focusing on is time like can you run for

24
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,560
five minutes without stopping and then

25
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,210
ten minutes without stopping and then I

26
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:19,890
half an hour without stopping don't

27
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:20,940
worry about pace or anything like that

28
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,280
get to that bit later focus on the

29
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,300
amount of time you can spend on your

30
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,790
feet to that that's the first hurdle to

31
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:27,710
overcome

32
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:31,080
okay okay today on the vlog I will do

33
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,310

00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:20,769
we have us we didn't have a plan for

68
00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:23,799
anything our first day here we decided

69
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:26,680
to start the climb immediately that we

70
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,500
sure if we went there with enough cash

71
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,909
that we would find somebody to take us

72
00:03:30,909 --> 00:03:36,010
up the mountain which was the case later

73
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,329
this month naturally we load the

74
00:03:37,329 --> 00:03:40,090
cheapest least expensive guide we could

75
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:44,080
find positive to get up challenger

76
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,720
[Music]

77
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,930
they were great nice guys I think we

78
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,960
realized on our way there that what the

79
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,660
value package got you yeah

80
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:58,350
very cheap meat cooker get the meat then

81
00:03:58,350 --> 00:03:59,670
we're going to eat on our hikes the top

82
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:11,160
of the mountain here it is now that's

83
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:14,490
our cut so this guy turtle is one of the

84
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:17,010
guys that was the best on the team and

85
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:21,660
he was the official whiskey impresario

86
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:25,610
you guys like whiskey that's except it

87
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:28,290
was weird cuz we stopped at the grocery

88
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:29,970
store to get food for the climb and all

89
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:32,340
that the African guides were suggestions

90
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:35,370
that we buy lots of alcohol for them

91
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:36,860
[Applause]

92
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:40,470

93
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:44,130
summit have to drink we're about to

94
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:45,870
start our mission up to the top of

95
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:50,400
Kilimanjaro one day it was amazing of

96
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,780
this climate you literally started in a

97
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,790
rainforest and on the last day we were

98
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:57,090
like standing on snow and ice that is

99
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:00,720
Mount Kilimanjaro my thumb is blocking

100
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,900
the Sun we have all these dudes carrying

101
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:07,340
all of our stuff it wasn't our choice

102
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:10,710
shooting the porters Porter's are

103
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,000
carrying up all the gear but just the

104
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,400
sheer amount of they're carrying the law

105
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,340
in Tanzania mandates that for every

106
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:20,760
climber you have at least one person

107
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:27,180
carrying your gear and it's a way to

108
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,860
like bolster local economies but also

109
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,510
they do it for safety we could carry

110
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,850
around we tried to they wouldn't let us

111
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:34,950
is that setting up camp on our first

112
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:39,240
night not actually us setting it up

113
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,240
other people setting up before us

114
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,919
when we're booking the guides we were

115
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:48,090
told we would have high quality chef

116
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:52,240
traveling with us this is their tent

117
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,210
where they cooked the food what was his

118
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:55,569

Oh crew Graham celebrated his 25th

122
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:08,639
birthday on Mount Kilimanjaro happy

123
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:24,759
birthday great birthday and dinner

124
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:28,270
I don't know why I thought it was a good

125
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,800
idea to climb out so many darling

126
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:35,050
sneakers supposed to wear hiking boots

127
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:36,370
when you're climbing the highest

128
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:38,439
freestanding mount in the world but you

129
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,599
chose sneakers my hiking sneakers are

130
00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:50,620
frozen solid this is going to be a

131
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,779
problem two days then you can really

132
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:55,180
start to notice me fading I look like a

133
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,849
really ugly woman and this is our

134
00:06:57,849 --> 00:06:59,919
campsite on the second day we thought

135
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,569
it'd be a good idea that instead of

136
00:07:01,569 --> 00:07:03,729
spending six days climbing we'd spend

137
00:07:03,729 --> 00:07:09,789
three days climbing twice as fast then

138
00:07:09,789 --> 00:07:11,349
we used the rest of our time in Africa

139
00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:14,259
to travel it was a great idea until the

140
00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:17,889
morning of the summit climb the craziest

141
00:07:17,889 --> 00:07:19,389
part of being up here is that were above

142
00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:25,360
the clouds I just want to point one

143
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,180
thing out also the Red Hat that Casey's

144
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:31,089
wearing so Megan the summit push

145
00:07:31,089 --> 00:07:34,569
tomorrow so not only did he not bring

146
00:07:34,569 --> 00:07:36,669
hiking boot but he also didn't bring a

147
00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:39,669
hat that was a hat that I've had three

148
00:07:39,669 --> 00:07:44,610
school camps this is campus third day

149
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:47,430
freezing out here

150
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:50,019
you're about to witness the moment when

151
