1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,770
I hope I can help

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:12,519
Necromancy may be legal in Cyrodiil but few will openly admit to practicing it now that the mages guild has banned it

3
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:22,050
Farewell

4
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,669
May you rest in peace

5
00:00:26,669 --> 00:00:32,369
Oh, yeah play video games

6
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:49,110
Watch someone else play video. That's right. I'm joining you guys

7
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,620
How stupid can you be

8
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:56,430
Come on, you guys have been doing it for years. Well, I can't do it oblivion is it's my weakness

9
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:05,220
This game is just God's gift to earth Thank You. Todd Howard son. Thank you. Fun fact ton Howard was in the Chess Club

10
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,400
Nothing cracks me up like this game. So

11
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,880
Let's just jump into it. The other one got deleted in case anyone is curious what happened to it

12
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:20,850
But we have a ton of new of Lybian memes. Thanks to bacon who apparently took it upon himself to single-handedly

13
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:24,299
resurrect this this game

14
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:28,259
What's going on?

15
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:30,899
Stop you

16
00:01:30,899 --> 00:01:37,649
Bow or serve your sentence your stolen goods are now forfeit

17
00:01:37,649 --> 00:01:47,850
Then pay with your blood

18
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,979
That's great

19
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:55,130
This game is too good. I never actually played this game. I just know I love it. That's all

20
00:01:55,130 --> 00:02:00,799
I know Todd Howard god bless your soul and they clearly were way too ambitious with this title

21
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:08,340
And that's what makes it so goddamn beautiful. I was writing games when I was you know, 12, whatever and

22
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:13,500
The other kids in the block would say, you know, I'm gonna play quarterback for the Cowboys and I'd be like

23
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,980
I'm gonna make video games and everyone's gonna play

24
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,890
You dork go back to the Chess Club

25
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:23,459
Who's laughing now?

26
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:28,840
Yes, I was in the Chess Club

27
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:37,540
Who's laughing now, I like how it goes from confident to insecure just like that who's laughing now?

28
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,790
Yeah

29
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:51,340
God bless you Todd, I'm Rena brilliant. I love dogs doesn't everyone everyone does

30
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:55,560
How do you get that perfect timing god damn it only in Oblivion

31
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:02,680
I am ready burn it one thing. You need to know about me. I love dogs. Does it every

32
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,890
How does that happen what

33
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,210
in most games these days

34
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:08,460
It's all about you know

35
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:14,040
Duck and Cover and and wait for your enemy to come out and then, you know waiting for the right move

36
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:22,180
It's a lot of waiting is very boring but not nothing speaks like a real action movie nothing tops the matrix times a hundred

37
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:35,950
Thousand million like the Oblivion combat. Just why Brittani?

38
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:43,840
You're pathetic

39
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:50,349
Take that

40
00:03:50,349 --> 00:04:05,200
Goddamn it when you fail at the long range, you just gotta step in on that close range. You're pathetic

41
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:11,140
Beautiful with that fire now ain't it a surprise

42
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:16,440
No sign of them they do that in LA a lot it that's Skyrim to be fair, but they do that in life

43
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:21,850
Just kill someone immediately. That's no sign of him. I guess he's gone

44
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:27,580
Oh

45
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:46,090
My god

46
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:59,290
Does everyone have a dislocated shoulder. What is going on? Wait, what the hell is this Oh,

47
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:04,360
Todd Howard seduces, you too, Matt. They're mad at Fleetwood Mac's right? It's me

48
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,580
Bethesda's Todd Howard

49
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,700
look, I know you told me not to come around and

50
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:14,200
Know after we bought skyrim for the Xbox one. You said you were done

51
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,020
At least let me plead my case

52
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,820
No

53
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:26,440
Poor is the perfect game. It'll have no lobe time. Yeah, did you like that?

54
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:33,880
No, I can't I'm sorry, I'll save this for later. Yes. Oh great and mighty grand champion. Is there something you need?

55
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:41,200
Can I carry your weapon shine your boots that road perhaps where it's gonna shoot room in the air. Oh, is it the classic? Oh

56
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,810
Gee, you sure

57
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:50,410
Okay. Well, I'll be hanging around the arena grounds if you need someone to share the ground you walk on

58
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:53,140
Absolutely, beautiful. Absolutely

59
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,700
magnificent oh

60
00:05:54,700 --> 00:06:01,390
my god

61
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:13,720
He just broke his back he's fine he's fine it happens all the time he does that all the time

62
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:18,169
Happening

63
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:26,659
This game is so confusing. I think that's why it makes it so good. You see someone run past just now

64
00:06:26,659 --> 00:06:38,059
Well, if you do grab him and yell it bastard stole from me

65
00:06:38,059 --> 00:06:44,479
Did you see thump is that how Americans try to do like Nordic accent is that is that how you see yes, huh?

66
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:50,629
Racism have you seen anyone in plain sight do you see that man right there?

67
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:54,639
You know the action is very exciting of in oblivion and Skyrim, of course

68
00:06:54,639 --> 00:07:01,509
But nothing really entices me and immerses me like the dialogue that really makes me feel like I'm part of the world

69
00:07:01,509 --> 00:07:05,629
It feels like real dialogues real people real communication

70
00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:07,129
How goes it?

71
00:07:07,129 --> 00:07:14,959
I've been better. I hope things get better. Oh

72
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:16,459
Hello

73
00:07:16,459 --> 00:07:18,409
How are you today?

74
00:07:18,409 --> 00:07:21,289
I've been better. How about you?

75
00:07:21,289 --> 00:07:26,539
I've been better. What's the news from the other parts of Tamriel?

76
00:07:26,539 --> 00:07:30,469
nothing, and I'd like to talk about

77
00:07:30,469 --> 00:07:32,149
So long

78
00:07:32,149 --> 00:07:36,309
Be seeing you at first. I thought it was the same guy. Just talking to himself

79
00:07:36,309 --> 00:07:43,300
But it's clearly the same voice actor for these two characters interacting. I've been better. How are you been better?

80
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:51,830
It's as long as like this same person or something. It's incredible. I already show this one, but it's so funny

81
00:07:51,830 --> 00:08:00,590
This guy's an absolute an absolute menace to society, I don't know you

82
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:07,670
Know it's this about. I don't know you and I don't

83
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:17,390
They they test this game at all and I don't care

84
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:22,210
Okay, we get it thank you that is literally me at school to everyone

85
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:28,750
I don't know you I don't care to know you Thank You Pat sir. The voice acting is just impeccable lady. Amber

86
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:37,190
Knox has hired a new captain lady. Amber. Knox has hired a new captain of the guard

87
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:38,450
Todd did that intentionally

88
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:42,860
I know he did Spriggans nature's Guardians my foot

89
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:47,870
Mean things they'll curse you or they might call a bear to tear you apart

90
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:55,520
Spriggans nature's Guardians my foot mean things they'll curse you or they might call a bear to tear you apart

91
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,760
wow, it's so nice to see a game that really

92
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:03,340
Articulates all the points that they want to say. It feels like I'm talking to a real person

93
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:06,230
Don't you feel it too smash like if you feel it, too

94
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:11,030
thank you something that's really innovative for video games is the fact that

95
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:15,730
Characters will actually remember their interaction with you like that one Lord of the Rings game

96
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:19,030
For example, that definitely does not occur in oblivion

97
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:23,510
I mean oblivion really lives up to his name because it seems like a blue everyone just having amnesia

98
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:28,190
I'm captain of the castle guard and Deon is captain of the town guard

99
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:36,320
It's simple I don't care what goes on in town. That's Dion's problem

100
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,170
Goodbye you're the gray fox

101
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:48,710
You're under arrest for for for all kinds of stuff. You're wanted dead or alive. I'm i'm choosing dead

102
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:56,360
I'll make captain for this. Oh great

103
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:03,680
Man down he was just a captain that wanted to be captain. So sad only asking for enough to

104
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,100
Thank you later. Gather

105
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,400
Blessings of the shadow upon

106

108
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:43,010
He was here a second ago you

109
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:47,450
I've seen your kind before you've got blood on your hands

110
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:55,730
Keep your blade sheath you murdering bastard, or I'll put you down myself

111
00:10:55,730 --> 00:11:00,890
Stay safe citizen say saves our dark times

112
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:16,100
You just murdered some wine, how could you do this spell looks dangerous keep your distance

113
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:24,500
Damnit will we ever get games like this anymore? I doubt it your money or your money or your life

114
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:32,180
You're smarter than you look seems fair they have braids in his hair

115
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:36,920
Take it it's worthless to me anyway

116
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,720
The whole video of me just

117
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,840
Goddamnit, I laughed at that how does that happen?

118
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:46,660
You see this highwayman at existential crisis after you stole from him

119
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:50,720
You see he makes a living stealing from others and yet he himself was just robbed

120
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:56,830
You can't say you were in the wrong since he's done worse. I mean, yeah, I guess he's just calling us worthless

121
00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:02,480
Isn't he because he was comparing our life to the money

122
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:09,320
Take it it's worthless to me. Anyway. Yeah. It's oddly like sad

123
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:15,950
But of course the top of the cake the cake of the cake the cake inside the cake the guards, of course

124
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:17,840
Nothing beats the AI

125
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:38,120
Anyway, okay oblivion really has mastered AI it doesn't get any cleverer the cleverer really smarter than this. What is it?

126
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,830
Very subtle

127
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:41,960
Stop right there criminal scum

128
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:51,380
Nobody breaks the law and my watch I'm confiscating your stolen goods now pay your fine or it's off to jail

129
00:12:51,380 --> 00:13:07,690
Then pay with your blood see my mascara watch out

130
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:16,540
Take the fuckin do well sir officer. She says all flesh and no fury. I can't tell you

131
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:28,000
It keeps stealing. So it's a perfect long live the Empire what's going on?

132
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:36,640
It's all over law breaker your sprees at an inner I'll take any stolen. Could you have the next move is yours?

133
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:42,580
Pay your fine or I'll haul you away

134
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:46,390
Then pay with your blood

135
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:50,560
It's all over Anakin I have the high ground

136
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,540
Alright, that's it guys going right to subscribe to bacon. I'll link his channel down below

137
00:13:55,540 --> 00:14:00,400
he is still uploading these I wouldn't be able to make this video without it and

138
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,510
Honestly, it's so funny. I I it's kind of weird

139
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:09,180
I I feel like I shouldn't play the game because I have this expectation in my head that every interaction is gonna be like this

140
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:12,810
Now because all I've ever seen from it, but if you guys wanted me to play the game

141
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,970
I think I would be up for I think it could be fun

142
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:21,089
I don't know. But if you enjoyed this video smash like and I'll see you guys tomorrow. Hope this video. It was enjoyable

143
00:14:21,089 --> 00:14:24,700
I'm sure it was. Thank you very much. Goodbye

144
