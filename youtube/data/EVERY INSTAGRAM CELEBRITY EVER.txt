00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,800
Wheat that woes!

00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:12,080
Okay, so the halter top tank top and Coachella headband bring you to $350

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,500
Will that be cash or credit?

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,960
Um..

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,400
I'm sorry. I thought you knew um, I'm Brittney Belson. I'm an influencer

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,860
So my offer is, I post a photo wearing these clothes maybe tag you

8
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:26,680
#WhateverYouGuysLike

9
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:29,590
And you give me these clothes for

10
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:31,300
$0. Oh

11
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,640
(Uh oh)

12
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,829
Right because you are an

13
00:00:35,829 --> 00:00:38,280
influencer, of course

14
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:45,100
Yeah, actually, let me connect you to our social media rep. Thank you!

15
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,560
ARGH!

16
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,920
Bye bye now!

17
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,399
every Instagram celebrity ever

18
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:55,020
How is this girl so famous on Instagram? I'm always seeing her my explore page

19
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:00,569
Oh, she's best friends with the cousin of the friend who's the mailman of the makeup artist for Kylie Jenner's dog.

20
00:01:00,569 --> 00:01:02,080
Oh.

21
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,620
Okay, I love her!

22
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:08,580
every &quot;take my selfie!&quot; ever

23
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,860
So your kidneys are completely failing Mr. Bogan

24
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:18,040
Now, I don't want to tell you what to do, but you need to make some major lifestyle changes. It says right here.

25
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:22,770
Your occupation is influencing, right? Yeah. Yeah, but do you get paid for that?

26
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:29,400
I don't exactly get paid in 'money'? But I do get a lot of free stuff real. Yeah, like lately

27
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,700
I've been surviving off this box of protein bars that I promoted last month

28
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,400
And then I also got a brand deal with this vegan facemask company, and those are sort of edible.

29
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,220
Anyway, you got a bathroom I can use? Oh for sure but we don't have any toilet paper.

30
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:48,520
Totally cool, I've been wipin' my a** with flat belly tea bags for the last six years.

31
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:54,240
I don't even follow people I just follow different parakeets

32
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:01,620
We're the first gym to have an area specifically designed for Instagram users such as yourself, let me know if you have any questions.

33
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:06,640
Oh. Cool thanks

34
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,220
Woah x6 What are you doing? I was just- In here?!

35
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:17,860
You're only allowed to work out your a**. Things like leg lifts or squats- way to go Karen- even butt shreds.

36
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:24,640
Way to go Devin. Ya get up in there! cakey boy butt bops and of course, PETER'S REVENGE. AHHHH.

37
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,900
The usual stuff. Yo, man. I just wanted normal looking body.

38
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:28,610
*disc scratches*

39
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:34,740
No one wants to see a normal looking body on Instagram. Not your grandma. Not God, not me. You disgust me

40
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35,510
*scream of agony*

41
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:37,510
Keep it up Steven.

42
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,170
*Steven dies*

43
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:44,780
Guys, I'm the top live right now and I'm totes making spaghetts.

44
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:53,780
Oh my god babe, they're living the dream. That could be us one day. Okay, one more picture and we should be good, babe.

45
00:02:53,780 --> 00:03:10,040
We're living the dream. (crying) I'm freaking lonely oh my god. I'm so lonely. (more crying) I use this arm for a lot of other things.

46
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,020
Follow for follow, huh

47
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,500
(breaking news audio)

48
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:22,800
A famous Instagram model known for her flawless selfies has been missing since last Sunday. Police believe it may be a kidnapping situation;

49
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:29,760
however, there will be no possible way of finding her because her use of Photoshop is so extensive on every photo that there will be

50
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:36,420
no way of recognizing her face in real life and if her body is found, no one will be able to identify it.

51
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:41,800
In other news, cupcakes are getting smaller *laughter*

52
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:46,860
I was verified and then I changed my name

53
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:52,230
Hey, you're Debbie you're that Instagram model who's like always outside in a bikini, right? Yeah, that's me

54
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:54,880
Haven't been inside for years. Spare some change?

55
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,620
What?

56
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:58,740
Oh

57
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:01,540
Are you always outside in your instagrams because you're..

58
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:05,900
Homeless? Yeah. Oh and are you always at the beach because..

59
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:10,220
The ocean is my shower? Yup

60
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:15,060
Yeah that's cool. You don't have to say it's cool, dude.

61
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:23,780
Chris Pratt follows Olivia and Courtney, but not me. What the hell?

62
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:28,760
Oh my god Britney Benson? You're like my favorite Instagram model. Aw thanks.

63
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:36,620
I just love how in every photo you're in a cool country, staying all these awesome hotels, adventuring with all these other attractive people?

64
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,940
It's so inspirational

65
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,190
How do you afford everything?

66
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:45,380
Well, it's pretty crazy what you can do and you just throw caution to the wind

67
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:51,440
I mean when I quit my job and decided to just travel all over the world,

68
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:57,800
I said yes to life and I didn't look ba- It's your dad's money, isn't it? Oh.

69
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,700
Yeah? Yeah..

70
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:06,720
(awkward...)

71
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,340
Every Instagram celebrity ever.

72
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:19,240
Okay, who is this girl and why she's so famous- Sorry I kicked over.. You kicked the lamp? Omg honestly, likes for days, am I right?

73
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,580
Breaking news: More time. I- I got it- I got it.

74
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,760
I don't know why I feel so weird that I'm declaring breaking news?

75
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:30,820
Breaking news. Breaking news. *sigh* Okay.

76
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:34,380
One day that could be us. One da-

77
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:37,880
One da (day) x2. Alright.

78
