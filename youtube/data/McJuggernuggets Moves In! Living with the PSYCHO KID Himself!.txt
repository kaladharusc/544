my Twitter streams my social media

6
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:10,830

7
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:12,929

8
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:15,240
friend of mine coming in to hang out and

9
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,130

00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,980
seen our original collaborations I hope

14
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,630
that you do I'll link to them down to

15
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:30,179
the description box below I really try

16
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:31,109
to keep things from getting in that

17
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:34,020
weird this time it's probably still

18
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,640
gonna get pretty weird so the room I'm

19
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,989
in right now is the one where I filmed

20
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:39,390
Francis gets abandoned by his sister I

21
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:41,640
have now redecorated it to make it look

22
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,350
a little more normal

23
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,629
the last time jessie was here this room

24
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:51,329
was not so normal um we've cleaned it up

25
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:53,340
nicely it's kind of got like a world of

26
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,829
warcraft' you know star wars kind of

27
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:58,020
theme to it look at it glowing stars

28
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,059
though sealing in that this is

29
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:01,199
definitely looks like a kid's room

30
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,719
doesn't fit that makes sense if you

31
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:04,860
think about it though buddy I think

32
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,659
