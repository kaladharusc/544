1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,850
alright guys it's time for my call of

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:09,450
duty black ops for impressions what the

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:13,380
hell I liked it I liked call of duty

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:21,380
black ops 4 beta I said I liked it Chuck

5
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:27,330
don't judge me what the cried I said hey

6
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,640
nobody wants to come over here and bash

7
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,850
on this more than I do alright but angry

8
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:34,739
Joe brings it to you straight

9
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:37,559
I'm always honest and I'm gonna give

10
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:39,360
credit where credit is due and I

11
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,090
actually like it and I think it's so

12
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:43,950
weird because among my friends and

13
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,770
youtubers that I've watched I feel like

14
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:49,710
the I'm the only one that liked it so

15
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:50,219
yeah

16
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:54,300
why well I liked this more than any

17
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,070
other Call of Duty at least the

18
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,480
multiplayer beta I'm talking about

19
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,520
multiplayer only I liked it more the

20
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,829
infinite warfare I liked the more than

21
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:04,080
advanced warfare I even liked it more

22
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,380
than World War 2 Call of Duty

23
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:08,850
multiplayer except for one mode that was

24
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:10,229
that was good that they were trying to

25
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:12,840
copy battlefield but I liked it and I

26
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,479
and I'm I think it's because there's two

27
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:17,970
new modes in their heist and control and

28
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:19,740
I really like these two and I was

29
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:20,939
playing these two over and over

30
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:23,040
especially control highs is cool but

31
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,369
it's essentially ripping off csgo if

32
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:27,960
everybody starts on an even playing

33
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,820
field part of the reason I like in

34
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,200
pistols and stuff and then you're

35
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,970
gaining money and you're purchasing new

36
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,159
weapons you're customizing and then

37
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:37,140
you're grabbing a cash bag that's the

38
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,670
twist you grab a cash bag and you

39
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,530
extract it so it's like a mixture of

40
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,750
multiple modes and didn't see us go and

41
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,369
I think even maybe even battlefield

42
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:48,180
hardline so yeah but again not not Call

43
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,549
of Duty like right but this game

44
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:54,000
actually plays differently from Call of

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,570
Duty's because I'm liking it it plays

46
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,850
more like Rainbow six siege you know

47
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:02,189
with these operator abilities placeable

48
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:04,920
terrain the freaking and obstacles and

49
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,170
shields and stuff like that this game

50
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,720
plays more like overwatch with unique

51
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,970
character perks this game plays more

52
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:13,780
like destiny with higher time

53
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,010
to kill and that's what people have been

54
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,620
bitching so much about I watched so many

55
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,840
videos with lose fucker goal duty sucks

56
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,459
of time to kill is way too high

57
00:02:21,459 --> 00:02:23,350
that's because it fucking makes it more

58
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:27,040
tactical it forces you to use your brain

59
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,190
and think of decisions and come out the

60
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,360
situations differently instead of the

61
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,100
normal Call of Duty with a chicken with

62
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:33,550
your head

63
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:35,440
rotting running around with the chicken

64
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,910
your head is cut off and you're the

65
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,319
first one to see is the first one to

66
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,480
kill the fucking twitch shooter scene to

67
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,030
the extreme this one actually requires

68
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,920
that you work with your teammates at

69
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,660
least in these two fucking modes heist

70
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:50,019
and control for sure and I actually even

71
00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:52,060
liked the team deathmatch the hardpoint

72
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,040
the other modes of the five or five or

73
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,320
six modes two of them really liked the

74
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,120
other ones I could actually tolerate

75
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,920
more than the previous Call of Duty's

76
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,750
because it kind of translates a little

77
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,090
bit into there but then that's when you

78
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,319
start when you're in the team down there

79
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:06,819
that's when you start to see what the

80
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:08,830
fuck you guys talking about the time to

81
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,690
kill is so high you have you said the

82
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,480
COS come Koskov which is like this

83
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,600
Russian looking advanced sniper it's

84
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,940
it's so it's one-hit kill from the waist

85
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,769
up you shoot somebody the fucking dead

86
00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:22,329
laughter dance BAM they're dead and

87
00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:24,700
people are using fucking 50 cals and

88
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,130
just getting like four rapid-fire kills

89
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:30,549
even i angry Joe's fucking terrible at

90
00:03:30,549 --> 00:03:33,220
this game dominate hit with these

91
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:54,510
weapons look holy fuck holy fuck holy

92
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:58,129
smoke checked

93
00:03:58,129 --> 00:04:09,739
good to see it made me feel so good

94
00:04:09,739 --> 00:04:12,150
maybe something is really wrong with

95
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,129
call of duty because if angry Joe's

96
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:17,160
enjoying the game play and is dominating

97
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,900
then you guys are right then call duty

98
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:22,470
is fucking broken no no it's actually

99
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,570
entertaining for me and and ELLs

100
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:26,130
disappoint when he does disappoint him

101
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:28,110
with me but I'm telling you maybe it was

102
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,400
because I was playing with good players

103
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,370
or I just had a bunch of sets of good

104
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:33,990
games but I had more fun with this one

105
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:36,599
than I have then the past for Call of

106
00:04:36,599 --> 00:04:40,470
Duty games so but but ok so all that

107
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:44,520
positivity is out there and it plays

108
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,590
more like and maybe here's why I like it

109
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,419
because it plays more like all the games

110
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:50,810
it's trying to copy then Call of Duty

111
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:53,340
you know it obviously still feels very

112
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,889
much rooted in Call of Duty with the

113
00:04:55,889 --> 00:04:59,400
little you know sort of fast intense

114
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,060
small Maps intense matches it's got the

115
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,860
really good you know Call of Duty gun

116
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:08,430
progression as you unlock stuff you know

117
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:12,060
but it feels more tactical and you can

118
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:15,240
actually win out one on one verse good

119
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,669
players it's not just whoever sees you

120
00:05:17,669 --> 00:05:21,479
each other first and dies and you have

121
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:22,680
to work with your teammates so that's

122
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,099
what I liked about it but I have to

123
00:05:26,099 --> 00:05:27,780
remind myself here it's time to get

124
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,479
serious though this beta was fucking

125
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:35,099
free ok and and I'm over here yeah epic

126
00:05:35,099 --> 00:05:37,409
victory for Call of Duty really liked

127
00:05:37,409 --> 00:05:39,449
the multiplayer more than previous ones

128
00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:42,750
but and and and he doesn't absolutely

129
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,759
hate and despise this year's Call of

130
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:46,699
Duty and roll his eyes when he playing

131
00:05:46,699 --> 00:05:51,630
yay epic victory right no because I

132
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:54,060
think that that's what should have been

133
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,639
happening in in the previous four games

134
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,979
you know that's the bare minimum and you

135
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:02,190
should be having fun and after the beta

136
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:04,740
like almost prestiged in a single day

137
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,930
like I'm almost kind of done playing

138
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:09,570
with it in a day or two and so I don't

139
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,490
think that this called

140
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:13,919
dooty let me think about it this is all

141
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:14,639
there is

142
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,220
except multiplay there's no singleplayer

143
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,349
they fucking gutted that out of the game

144
00:06:19,349 --> 00:06:22,199
so what I flayed is at the lowest base

145
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:25,650
price $60 is that worth it fuck no you

146
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:27,930
know and you look on here is it it is do

147
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:30,180
I actually like it enough to pay 100 and

148
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:33,630
fucking $20 fuckin oh that's a total

149
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:36,479
ripoff that's fucking insulting nothing

150
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,190
about this digital edition I think it's

151
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,199
like 80 or something it's more expensive

152
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,780
than the base hell no again are you

153
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,569
fucking kidding me Activision like ice

154
00:06:45,569 --> 00:06:48,599
it blows me away that the Call of Duty

155
00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:51,990
faithful just like eat this shit up and

156
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:55,229
they don't like fight back like with

157
00:06:55,229 --> 00:06:58,560
battlefront 2 Star Wars fans like the

158
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,990
game looks so the game looks the same

159
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:03,389
why is it that it looks like infinite

160
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:04,979
warfare advanced warfare just without

161
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:06,680
the jetpacks thankfully there's no

162
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,690
jetpacks and jumping off walls and shit

163
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,370
but it looks the fucking same it looks

164
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:14,669
like muddy and when the hell are they

165
00:07:14,669 --> 00:07:16,800
gonna evolve the fucking engine and

166
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,280
system you're paying more for less no

167
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,990
matter what excuse and I've seen so many

168
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:23,729
get I'm getting more zombies when I

169
00:07:23,729 --> 00:07:25,289
played 100 hours of zombie some it's

170
00:07:25,289 --> 00:07:26,550
good for me if it's good for you then

171
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:29,490
get buy it buy it but I but zombies I'm

172
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,800
fucking done with zombies it's doesn't

173
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,990
sell Call of Duty's for me anymore the

174
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:37,380
zombies mode okay okay so you don't need

175
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,180
me to tell you to go out and buy it or

176
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,949
that the games worth the price cuz it's

177
00:07:40,949 --> 00:07:43,830
not it is not worth the fucking price

178
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,169
yes I had fun but I should be having fun

179
00:07:46,169 --> 00:07:48,509
and all we've done is gone back to you

180
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,909
know four games ago or modern warfare 2

181
00:07:50,909 --> 00:07:53,580
black ops 2 3 where were you actually

182
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,990
having a little bit of fun and

183
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:57,000
multiplayer instead of rolling your eyes

184
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,180
out of the back of your head and I like

185
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,699
how not every single operator ability is

186
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:05,699
a lethal thing there's ones that allow

187
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:08,009
you to see the map there's a shield guy

188
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:09,569
which is the guy that I use a lot

189
00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:11,610
because I die a lot so I need that

190
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:13,740
shield and I feel like so freakin

191
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,659
powerful and stuff when that shield

192
00:08:15,659 --> 00:08:17,370
comes up there's a nuclear guy where you

193
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:21,449
can you know try to siege an area you

194
00:08:21,449 --> 00:08:23,550
know how people get so strong in a

195
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:24,960
little area and there's

196
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,850
way to stop him just come through the

197
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:29,069
walls you could do this radiation which

198
00:08:29,069 --> 00:08:31,680
like cooks emits it's so cool so they've

199
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,500
got some cool things in there and as

200
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,270
much fun as I had I don't think that

201
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,740
people gonna be playing this much next

202
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:40,200
year but I don't think it has longer

203
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,469
legs to stand on even though I did sort

204
00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:46,860
of enjoy it so while I am positive on

205
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,570
the game plan I did have fun in the

206
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:53,130
second weekend of the beta on PC I still

207
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:54,270
don't think is where there's gonna be

208
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,430
interesting I'm gonna try to review it

209
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,500
there's so many games in broke Tober I'm

210
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,510
putting much more emphasis in time on

211
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,980
battlefield 5 because that game actually

212
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,020
puts fucking shit in their game and they

213
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,580
don't fucking half-ass it like Call of

214
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,040
Duty guys this year so I'll try my best

215
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,690
to review both but it's gonna be hard

216
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:11,100
especially with all the other games

217
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,110
coming out in October so there it is

218
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:15,810
Call of Duty is the plays differently

219
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:17,399
from so many other Call of Duty's

220
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:18,899
because they're trying to rip off every

221
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:21,570
other game but their own and Joe likes

222
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:23,670
it a little bit more of the normal in

223
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:26,399
multiplayer only without what when it's

224
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,060
free alright so yeah guys that's why

225
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:33,360
quick beta impressions thank you so much

226
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,610
for watching I'm very curious to see how

227
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:36,990
people react to this probably gonna get

228
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:38,279
downloaded to hell because I said

229
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:41,000
something positive about call of duty

230
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,680
but it's it's it sucks because it is

231
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,839
something it's a small nugget of

232
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,800
positive in an epic mound just this

233
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,850
fucking shit ball of garbage practices

234
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:56,610
lazy design and battle royale and

235
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:59,160
overcharging people you know if they can

236
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,079
if they put the single-player and if

237
00:10:01,079 --> 00:10:02,790
they actually evolve to their game if

238
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,380
they upgraded the graphics engine

239
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,730
upgrade of the whole fucking engine

240
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,560
that's another thing so did they make

241
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,660
good on their PC promise I'm not almost

242
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:13,350
done judging by the beta it was a beta

243
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:14,880
so I can't give a final review but that

244
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,640
shit was so buggy it was it crashed all

245
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,829
the time the whole thing would freeze

246
00:10:19,829 --> 00:10:23,060
any time there's an electrical you know

247
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:26,190
texture or effect some of the operator

248
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:28,440
effects freeze my whole system sometimes

249
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,089
crash my own system so it's very

250
00:10:30,089 --> 00:10:33,510
unstable and and so while it was

251
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:35,430
supposedly dedicated servers players

252
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:37,110
can't run their own dedicated services

253
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,640
like dedicated servers but it's

254
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,080
felt like peer-to-peer because there

255
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,330
were so many crashes and so many hitches

256
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:47,310
and lag you know so yeah it does feel a

257
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:49,200
tiny bit better like it's not just a

258
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,600
console port but there's a lot of you

259
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,070
know technical issues that need to be

260
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:54,990
ironed out before release and there's

261
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:57,030
time and I do hope that they do the

262
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:59,700
Battle Royale beta and I'll definitely

263
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,640
play this this has earned enough fun and

264
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,410
entertainment because almost past Alfred

265
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:06,570
plane I was playing so much that I'll

266
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:08,340
definitely check out the Battle Royale

267
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,920
beta and see why the hell they need to

268
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,440
charge $60 for that alright alright guys

269
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,200
that's it I'll see you on the next angry

270
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:22,460
Joe show bye guys
