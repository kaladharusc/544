I gotta repair it easy I've been playing

23

a lot of video games and I've been

24
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,280
spending a lot of time planning videos

25
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,869
that are like bigger production

26
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:51,989

00:01:51,989 --> 00:01:54,390
gonna learn all about soon I haven't

28
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,160
done a production this complicated since

29
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:00,300
well before I started vlogging on my way

30
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,340
to the airport still doing this kind of

31
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:07,979
a lot and I'm still back at the airport

32
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:10,360
getting back back at the airport

33
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,630
[Music]

00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:16,190
so yeah not like a whole whole lot has

35
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:18,200
changed but then we're like a million

36
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,120
more questions about exactly what I'm up

37
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:24,860
to at CNN so

38
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,770
[Music]

39
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:29,140

right there so we're here for a day when

43
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:41,620
I say we I mean the entire beam team is

44
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,830
here in Atlanta with me

45
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:48,190
CNN HQ beam team and this trip is just

46
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,930
to meet some of the CNN staff like a lot

47
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:51,220
of the tech people are here in Atlanta

48
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,290
just wanted to come down here for a day

49
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:55,150
say hello get to know them you guys look

50
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,160
awesome so yeah in the video that I

51
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,630
posted last week where I explained that

52
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:01,960
I sold my company beam to CNN and I'm

53
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,360
gonna be working for CNN now I gave zero

54
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,160
explanation all I said is I don't know

55
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,410
what we're doing and that's completely

56
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:10,840
true but there is a lot of context that

57
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,310
I can share with you that I haven't

58
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:14,200
shared with you making a video every day

59
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,910
on YouTube presented all kinds of

60
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,890
opportunities and as I was assessing

61
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:19,330
those opportunities like what do I want

62
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:21,580
next for my own career I realized in

63
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,770
order for me to go to the next level I

64
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,120
needed to do things that were bigger

65
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,060
than just me I needed more resources

66
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:31,120
than I personally had access to as the

67
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,590
YouTube channel and the vlog just

68
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:35,830
exploded the opportunities became like I

69
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:38,920
wanted something much bigger and now I

70
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,050
had access to it one of the companies I

71
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:43,450
met with was CNN and they were just as

72
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:45,190
excited about working with me from a

73
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:47,800
media perspective like a video TV

74
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,080
YouTube everything perspective as they

75
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,760
were about what we could do from a

76
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,490
technology perspective with the squad at

77
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:56,650
beam and I should say at first I was

78
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,330
like this is never but as the

79
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:00,040
conversations progressed I realized just

80
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,250
how perfect of an opportunity this is

81
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,950
exactly what I've been looking for beam

82
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:07,330
and there are a lot of misconceptions

83
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,800
about this but being first of all beam

84
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,840
is a company we're a technology company

85
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,550
were a software development company and

86
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,440
we're definitely more than just the one

87
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,750
app that we launched last year and that

88
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,549
app we had a really successful launch

89
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:20,290
but the app like you know we didn't

90
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:22,570
compete with snapchat that's why we're

91
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:24,430
shutting down the app now but there's a

92
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,260
difference between the app and the

93
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,960
company itself in CNN was very attracted

94
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,060
to the company itself and it was the app

95
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,620
that demonstrated what we were capable

96
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:35,950
of as a technology company one very

97
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,360
important distinction here and there's a

98
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,270
lot of misinformation about this

99
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,800
online especially in other people's

100
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,540
YouTube videos who seem to just kind of

101
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,070
be guessing all the intimacy's of this

102
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:47,760
deal this was expressly not an aqua hire

103
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,270
this is not a situation where CNN hired

104
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:53,370
all of the or some of the employees of

105
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:55,290
my tech company so they could use this

106
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:56,850
guy over here to work on their website

107
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:58,440
and this guy to work on their mobile app

108
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,210
and beam the company we are staying

109
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:02,460
together we are not leaving offices

110
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,320
we're still gonna be operating on a team

111
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,000
headquarters right here in downtown

112
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,800
Manhattan in fact we're gonna be

113
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,720
expanding and hiring more people to work

114
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,460
out of this space right here

115
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,680
not one team member left the company not

116
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,210
one person was asked to leave the

117
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:17,310
company not one person asked to leave

118
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:19,440
the company we are staying together as

119
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,240
the cohesive team we have always been

120
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,700
focused on building technology and very

121
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,260
in line with the mission that we've

122
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,940
always subscribed to as a company the

123
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,400
difference now is that we're going to be

124
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,930
merging what I've been doing in the

125
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,120
media space that is YouTube and what I

126
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,430
did in films and what I did in TV and my

127
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,870
whole knowledge of the media space and

128
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,000
then what we've done in the technology

129
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,920
space we're gonna put them together and

130
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,380
create a new company and we're operating

131
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,480
autonomously we are downtown CNN's

132
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,580
uptown we are downtown CNN's here in

133
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,820
Atlanta we have total freedom to create

134
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,190
whatever we want to create and now we

135
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:55,140
have that freedom with the vast

136
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:58,500
resources of CNN and look I know I

137
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,300
didn't answer any specifics as to how

138
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,040
we're gonna do that and that's what I

139
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,420
met in last week's video and I just kept

140
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:04,650
saying I don't know what we're doing

141
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:06,780
because we haven't defined the wooped

142
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,880
and we're gonna take the next three five

143
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,070
six months to really figure that out but

144
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,710
that's the broader thing like that is

145
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:15,840
what this whole acquisition that is what

146
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,210
this entire thing is about the last

147
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:19,950
thing that was like falsely reported

148
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:20,970
ever I don't know where people get their

149
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:23,580
facts on YouTube but this YouTube

150
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,190
channel is mine this is my channel to do

151
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:28,080
whatever I want with CNN did not buy

152
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,700
this channel from a business perspective

153
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,440
from an Adsense perspective from a

154
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,240
creative perspective this channel will

155
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,950
be my channel to do whatever I want

156
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,990
including vlog if I decide I want to

157
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:39,900
vlog in or whatever and again I just

158
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,390
think that speaks to the confidence that

159
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:45,540
CNN has in us to build something they

160
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:48,060
didn't want this they want what's next

161
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,160
and that was a huge part of what was so

162
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,230
exciting for me so I hope that makes

163
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:55,290
sense I hope that adds a little a little

164
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,780
color to what I'm up to

165
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:01,020
I'm excited I cannot remember the last

166
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:04,290
