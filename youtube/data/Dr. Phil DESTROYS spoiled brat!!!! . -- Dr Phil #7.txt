1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,640
You know what no one likes?

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:02,640
'Pewdiepie'

3
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:03,800
SHUTTHEFUCKUPPP

4
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:04,300
K A B O O M !

5
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:05,740
Spoiled little kids!

6
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:06,720
No one likes em'...

7
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,280
It's time for Dr. Phil to

8
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,100
D E S T R O Y

9
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:13,140
COMPLETELY ANNIHILATE these spoiled brats.

10
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:14,960
This kid is called Gabriela.

11
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:22,640
She's 14 years old, she drinks, she smokes, some-uh-something, and she likes to do whatever she wants.

12
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,760
Mom: -crack at her I challenge-

13
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,720
Man: But you're breaking the law. Woman: Okay.

14
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,040
Mom: *Mumbling*
Gabriela: Oh no-

15
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,160
Dr. Phil: What did you just say? x2

16
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,360
Mom: Ugh, she's worse than I am.

17
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,140
Dr Phil: What'd you say?

18
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,300
Gabriela: I said &quot;Oh no&quot;

19
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,680
Dr Phil: Oh, so you think this is a joke?

20
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,280
Little Brat: Yes!

21
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,120
Savage Phil: Okay, you think this is a joke, 'cause this is not gonna be funny in about 5 minutes.

22
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,300
Savage Phil: Okay, you think this is a joke, 'cause this is not gonna be funny in about 5 minutes.
Guy: She's scared. x2

23
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,520
Guy: She's scared. x2

24
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,120
Dr. Phil is gonna kill her.

25
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,120
*laughs*

26
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,800
DR. PHIL IS GONNA DESTROY! YEAH, GET 'EM DR. PHIL!

27
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:59,520
As always, kids don't just become psycho by themselves, there's always a parent involved to lead them down that path.

28
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,760
This time, it's the mom.

29
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,000
Gabriela: *crying* It's not his fault!
Mom: It's not his fault, it's not his fault. And-

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,760
Man: It's both of you, both of you did not love her enough.

31
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,680
Both: WOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWW

32
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,320
Mom: That's messed up maaan.
Gabriela: You guys are so sad!

33
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,320
wOOOOOOWWWWWWWWW

34
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,680
WOOOOOWWW

35
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,680
So, &quot;What is really happening here Felix?&quot;

36
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,960
Don't worry. I will explain. Alright?

37
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:26,500
Grandmother: I wrote in to Dr. Phil because I was so 'worried' about what's going on with my granddaughter.

38
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:30,100
What's going on completely terrifies me.

39
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,760
The grandma is concerned about her granddaughter.

40
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,940
What does she do? Contact the authorities? Maybe try and get some help?

41
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,620
OR CALL DOCTOR PHIL!

42
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,440
*clap* x4

43
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,980
God bless this grandma, she knew what the right thing to do was.

44
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:48,400
Ridicule her online, which will stay there forever, or just settle things privately.

45
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,460
Somebody had better do something around here!!

46
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:54,260
There's something VERY wrong with this picture.

47
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:59,040
Sorry, I agree 100%... IS THAT A CAN OF BEANS?!

48
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,440
ZOOM IN ON THAT CAN... IS THAT BEANS?! That's gotta be beans!

49
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,880
Someone stop the bean meme, PLEASE!

50
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,060
She's just trolling, I knew it.

51
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,740
I feel that Gabriela NEEDS to be taken away from her mother-

52
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:16,200
The bottom line is, when I think of what Kaylie has done to Gabriela, I hope she goes to jail.

53
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,380
Pewds: Daaaaamn!

54
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:21,960
Dr. Phil: You've been listening to our conversation so far.

55
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,620
Grandma: Yes I have.

56
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:29,420
Dr. Phil: And you actually wrote in, and asked for me to get involved in this situation.

57
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:38,360
Dr Phil: What was the prime driver? What made you- What was the primary thing that made you write in?

58
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,940
*Money*

59
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:40,900
*Money*
The views, okay.

60
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:41,960
*chuckle*

61
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,760
Pewds: That's a great question, by the way. Why did you-

62
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,340
Why did you contact-

63
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:49,220
I never understand. They surely must get paid for this.

64
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,080
Why would you write Dr. Phil?

65
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,660
If you can afford your own psychiatrist.

66
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,880
Why is Dr. Phil like the last resort?

67
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,480
I mean I enjoy it! I'll take it! I just don't get it.

68
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,040
Grandma: I love my granddaughter.

69
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,080
Pewds: No y- *stutters and laughs*

70
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,460
??? ?????

71
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:08,060
Grandmama: *cries* I love her to pieces.

72
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:12,440
Grandma: And I've seen, what SHE has done to her.

73
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:20,420
She's a loving, caring person. And I've watched it- and I've watched WHAT YOU'VE DONE TO HER!!

74
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,660
Grandma: YOU HAVE MESSED HER UP!!!

75
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,920
Kaylie: *sarcastically*  I'm so sorry.
?????????? ??

76
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,900
?????????? ??

77
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:29,360
*claps x8*
That's a great pause right there. Very nice.

78
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,060
So, what is wrong with the mom?

79
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,840
Well, let's just jUmP iNtO iT!

80
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,840
Let's just get into... the mother. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

81
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,560
Surely, she can't be that bad. What can she do that would be such a big deal?

82
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,960
CJ (Father): Five months after Kaylie and I had separated, Gabriel had come home and she dropped a big bomb.

83
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,960
She was eleven years old at the time.

84
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,840
Kaylie: I explained to my daughter I was a professional dominatrix.

85
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,380
(......)

86
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,820
S'cuse me?
*chuckles*

87
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:54,640
Could you say that again??

88
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,780
CJ: She was 11 years old at the time.

89
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:59,280
Kaylie: I explained to my daughter, that I was a professional dominatrix.

90
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,520
Pewds: She's a domi- what?

91
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,100
The ones that like to... wear the thing...?

92
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,480
And spank the thing??

93
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,760
50 Shades Of Things????

94
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,620
Okay, that seems like an appropriate thing to tell your... eleven year old daughter.

95
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,700
I don't see why not.

96
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:14,040
CJ: She's been drinking alcohol. She and Gabriel were smoking pot together.

97
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,500
My daughter has also been sexually active.

98
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,920
Kaylie: Sex is a natural thing.

99
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,900
We eat, we use the bathroom, we shower, and we have sex!

100
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,080
It's not a big deal.

101
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:30,880
Dr. Phil: Your wife has become a dominatrix, and you send your daughter to live with her!

102
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,020
Dr. Phil: I get here this morning,

103
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:35,000
And, they're telling me, that over the weekend,

104
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,480
Three security guards are standing outside your hotel door!

105
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:45,680
You had been very loud, smoking marijuana, disturbing other guests, and threw a... used, feminine product-

106
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,820
Pewds:  wHAT?

107
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:50,820
Feminine product? What is he referring to?
(a tampon)

108
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,020
Dr. Phil: So, when you arrive at the main-

109
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:55,280
Pewds: I love these reactions that they added in.

110
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,480
Dr. Phil: So, when you arrive-
*weird pewdiepie gasping noises*

111
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,760
Do they just tell people in the audience to make silly faces?

112
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,760
I mean surely that's not that shocking,

113
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,260
I don't think a lot of people that made me-- a lot of things that made me go-

114
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,060
Except when I really yawn. *laughs*

115
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,740
Up top, everybody!

116
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,740
Smash like on this video if you yawn.

117
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:15,700
Dr. Phil: In the west building, the next afternoon, with your daughter, and apologized and admit

118
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:19,360
that you and Gabrielle just got high last night.

119
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:25,160
And then, braless, you pull out your breast in front of the staff in the lobby-

120
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:25,680
Pewdiepie: What??

121
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,180
Kaylie: Yeah...

122
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:30,160
Dr Phil: -and explain: &quot;I sometimes get naked when I get irritated.&quot;

123
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,160
Pewdiepie: What!!???
Kaylie: Yeah...

124
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,280
Pewdiepie: *quoting woman* &quot;I sometimes get naked when I'm irritated&quot;.

125
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,520
As you do. x2
*laughs*

126
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,140
Sometimes I take a poop when I'm tired

127
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,340
Dr Phil: You smoke marijuana with her?

128
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,080
Kaylie: Yeah, we smoke before we meditate.

129
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:43,740
Come, uh... come take a look!

130
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:44,300
Come, uh... come take a look!
Dr Phill: Well, okay, I will. Oh, she's here.

131
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,960
Dr Phill: Well, okay. I will. Oh, she's here.

132
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:51,020
Pewdiepie: So, let's hear, from Gabrielle, what this relationship is like.

133
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:54,520
Gabrielle: My dad really does want me to act like some typical white girl.

134
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,400
It's just not me...

135
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,400
*Pewdiepie laughs*

136
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,380
*Imitating Gabrielle* &quot;My dad just wants me to be a typical white girl~&quot;.

137
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,760
*lifts shirt*

138
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,760
It's just not me.
*laughs*

139
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,520
Gabrielle: I started having sex about a year ago.

140
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,380
I feel like I'm completely mature enough to be in a sexual relationship, just because I have all the-

141
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,240
Pewds: Oh lookadit!!
I feel like I'm completely mature enough to be in a sexual relationship, just because I have all the-

142
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,280
I feel like I'm completely mature enough to be in a sexual relationship, just because I have all-

143
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,280
Pewdiepie: It's so funny, they're always so delusional.

144
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,080
All kids are stupid, okay.... There's nothing wrong with it.

145
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,080
It's just when they're especially stupid, that it becomes funny.

146
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,840
Gabrielle: I love my mom's work. I so respect my mom's work.

147
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:30,140
and I so treasure my mom's work, only because of the way her eyes light up when she talks to me about it.

148
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:35,480
Pewdiepie: Wait... she likes that her mom is a dominatrix, because her eyes lit up when she talks about it?

149
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:40,900
HEY KID! Let me tell you about my job... I SpAnK people! Okay?

150
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,500
So great, sharing your passions with your daughter.

151
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,640
ᵒʰ ᵐʸ ᵍᵒᵈ

152
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,680
I feel bad for the daughter, I really do.

153
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,500
Like, she deserves better parents.

154
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:53,940
CJ: Gabrielle is a teenager, she's a young lady. This is beyond inappropriate. It's crazy!

155
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,940
Kaylie: Some people might say that I'm a prostitute!

156
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,620
CJ said that I'm a self-made whore.

157
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,920
I love what I do, and I don't care what anybody thinks...

158
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,700
Much less CJ.

159
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:09,260
Pewdiepie: Well you just reiterated what he said, so therefore, you do care.

160
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,840
Aha- point, proven, wrong. Ha-

161
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,280
Owned libtard.

162
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,260
Kaylie: I'd like to address your understanding of my profession.

163
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,240
Dr. Phil: Okay...

164
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:22,460
Kaylie: So, while what I do is sexual in nature, it's not sexual in... work.

165
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:25,320
It's about the idea of that.

166
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:29,120
And it's a very deep subject so it's probably... another topic but-

167
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,880
Pewds: It's a very deep topic, the topic of dominatrix.

168
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,500
You wouldn't possibly understand Dr. Phil.

169
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,480
Maybe we could come back later and we could discuss this.

170
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,480
You're here for your daughter, okay?

171
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,720
Just get that right. No one cares.

172
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:50,240
Kaylie: It's about... um... fantasy. Does that make sense?

173
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,680
Dr. Phill: I'll take your word for it.

174
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,160
*audience laughs*

175
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,580
Pewdiepie: Come on, Doctor. You know- you know exactly- *snickers*

176
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,580
I know what goes on in the Dr. Phil house.

177
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:01,140
Kaylie: My daughter understands what it is-

178
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,680
and it's, uh- It's important.

179
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,860
Pewds: Why? What's Important about it?

180
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,660
Why is it important for your daughter to know about it? It's so weird!

181
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:12,300
Dr. Phil: You have your daughter right now and where do you live?

182
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:15,320
Kaylie: We don't really live
anywhere, we've been waiting for my

183
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:19,960
settlement from CJ to get our new place,
and so now, we've just been with different friends.

184
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,900
Pewds: This is what happens
when you marry a thot.

185
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,360
Okay, a bad thot.

186
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,460
It like a bad, bad (incoherent). You never truly recovered from them.

187
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,420
Dr. Phil: You smoked marijuana with her.

188
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:32,280
Kaylie: I do now yeah, we smoke before
we meditate- when we meditate together.

189
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:38,920
Pewds: So the mom explains why she lets her smoke weed, and it's basically because at least then

190
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:43,880
she'll know that it's nothing bad, in the
weed. Besides, you know, like if you buy it

191
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,000
on the street you can sometimes-- I don't
know anything about this okay! so

192
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,680
just- I don't know. That's her philosophy at least.

193
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,580
Dr. Phil: Now she's 14!

194
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,840
Kaylie: I agree, and- *sigh*

195
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:59,660
Pewds: I agree! She is 14. I agree. I guess- I suppose we can agree that she is 14 years old.

196
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,660
This whole weed issue however-

197
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:08,920
Kaylie: I tried to find a way to talk to her a way she'd hear me, and try to get on board with me, because...

198
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:12,640
if I tell- even if I tell her, 
&quot;Listen I don't think- I don't want a video of that-

199
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,400
I don't want you posting that. I don't want-&quot;

200
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:18,360
Well she'll do it behind my back. x2 So-

201
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,520
Dr. Phil: But you're smoking dope with your daughter at a concert!

202
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,580
Kaylie: I wasn't smoking that.

203
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,960
Dr. Phil: She- You're with your daughter smoking dope at a concert
Kaylie: Yeah she was-

204
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,500
Kaylie: -smoking and we were at the concert. Yeah.

205
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,280
Pewds: *pfft*

206
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:32,220
So her excuses that she'll just do it anyway. She's out of control. I can't control her.

207
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:36,000
&quot;But you're doing it right next to her!&quot; The mom's response,

208
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,600
*Imitating the mom* &quot;Uh, well, I wasn't doing it. It was my daughter who was smoking, not me! I would never!&quot;

209
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,180
Gabriele: I feel my mom and I are like twins. We're so much alike!

210
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:49,640
We're identical, we have the same
thoughts!

211
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,460
Pewds: 'Cause you both are. Ha ha! Get it?

212
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:57,240
Did I just call a 14 year old a thot? I
didn't- That joke came out wrong, okay?

213
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,630
It worked for a half a second. Okay, I'll
take it.

214
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:03,260
Gabriel: I feel like I'm completely mature
enough to be in a sexual relationship-

215
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:07,140
just because I have all this knowledge
and understanding.

216
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:11,700
Pewds: I just have so much knowledge and understanding at the age of 14.

217
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:17,020
*mocking Gabriel* My mind- I am very smart. My mind, VERY big.

218
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,600
A bOoGa rOoGa DoO

219
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,880
My mom teach me very important lessons about life.

220
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:25,580
*intimidating Kaylie* Hey kid, you want to hear more about th-the spanking?

221
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:28,860
Dr. Phil: How do you describe a polyamorous relationship?

222
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,000
*sigh*

223
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,200
Gabriele: A relationship where, two people love each other-

224
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,060
but have sexual relations with other people.

225
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:36,760
Dr. Phil: Okay,

226
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,940
Pewds: Wait, Isn't that an open relationship?

227
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,220
Poly is when you love more than one person right?

228
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,840
*Reading* 'Ability or capacity to love more than one person at a time-

229
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,420
You're talking
about an open relatio-

230
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:54,560
Dr. Phil: So, you're in a polyamorous relationship because... You say, &quot;how can one person give you everything&quot;

231
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,260
Gabriel: Yeah.

232
00:10:55,260 --> 00:11:07,100
Dr. Phil: You're 14, which- does that seem... to you... young to be sexually active in a relationship?

233
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:11,110
Gabriel: No, because according to everybody else in this room

234
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:15,499
and everybody on the planet, they have
their own stereotypes, their own

235
00:11:15,499 --> 00:11:19,399
statistics for how things are 'supposed
to be'. The way the things are supposed to be.

236
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:22,700
You're supposed to do this at this
age, and this at this age, and you can't

237
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:27,480
do these things when you're this age because... Why? Why can't I do these things, Dr. Phil?

238
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,380
Dr. Phil: Wow that's pretty judgmental. You just

239
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,300
Dr. Phil: Wow that's pretty judgmental. You just
Kaylie: You're judgmental.

240
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:35,930
judged everybody in this room, and you
don't know a-one of them-

241
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:39,760
Gabrielle: The whole point of this show is to judge me; it's for everybody to sit back and judge me.

242
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,200
Kaylie: Yeah, that's the one she's talking about.

243
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,800
CJ: The whole point of the show isn't to judge you, the whole point of the show is to get you some help!

244
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,760
*applause*
Pewds: OH! That's a clap,

245
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,520
*clap x3* That's a clap. *snicker*

246
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,400
I love these kids who think they have figured out the entire world.

247
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,640
And you had this stupid mom who enables it as well.

248
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,040
&quot;She's so woke, what can I say, she's so woke&quot;.

249
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:04,680
So, the 'Philling' goes on, or the- Philling, drilling, get it?

250
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:09,200
Got really good jokes today, I really- I'm really Philling it. *chuckles*  And Gabrielle and her mom are getting

251
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,920
a little... they're getting a little irritated. They're getting a little impatient.

252
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,400
The bubble is about to drop!
Just keep watching.

253
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:26,280
Dr. Phil: By definition of the law, your daughter is not capable of giving consent.

254
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,320
Kaylie: Mhm.

255
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,960
Pewds: *mocking Kaylie* Mhm, I'm listening.
 
Dr: Phil: Because before she reaches a certain age, that's why we have laws for specific work-

256
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,120
Dr: Phil: Because before she reaches a certain age, that's why we have laws for specific work-

257
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,640
Pewds: Are we talking about dominatrix?
 
Dr: Phil: Because before she reaches a certain age, that's why we have laws for specific work-

258
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:40,069
When a child is a certain age, they don't have the capacity to give consent.

259
00:12:40,069 --> 00:12:46,220
That's why adults... are charged with
making those decisions for them and

260
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:50,560
protecting them; you're supposed to be
able to see around corners.

261
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:55,720
And when you say, &quot;I'm giving her dope, because all kids smoke dope anyway&quot;,

262
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,800
that's absolutely, unequivocally untrue!

263
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,700
Kaylie: Yes.

264
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,960
*applause*
Pewds: Yess!

265
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,200
*applause*
Dr. Phil: Well, look-

266
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,080
*applause*
Kaylie: *mumbling*

267
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,000
*applause*
Dr Phill: Listen, You can roll your eyes-

268
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,900
Kaylie: So true.
Dr Phill: Listen, You can roll your eyes-

269
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,740
Dr Phill: Listen, You can roll your eyes-

270
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,880
Pewds: I bet- she's probably high right now.

271
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,140
She goes, &quot;So true. I don't care&quot;.

272
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,120
Such a ?̷̡͚̰̰͔̤͂̄͑̀͐̏̾͆?̸̬̅̌́̅̾͝?̷̭̤̼̀̂̄̍̂̓͊̚͘͠?̸̗̜͉͐̓́̃̂ℍ̷̡̡͓̯̜͇̫̈́́̇̊̂̆̈́͠ℍ̸͚̫̤̊̽̕ℍ̴̫͚̜̜̐̿͊́͘ . I hate her.

273
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:13,840
NAAH

274
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:17,780
Dr. Phil: You can be sarcastic all you want, you are committing a crime!

275
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:18,980
Kaylie: Amen.

276
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:19,720
Pewds: *clap* Get 'em Phil! *clap* Keep drilling!

277
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,820
Pewds: *clap* Get 'em Phil! *clap* Keep drilling!
Dr: Phil: You are committing a crime!

278
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:21,560
Dr: Phil: You are committing a crime!

279
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,800
Mama Thot: Okay.

280
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:28,920
And you can tell- you can hear me, or you can tell it to a judge, but you are committing a crime.

281
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:33,040
This is the medical director of DCFS (Department of Child and Family Services). This is the man that makes

282
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,600
Pewds: Yeah! The director of DFS!
 
that decision. You are committing a crime!

283
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,420
Pewds: ??? ???? ???

284
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:42,980
Dr. Phil: This is not a matter of opinion! You are providing your child with alcohol, you are providing her with

285
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:47,320
marijuana, you are allowing her, knowingly, to have sex-

286
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,700
Pewds: And you're telling her about the things.

287
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,200
Dr. Phil: These are crimes!

288
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:57,020
* ? a ? p ? p ? l ? a ? u ? s ? e ? *

289
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:03,240
They look so dumbfounded. They just can't understand. 'Cause-- they're in this room where no one likes them,

290
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:08,960
right, everyone is against them and they just don't seem to understand why.

291
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:13,360
Dr. Phil: Do you not understand that by statute, it's a crime?

292
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,180
Kaylie: Okay.

293
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,840
Dr. Phil: No- not okay, do you not understand that?

294
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:23,160
Kaylie: I do understand that... Yeah, that you're...
but I explained why... why I do it that way.

295
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,920
If you- wanna have a crack at her, I--

296
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,360
Man: but you're breaking the law.

297
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,720
Kaylie: Okay.
Gabrielle: Oh no~

298
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,320
Kaylie: *mumbling*
Man: Yeah.

299
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:29,820
Dr. Phil: What did you just say?

300
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:30,800
Pewds: Oh. Yeah,
Dr. Phil: What did you just say?

301
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,820

00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:33,820
Kaylie: She's worse than I am.
Way worse than I am.

303
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:34,560
Dr. Phil: What'd you say?
Kaylie: She's worse than I am.
Way worse than I am.

304
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,720
Stubborn Brat: i SaiD oH nO

305
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,520
Dr. Phil: Oh, so you think this is a joke?

306
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,620
Brat: Yes.

307
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,780
Philler: Okay, you think this is a joke, 'cause this is not going to be funny in about five minutes.

308
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,820
Philler: Okay, you think this is a joke, 'cause this is not going to be funny in about five minutes.
 
Man: She's scared. x2

* ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? *

311
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:55,800
Dr. Phil: Do you have any idea...
what the research says about the

312
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,000
neurological impact of that on a teenage brain?

313
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,200
Gabrielle: No, and don't care.

314
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,440
(damn)

315
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,500
Kaylie: I told her that. x2

316
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,700
Dr. Phil: Well, that tells me the research is correct.

317
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,780
Pewds: OH!

318
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,380
SAVAGE, Dr. Phil!

319
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,180
Dr. Phil: Seriously!

320
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,600
*Pewds' corny laughter*

321
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,400
*clap x3*
Pewds: That's a clap. x2
 
Dr. Phil: What do you mean you don't care?

322
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,800
*clap x3*
Pewds: That's a clap. x2
 
Gabrielle: I don't.

323
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:21,340
Why, would a normal child-- with no disability (which is questionable)-- would need to smoke three times a day?

324
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:25,400
*clap x4*
Alright, my favorite bit. This is it, this is where she cries.

325
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,080
*snicker*

326
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:30,000
WHAT!? I like watching children cry.
Is there anything wrong with that?

327
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:36,080
Didn't think so. So Dr. Phil proposes-- these are both terrible parents, right? The only way to really save this

328
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:40,120
child, is to send her off to the Ranch.
To the Ranch with her!

329
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:47,120
Dr. Phil: I think you really only have one reasonable choice, to send her to a place called Turnabout Ranch.

330
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,160
Pewds: The Ranch! x2

332
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:55,300
That's right, you're going to the Ranch. You're going to the Ranch! You're going to the Ranch boi!

333
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,120
I feel like I'm the psycho, right?
This makes me so happy.

334
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:02,160
I might seem cruel here, but the
Turnabout Ranch seems awesome, okay?

335
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,140
I would love to go to the Turnabout Ranch, okay?

336
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:05,960
Girl: Real Ranch, real values. And I think why Turn About Ranch is so effective, it's kinda like a three-legged stool:

You're just gonna ride horses! What's the big deal? What's so bad about the Ranch, I don't get it!

348
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,280
Dr. Phil: Now...

Pewds: That's a clap! x2
Clap up for the ranch! Smash like for the Ranch.

she's gone.

353
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:47,680
Pewds: Can I go to the ranch? Dr. Phil, please.

354
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:53,400
Maybe I should fake being a psycho kid, end up on Dr. Phil, go to the Ranch, and then I can make a react video

355
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,220
out of that video.

00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,600
Man: Absolutely.
Yup. x2

371
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:47,660
and at the end of it- it's kind of like Hunger Games, with psycho kids, you know? You don't feel bad because

372
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:54,360
they're psycho, right? So they all fight-- for survival on the Ranch. I think with the right people in mind, the right

373
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,700
people shooting it I think it could be a hit.
