1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,200
Battlefield 5 flops completely

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,180
Fortnite gets a new very important update

3
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:06,040
keep watching  to find out what it is

4
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,740
NASA gets a furry

5
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:09,620
What?

6
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:13,980
And once again, youtubers are crying about how hard their life is

7
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:14,660
boo boo

8
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,500
I'm Poppy Harlow *pops*

9
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:27,580
and you're watching Pew NewsÂ®

10
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:30,160
Our first story comes from Battlefield 5

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,340
An analist predicts that EA's 'Battlefield 5' will be a &quot;serious disappointment&quot;.

12
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,740
Preorders lag 'Call of Duty' by more than 85%

13
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:41,920
DAAAAAMMMN

14
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,280
I know, you feel it too don't you

15
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,720
anyone but EA, America's 5th most hated company

16
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,560
Ah, couldn't this please happen to anyone else now?

17
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:58,960
now I'm just Poppy Harlow. I'm not supposed to give my own opinion or speculation on this show, but I think

18
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:06,560
Ok, I think I might have a clue of why the Battlefield 5 preorders are doing so poorly.

19
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,220
But I think it might have something to do with the Battlefield 5 trailer

20
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:14,520
Completely flopping, getting four hundred and sixty thousand dislikes

21
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,400
as opposed to three hundred thirty four thousand likes,

22
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,080
making it the worst reveal trailer in their history.

23
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:25,060
And it seemed to focus more on pushing some form of social justice agenda

24
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:28,840
as opposed to just focusing on making it the coolest trailer they could make.

25
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,740
You see this? That's a girl with a bionic arm.

26
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:37,100
That's right. They exist in World War 2, and if you don't think so, then you're just uneducated

27
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:40,580
Oh, you think I'm joking? No, that's what EA actually responded and said.

28
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:41,520
*laughs*

29
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,820
&quot;Accept it or don't buy the game&quot;

30
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:50,680
The chief design officer of Battlefield, Patrick Soderlund said:

31
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,340
&quot;We felt like in today's world - I have a 13 year old daughter that

32
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:58,869
when the trailer came out and she saw all the flak, she asked me, 'Dad,

33
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:04,080
why is this happening?' She plays Fortnite, and says, 'I can be a girl in Fortnite.

34
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:09,180
Why are people so upset about this?'&quot; And Soderlund responded with *punch*

35
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:12,480
WE PLAY THE SIMS IN THIS HOUSE OR BATTLEFIELD!

36
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,489
I'm just kidding. That's not what he said.

37
00:02:14,489 --> 00:02:19,080
What he said was &quot;as a parent, how the heck am I gonna respond to this?

38
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,300
And I just said 'You know what? You're right. This is not okay'&quot;.

39
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:26,049
Then they go on to say &quot;These people who are uneducated

40
00:02:26,049 --> 00:02:31,599
they don't understand that this is a plausible scenario.&quot; Hey guys uh

41
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,700
you remember that plausible scenario where the

42
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:39,830
girl with the bionic arm in World War 2 just made everyone look completely like fools

43
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:44,250
I had no idea what they were doing. Remember her remember that that's a plausible scenario

44
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,540
Everyone knows that are you uneducated or something like that?

45
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:52,610
Ya dingus. Then finally Patrick Soderlund said &quot;we don't take any flack

46
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:56,569
We stand up for the cause, because I think those people who don't understand it

47
00:02:56,569 --> 00:03:03,540
well, you have two choices: either accept it or don't buy the game. I'm fine with either or it's just not okay.

48
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,540
What is this?

49
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,360
Electronic Art chief design officer is leaving!

50
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,020
What?!

51
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:12,300
just two moths before the launch of the new installment of one of it's biggest franchises, battlefield

52
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,900
Patrick Soderlund has been with EA for nearly 20 years

53
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:22,049
Earlier this month Crowen  said pre- order sales of battlefield 5 have been weak. This is really strange

54
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:27,860
You know, I shouldn't be putting pieces together, but I think I understand what happened here this response to me

55
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:30,140
It sounds like someone that just doesn't care

56
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:36,120
it's someone that doesn't want to take criticism or at least not trying to understand what the criticism is and

57
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,460
instead you're drawing the line in the sand between your consumers and what your

58
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:46,500
ideology is. And this is the problem that you face when you push social politics into video games because

59
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,420
Like any politics is all about making your opponent seem like a villain

60
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:58,100
So you're basically making your consumers the villain here and he's saying well if you don't like what we're trying to do here you're uneducated

61
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:02,549
Don't buy the game and instead of trying to understand what the actual

62
00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:06,109
Criticism he's making the criticism seem like &quot;oh

63
00:04:06,109 --> 00:04:10,850
You're just uneducated or you're just a sexist or all you don't want to see women in video games, huh?

64
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:14,850
Is that the problem?&quot;, when really that's not the problem at all.

65
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:21,060
Patrick is not wrong for saying that today's gaming is gender diverse or he's not wrong for looking after the interests of his daughter

66
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:27,980
in video games. If the option was just for females to be a playable character in battlefield 5 no one would care, but this

67
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:32,960
Trailer showed so clearly that you care more about pushing this agenda

68
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:39,740
Than making a cool trailer. That's a problem. It's a statement this trailer. It's basically saying &quot;hey, huh?

69
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:44,070
What do you think about this? Huh? What's your opinion about this? Huh? Look what we did&quot;

70
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:49,320
That's why people don't like it and instead of trying to acknowledge that and trying to understand that

71
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:55,130
He says that everyone else is just uneducated. So it's no surprise really that he was let go after this

72
00:04:55,130 --> 00:05:00,000
I don't really want to celebrate people losing their job or whatever, especially working so long

73
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,620
But maybe this would have been for the better. I understand that. It's a good intention just really bad execution

74
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:11,180
Then the cluster if you haven't followed the marketing for battlefield 5

75
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:14,980
It gets worse from here if you can *laughs*

76
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:20,340
For some reason they decided to hire Trevor Noah to market battlefield 5

77
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:24,860
Trevor Noah, of course, which everyone knows as a battlefield veteran everybody

78
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:30,220
I don't know about you guys but whenever Trevor Noah opens his mouth I just cannot stop laughing.

79
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:35,100
He's just too funny.

80
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,180
Welcome everyone to the battlefield 5 live reveal

81
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:43,790
I'm your host for this evening Trevor Noah, and I'm so excited to be here introducing this new edition of battlefield

82
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:50,660
Which for some reason everyone has really assumed this battlefield 5 I mean and not battlefield V, could be V, why not V?

83
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:53,400
It stands for vagina! *claps and laughter*

84
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,820
See, I don't even need writers to do the work for me. I'm way better.

85
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:00,480
No offense to Trevor if people like him great.

86
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,960
but he's clearly so fake and it's so

87
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,100
painfully transparent during this

88
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:11,940
reveal that they did - the remarks he makes are so cringy

89
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:16,020
Trevor: co-op is back and that's one of my favorite aspects of Battlefield 1

90
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,440
Felix: Battlefield one?! Oh...

91
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,040
Trevor: favorite aspects of Battlefield 1

92
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,840
First and foremost, Trevor Noah.

93
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,820
Trevor: first and foremost

94
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:24,900
I'm a gamer.

95
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,420
&quot;favorite aspects of Battlefield one&quot;

96
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:32,240
I'm a gamer, first and foremost everybody. You would expect anyone to believe this? Yikes, ok.

97
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,900
Trevor: Wow, the car, the thing, the man, the boo

98
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:40,260
You saw the thing man. Uh-huh. I hope they got insurance. That was insane. Do you see that?

99
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:45,440
How many millions do they spend on this look at it. They built this whole set, right? They hired Trevor Noah

100
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,280
How much do you think this cost?

101
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:53,620
I feel bad cuz clearly there's so many bad decisions being made by a minority of people

102
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:56,140
I'm sure there's plenty

103
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:58,720
of really talented people working on this game.

104
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,500
Dice is a very good studio

105
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,900
I think they made some amazing games that I'm really a big fan of,

106
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:08,540
But it seems like you got the wrong people making the wrong decisions

107
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:14,120
and I I don't know I feel bad for all the other people working on it cuz there's probably a massive team on it

108
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:20,960
It's gone so far that even the fans of battlefield 5 themself are memeing the whole thing.

109
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:26,400
(Gru's plan meme) mess up the reveal, tell people not to buy the game if they don't like it, people don't buy the game

110
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,820
What?! People don't buy the game! Big shocker everyone

111
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:34,180
(infinity meme) Fans: Did you completely f up the marketing for this game? EA: Yes

112
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,520
Fans: What did it cost?

113
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,120
EA: EVERYTHING

114
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:36,820
(poppy pops again)

115
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:37,860
that's it for the - that

116
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,580
next news (meme review clap)

117
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,620
Here's a sentence I never thought I would say:

118
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:44,880
A furry got accepted into NASA. That's right.

119
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:49,760
2018 everybody. What a time to be alive. On Twitter, Naomi H tweeted:

120
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:54,460
everyone shut the f up I got accepted for a NASA internship

121
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:59,020
Then, Homer Hickam, or Haickam, I don't know, tweeted back saying &quot;language.&quot;

122
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,540
then Naomi (laughs)

123
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,600
(faceplam and tries to not laught )

124
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,000
tweeted back

125
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,940
Suck my dick and balls I'm working at NASA

126
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:13,320
Homer responded with &quot;I am on the National Space Council that oversees NASA&quot;

127
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:20,140
*sings* What's this? *laughs*

128
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:25,240
&quot;NASA intern loses job after vulgar tweet&quot; Oh my god

129
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,300
This is just too funny. It's too good. How did this happen?

130
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,400
How do you not look up who you're tweeting at if you

131
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:36,060
tell someone to suck your dick and balls? They got the most irresponsible

132
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:40,180
person I know, even I would do that a

133
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:47,380
A simple Google search and you would know that Homer Hickam is a former NASA engineer who trained the first Japanese astronaut

134
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:48,120
Jesus Christ

135
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,900
So basically, Homer wasn't the one responsible for Naomi losing

136
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:57,070
Her internship, he made a response to this saying he wasn't offended by the word

137
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:01,660
He was actually looking after Naomi to make sure that this wouldn't get her in trouble

138
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:08,540
And the fact was that actually all the people that kept hating on Homer for tweeting this

139
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:11,440
Actually are the ones that brought it to NASA's attention

140
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,920
because they used a ashtag NASA ashtag or whatever, and the ones that actually were

141
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,200
responsible for the recruit - the recruitment

142
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:25,249
of this individual, saw it and then decided. Well, we can't let this person come on board, which is pretty understandable

143
00:09:25,249 --> 00:09:33,290
I'm not for anyone losing their job or internship or whatever. I hope that this person do actually get another chance

144
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:35,300
But it's really funny

145
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:42,729
Nevertheless just from the sense of &quot;haha screw you guys self justice instant self justice&quot;

146
00:09:42,729 --> 00:09:45,900

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,060
We did it. Our memes made an influence. I'm so proud

153
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:08,740
we chilled this In a meme review in June talking about the bus driver meme

154
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:14,019
Immediately you guys started memeing it on the PewDiePie's subreddit the same day

155
00:10:14,019 --> 00:10:16,180
It came out people started tweeting

156
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:19,200
There should be an option where you can thank the bus driver

157
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,680
and they listen so now

158
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,509
Thanks to thanks to the power of memes

159

We made a positive impact in the world and you can now thank the bus driver in Fortnite

160
00:10:29,469 --> 00:10:35,060

163
00:10:43,189 --> 00:10:46,420
Youtubers are feeling the burn

164
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,200
OOOH

165
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,700
What are they complaining about now? Huh? I don't want to hear this Swedish millionaire complain again

166
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,940
Alright, the reason I'm bringing this up is because uuh

167
00:10:54,940 --> 00:11:00,920
It got a lot of mainstream media attention that youtubers feeling fatigued or worked out

168
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:06,399
It was covered by The Guardian and the Telegraph and Polygon, I actually didn't hate their article, how about that?

169
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,650
They also mentioned my video in it. I made a video again

170
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:12,600
I think a month ago or something like that

171
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:18,170
where I talked about - I try to give some insight on what it's like to be a use of creator and I did this mainly

172
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:25,350
Because I think a lot of people think that just because you get money and fame all your other problems will go away

173
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:29,220
And I try to get some insight to explain

174
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:34,940
Why that isn't necessarily the case. I know it's really tired and overhearing me talking about this

175
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:41,220
But I think this video probably played a big impact on this getting more attention, which I'm really glad about. I

176
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:47,550
Luckily don't feel burn out. I feel better than I ever done on youtube. And this is all really thanks to

177
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:48,960
Me making better decisions

178
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,940
I think and also you guys.

179
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:57,960
It's so easy to get caught up with the numbers and this is what these articles are talking about because if you take a break

180
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:03,630
It'll be a problem. And I feel bad seeing a lot of my friends suffer from this as well feeling burned out

181
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:06,000
Feeling really worn down

182
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:12,660
because of it and that's why I made that video to hopefully give people insight because I think the more people

183
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:17,220
UNDERSTAND each other the world will be a better place. That's right. That's all I care about.

184
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:21,840
I just want people to be happy trust me. That's my number one priority.

185
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:25,100
Smash a like on this video so i will get more views that will help me out a lot

186
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:28,740
