1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:10,500
32 seconds of waterlogged water no

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,410
ghosts oh thank God for a minute there I

3
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:14,430
thought that was gonna be a movie about

4
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:15,840
deep blue something we'd have to sit

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:16,980
through a hundred minutes of Breakfast

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,060
at Tiffany's I don't think I could

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,960
relive 1995 all over again a minute into

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,460
the proceedings and movie is imitation

9
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,200
drowsing so hard that I can't tell if

10
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,850
it's an homage a parody or a blatant

11
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,500
ripoff since all three of those have

12
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,030
been done to death here's a sin for each

13
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:34,109
of the possibilities yeah woman said she

14
00:00:34,109 --> 00:00:35,879
hears seas feel something and her horny

15
00:00:35,879 --> 00:00:37,020
boyfriend thinks it has something to do

16
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,370
with sex but it's not because it's a

17
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:41,130
scary monster cliche is every character

18
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:42,570
in this going to nonchalantly narrate

19
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:43,950
all their actions I'm getting my leg bit

20
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,720
off man a shark just booting my hand bro

21
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,040
actually I might have joined that better

22
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,450
if this movie goes full dude where's my

23
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:49,890
arm I guarantee you it's an improvement

24
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,870
it is said the charts can detect line in

25
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,430
the water up to a mile away that's what

26
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:54,870
makes them such dangerous alcoholic

27
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,930
predators our pool next shark anut also

28
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:59,460
later we find out that the lab has no

29
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,469
real clue how the shark got out so how

30
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:02,610
did they even know the shark was gone

31
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:04,799
and where when enough time to save these

32
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,630
horny teens I don't care how harpoon

33
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,250
that shark is there was no way these two

34
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,390
would just be sitting in the water and

35
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:10,890
not continuing to panic swim their way

36
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:12,570
back onto the boat in a slow news day

37
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,520
national newspapers ran with the shark

38
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,770
almost eats teenager story also it's

39
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:17,820
good to see that there's at least one

40
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,530
firm out there helping victims deal with

41
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,689
anyone's the clam doctor the 200 million

42
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:23,430
had sunk in this company is doing great

43
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,020
part to your research I'll add this

44
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,549
wealthy suit could remind Susan of the

45
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:28,140
exact amount of money he's sunk into the

46
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,840
company for maximum clunkiness 200,000

47
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,310
men and women develop out Simas each

48
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,720
year you gotta love a movie that is all

49
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,070
about sharks eating people trying to

50
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,240
make its story matter by throwing

51
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,890
Alzheimer's into it give me till Monday

52
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,680
morning arbitrary timeframe is arbitrary

53
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,240
but what I'm really wondering about is

54
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,240
why is Ronny Cox aka ko Hagan from Total

55
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,890
Recall even here he didn't get one line

56
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:48,479
it's clear Sam Jackson is the real boss

57
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,799
here but I guess this company is still

58
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,240
old fashioned and needs the appearance

59
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,009
of an old white guy running things could

60
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:57,720
give you a big kiss you could remove

61
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,280
that no there is no way you've

62
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,689
transported her here without sedating

63
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:02,130
her so why wouldn't you take that out on

64
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:03,479
the journey so how much do you know

65
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:05,100
about our facility treat me like a

66
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,720
tourist that way you'll have an excuse

67
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,069
to exposition the spannabis

68
00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:09,360
and then we talked about the license

69
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,829
plate a minute ago but is the whole

70
00:02:10,829 --> 00:02:12,329
reason why this guy jumped into a shark

71
00:02:12,329 --> 00:02:13,709
tank so that he could get this license

72
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:15,870
plate out of its mouth done is issue but

73
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:16,730
in a pet shop

74
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:18,440
Baton Rouge ate everything in his fish

75
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,940
tank then he ate the guy that bought him

76
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,440
I can't decide which are more boring and

77
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,909
pointless the stories these characters

78
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:23,989
tell or the characters themselves

79
00:02:23,989 --> 00:02:26,030
actually they don't like the taste of us

80
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:26,720
very much

81
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,980
they bite yeah it's because they think

82
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,140
you're fat little seal well it doesn't

83
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,580
give me much confidence I mean whether

84
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:32,870
or not they don't like the taste of you

85
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,400
is immaterial they can confuse you with

86
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,980
a seal you got full sentences usually he

87
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:39,440
just kind of nods and I choose a third

88
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,879
option where he's not in the movie it's

89
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,080
pretty scary stuff huh

90
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,610
yes it is yes I am scared my heart is

91
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:48,769
beating very fast shall we discuss again

92
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:52,190
how scary it is they're going home we

93
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,840
run a skeleton crew on the weekend after

94
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,519
a long week at work and seeing the same

95
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,079
faces every day I'm not buying the party

96
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:58,459
atmosphere on this boat grumbles and

97
00:02:58,459 --> 00:02:59,900
mumbles seem much more likely than music

98
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,120
and dancing these fences off the water

99
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,519
eight feet give or take a centimeter I'm

100
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:05,900
all for progressive unions but you've

101
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,099
officially gone too far when you're

102
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:08,629
mixing standard English measurements

103
00:03:08,629 --> 00:03:10,220
with the metric system that's just not

104
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,930
the way God intended it sighs the half a

105
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:14,120
mile of catwalks you bought us titanium

106
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,829
based fencing around all the lagoon and

107
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:17,450
pins let me tell you more about the

108
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:18,560
things that you already know but the

109
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,819
audience doesn't there's nothing that

110
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:21,919
says your movie is from 1999 more than

111
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:23,480
when you see stuff like this you know

112
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,190
like saffron burrows when the word

113
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,750
started flashing on the screen I thought

114
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,130
it was your typical movie computer data

115
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:29,630
but it turns out these are the words to

116
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,010
an article about the brain I know this

117
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,049
is some 1999 web page nonsense I don't

118
00:03:33,049 --> 00:03:34,639
remember or the filmmakers made these

119
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:36,230
words fly onto the screen to look cool

120
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:37,549
why would you open this and get sent to

121
00:03:37,549 --> 00:03:40,130
the middle of the article in man yeah

122
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:41,599
I'm the man Warner Brothers somehow

123
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,919
advertised his future samuel l.jackson

124
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:47,209
movies six years in advance as LL Cool J

125
00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:48,799
hitting on this bird I guess he really

126
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,090
does need love are we supposed to

127
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:51,620
believe that shark cannibalism is the

128
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,239
only way to feed these monsters even if

129
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:54,440
it was I doubt a group of marine

130
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,060
biologists with a deep love of animals

131
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:56,790
would let it happen

132
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:58,269
[Music]

133
00:03:58,269 --> 00:04:00,440
we'll be waste time with a surprise

134
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,000
birthday party when they should be deep

135
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,680
blue seeing already we haven't seen one

136
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,329
human death yet and my bloodlust is

137
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:06,620
killing me I sure hope they find my

138
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,209
Pierre to Alzheimer's though how's life

139
00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:10,400
underwater well it's a lot less

140
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,440
complicated than it is on the surface

141
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,840
that's for sure I swear the dialogue in

142
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,099
this movie is like passing a kidney

143
00:04:16,099 --> 00:04:18,109
stone it takes forever for anyone to say

144
00:04:18,109 --> 00:04:19,250
anything and when they finally do

145
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,510
there's so little substance to it that

146
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,590
you can't believe how much pain it

147
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:23,210
causes one day I'd have to tell me how

148
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:25,130
you learned that one day you'll take me

149
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:26,900
up on that beer and maybe I will you

150
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,190
can't have a shark or dinosaur movie

151
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,539
without the movies Wrangler hitting on

152
00:04:29,539 --> 00:04:30,680
the hot chick in charge

153
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,940
they don't have a history or this would

154
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,800
be a skipped basis fences like I asked

155
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,680
it's okay can you not see for yourself

156
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,419
that the fences have been raised or did

157
00:04:38,419 --> 00:04:40,160
Tom raise them so minimally that Carter

158
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,639
can tell they recognize that gun sigh

159
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:46,009
did you not just say a minute ago by

160
00:04:46,009 --> 00:04:47,960
using a hormonal enhancer we increase

161
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,600
this females forebrain to five times its

162
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,530
normal size

163
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:52,850
isn't it possible that your brain

164
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:54,380
testing is causing the Sharks to learn

165
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,699
new skills might a movie scientists

166
00:04:55,699 --> 00:04:57,050
always say that's impossible when they

167
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:58,580
see right in front of their face it's

168
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,930
hilarious that the Sharks have figured

169
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,460
out the concept of surveillance cameras

170
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,750
just because they have bigger brains now

171
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,370
and it's even funnier that they disabled

172
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,720
the first two cameras without being seen

173
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,190
but on the last one one of these sharks

174
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,930
appears fully on screen to confirm that

175
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:10,009
they were the ones behind it all

176
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:11,419
just minutes ago these sharks were smart

177
00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:12,889
enough to hunt together recognize a gun

178
00:05:12,889 --> 00:05:14,509
and take out cameras but now this one

179
00:05:14,509 --> 00:05:16,009
attacks an empty scuba tank all alone

180
00:05:16,009 --> 00:05:17,570
apparently the Sharks intelligence is on

181
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:22,759
a plot based timing system how exactly

182
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:24,440
did Carter get this giant sedated shark

183
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,030
from where he was to here guessing they

184
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,380
aren't exactly easy to move underwater

185
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,300
also what was the original plan to get

186
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,770
her on this loading platform that didn't

187
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:32,150
involve Carter free swimming through

188
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,680
shark territory he had to have some sort

189
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,330
of plan right if I know my marine

190
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:36,740
biology man I'm sure I don't

191
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,630
shark skin is not smooth like a dolphins

192
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,580
but scaly and sharp so swimmy Carter

193
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,930
here should be cutting up his hand

194
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,460
trying to pet it she's sleeping like a

195
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,960
baby these assholes continue to

196
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,490
underestimate how smart these sharks are

197
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:47,960
despite all the evidence and their

198
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,490
scientists which makes it worse I'm

199
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:52,180
adding five sins for the stupidity

200
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,289
remember was it the Meissner or the

201
00:05:54,289 --> 00:05:55,820
Stanislavski acting technique that

202
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,289
included reacting to everything with an

203
00:05:57,289 --> 00:05:58,669
over-the-top double date whichever it is

204
00:05:58,669 --> 00:06:00,080
these actors are obviously thoroughly

205
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,460
trained in it there are so many hard

206
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,990
stairs in this movie I swear Paddington

207
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:04,490
is lurking somewhere nearby to teach me

208
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:06,590
a heartfelt lesson introducing two cc's

209
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:09,650
of the protein complex into cultured

210
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:12,259
inactive brain neurons of an outsider's

211
00:06:12,259 --> 00:06:12,860
patient

212
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:15,050
god bless movie science just suck some

213
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,699
cerebrum Druce from the shark and plop

214
00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:18,169
it on a chunk of Alzheimer's brain to do

215
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:19,639
a test who needs all those silly

216
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:21,689
in-between steps right

217
00:06:21,689 --> 00:06:25,229
oh that's gonna leave a nasty skarsgård

218
00:06:25,229 --> 00:06:27,539
scar scar also goes to show that curing

219
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:29,369
Alzheimer's cost an arm enough we know

220
00:06:29,369 --> 00:06:32,909
at least an arm why is the only option a

221
00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:34,799
gun that's kept behind glass shouldn't

222
00:06:34,799 --> 00:06:36,299
Carter have another tranq ready to go is

223
00:06:36,299 --> 00:06:37,289
this really the standard emergency

224
00:06:37,289 --> 00:06:39,749
procedure Jesus does preacher even get

225
00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:41,189
to go to his quarters this guy is in the

226
00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:42,989
kitchen 24/7 what's he even doing here

227
00:06:42,989 --> 00:06:44,299
right now

228
00:06:44,299 --> 00:06:46,439
these sharks learned the concept of

229
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,029
murder while swimming around in a tank

230
00:06:48,029 --> 00:06:50,189
getting bigger brains also let's break

231
00:06:50,189 --> 00:06:51,629
down this nonsense piece by piece

232
00:06:51,629 --> 00:06:53,610
shall we first how is Professor Selvig

233
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:54,899
still alive that breathing apparatus

234
00:06:54,899 --> 00:06:56,819
isn't meant for water use he's lost a

235
00:06:56,819 --> 00:06:58,229
lot of blood and it's been underwater at

236
00:06:58,229 --> 00:06:59,639
least three minutes at the very least

237
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:01,889
this man should be passed out second I

238
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:03,389
don't care how fast that shark is moving

239
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:05,039
you can't throw a sidelong projectile

240
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,389
with that much surface area through

241
00:07:06,389 --> 00:07:07,949
water at all as soon as discount Bruce

242
00:07:07,949 --> 00:07:09,509
attempts to mouths javelin his toy

243
00:07:09,509 --> 00:07:10,860
through the window it would immediately

244
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,019
stop and sink third even if that scars

245
00:07:13,019 --> 00:07:14,759
dirt somehow made it to the window with

246
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:16,469
full force it's not going to crack glass

247
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:18,239
built to withstand the pressure of that

248
00:07:18,239 --> 00:07:20,129
depth of water and fourth what's the

249
00:07:20,129 --> 00:07:22,829
actual movie this is a lesson about the

250
00:07:22,829 --> 00:07:27,629
drinking a local day comic relief feels

251
00:07:27,629 --> 00:07:28,769
like that's the only reason he's here

252
00:07:28,769 --> 00:07:30,239
and why he's separated from the others

253
00:07:30,239 --> 00:07:32,009
so the movie can cut to him talking to

254
00:07:32,009 --> 00:07:33,569
God or his parrot it's as if the movies

255
00:07:33,569 --> 00:07:35,129
plot itself and Michael Rapaport wasn't

256
00:07:35,129 --> 00:07:37,110
enough what the hell is that

257
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:38,550
so this noise is supposed to be a shark

258
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,019
trying to open this door is that what we

259
00:07:40,019 --> 00:07:41,399
were being led to believe here how did

260
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:42,659
the shark even know they would be here

261
00:07:42,659 --> 00:07:44,099
and at this very moment did the shark

262
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:45,389
set up some sort of closed-circuit

263
00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:46,919
viewing system to watch their prey you

264
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:48,209
know what in this movie why not

265
00:07:48,209 --> 00:07:50,759
yeah that's pretty damn obvious we don't

266
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:52,289
know what they're doing yet oh come on

267
00:07:52,289 --> 00:07:54,029
you've seen more than enough evidence to

268
00:07:54,029 --> 00:07:55,229
know that they're actively trying to

269
00:07:55,229 --> 00:07:56,939
kill you and probably escaped to things

270
00:07:56,939 --> 00:07:58,199
they've already successfully done in

271
00:07:58,199 --> 00:07:59,759
this picture now maybe you don't know

272
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,019
what they plan to do is build nuclear

273
00:08:01,019 --> 00:08:02,610
weapons and invade Mars but the

274
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:04,319
short-term goal here is to kill you and

275
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,360
escape Jim and I use gene therapies to

276
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,159
increase that brain mass as a side

277
00:08:08,159 --> 00:08:10,229
effect the shots gotten smarter how

278
00:08:10,229 --> 00:08:11,909
smart were the Sharks before today one

279
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:13,169
escaped earlier to attack the teen's

280
00:08:13,169 --> 00:08:14,939
while the others sat back and kicked it

281
00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:15,689
in the shark tank

282
00:08:15,689 --> 00:08:17,189
drinking margaritas but as soon as

283
00:08:17,189 --> 00:08:18,959
Russell shows up and susan has 48 hours

284
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:20,729
to prove to him their work is going

285
00:08:20,729 --> 00:08:22,289
somewhere they suddenly know they never

286
00:08:22,289 --> 00:08:24,659
knew before what you've done is not this

287
00:08:24,659 --> 00:08:26,219
all the way to the bottom of the goddamn

288
00:08:26,219 --> 00:08:28,529
food chain below rabbits who would have

289
00:08:28,529 --> 00:08:30,089
thought that 20 years later a floating

290
00:08:30,089 --> 00:08:31,679
playboy would make me think of politics

291
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:33,089
and Pietschmann and hush money instead

292
00:08:33,089 --> 00:08:35,459
of other stuff

293
00:08:35,459 --> 00:08:37,990
LL Cool J easily outruns a super shark

294
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,579
in water I'm not even sure LL Cool J

295
00:08:39,579 --> 00:08:41,620
could outrun a shark on Land Shark BL B

296
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,360
does not include Terminator style data

297
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,040
flashing on the screen so what the shots

298
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,629
get through the fence and into the ocean

299
00:08:46,629 --> 00:08:49,360
it's okay the fence on the ocean side is

300
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,550
titanium wait did they forget about the

301
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:52,870
beginning of this movie where one of

302
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,339
their shirts got into the ocean and they

303
00:08:54,339 --> 00:08:58,029
never figured out how this asshole

304
00:08:58,029 --> 00:08:59,500
without fail has said something like

305
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,660
phat buck to LL Cool J the entire movie

306
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,220
but now that he's climbing some shelves

307
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,720
he decided to be quiet until it was time

308
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:11,350
to be a jump scaring dick there was this

309
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,730
much gas in the room to create an

310
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:14,079
explosion well I didn't everything blow

311
00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:15,610
as soon as he lit the zipper it's at

312
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:17,019
this point that LL Cool J might have

313
00:09:17,019 --> 00:09:18,430
considered a slight name change

314
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:20,829
although LL he J and now L burn J don't

315
00:09:20,829 --> 00:09:22,660
quite have the ring do they get that

316
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:34,060
close suggestion shadowing holy what a

317
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,800
great death scene the whole movie makes

318
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,149
Russell out to be the potential hero of

319
00:09:37,149 --> 00:09:38,649
this movie because he saved some people

320
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:40,569
from an avalanche then he's eaten and it

321
00:09:40,569 --> 00:09:42,459
is even Telegraph me this is probably

322
00:09:42,459 --> 00:09:47,209
all you remember about this movie

323
00:09:47,209 --> 00:09:51,559
I wasn't even aware that vacuums

324
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:53,149
operated on a three-second delay for

325
00:09:53,149 --> 00:09:56,269
dramatic timing good to know the idea

326
00:09:56,269 --> 00:09:57,800
that these two could close this door

327
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,329
with this amount of water rushing in is

328
00:09:59,329 --> 00:10:01,129
as likely as a sarcastic youtube channel

329
00:10:01,129 --> 00:10:02,569

[Music]

332
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,150
once again I'm unsure of what kind of

333
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,590
GPS these sharks are using that they

334
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:09,940
know exactly where the humans are and

335
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:10,840
what they're doing I haven't seen

336
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,280
supernatural chasing this ridiculous

337
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,960
since the tornados went Helen hunting on

338
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:21,100
twister hero stuff blah blah blah scary

339

sharks blah blah blah saved the day blah

340
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:26,020
blah pad the run time big real big

341
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:29,680
what's that if you're gonna tell someone

342
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,030
they have brass balls who goes through

343
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,800
the trouble of saying you're big real

344
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,070
big

345
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:34,570
so that the guy has to play a guessing

346
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:36,280
game as to what that means she's been

347
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,780
bobbing in this water for a few seconds

348
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,160
now and somehow the super intelligent

349
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,300
shark that has been stalking them

350
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,130
non-stop hasn't eaten his Jan sandwich

351
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:43,480
yet it's not like there's anywhere for

352
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,740
the shark to go is it taking a nap

353
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:47,980
because of severe shark alep see is

354
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,360
there a reason why Janice can't swim

355
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,530
over to the part of the ladder that

356
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:52,270
isn't broken climb up it and get to

357
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,350
where they aren't there is the movie

358
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,850
saying the current is too strong for her

359
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:57,700
to make that move no worries Jan the

360
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,200
water was rising so quickly before that

361
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,460
it should get you up to that ladder in

362
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,020
no time what's that oh sorry

363
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,460
Jan apparently the laws of physics have

364
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,170
an on and off switch that corresponds

365
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:06,700
with the need for dramatic tension tough

366
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,620
luck close-up shocked face close-up sad

367
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,690
face close-up dumb face seriously the

368
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:11,680
movie is so obsessed with these

369
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,720
continuous faces of death reaction shots

370
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,980
it might as well have been sponsored by

371
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:17,350
Apple FaceTime fancy meeting I mean

372
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:19,450
convenient meeting you here Jan is a

373
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:21,130
healthy girl something means it has run

374
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:22,660
on batteries when most of your friends

375
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:23,920
have been shark food and you're afraid

376
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,570
for your life I always find that a bit

377
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:27,190
of my dead friend's vibrator humor is

378
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:28,750
exactly the thing to bring hope back to

379
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:31,420
the situation sharks I think it's been

380
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,980
established that these sharks smell wine

381
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:35,020
in the water so you should be good

382
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:39,070
one night a whole week to grab hold of a

383
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:41,050
half and a second could seem like an ass

384
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:43,810
on a hot woman never can seem like a

385
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:46,270
second indeed early Einstein equations

386
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,950
included pictures of large breasts on a

387
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,870
chalkboard it would later just be DM in

388
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:52,240
e equals MC squared also e equals MC

389
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,070
Hammer squared I spent four years at

390
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:56,200
Caltech and that's the best physics

391
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,850
explanation I've ever heard not exactly

392
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,350
a ringing endorsement for Caltech then

393
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:01,200
is it we got one who's

394
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,790
sharks left thanks for the sharks

395
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,350
position and all but it's not as if this

396
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:06,090
movie has done any work helping us

397
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:07,530
understand what each of the three sharks

398
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:08,640
were doing at any given moment

399
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,930
honestly except for the fact that one

400
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,370
appeared to fry in the oven they might

401
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:12,960
as well all be the same shark about that

402
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,480
date or everyone dying isn't just tragic

403
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,330
yes fish death is always useless doctor

404
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:19,800
everything in this movie they've given

405
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,480
out all cool j2se sounds like the type

406
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,250
of thing you've nod your head and smoke

407
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,600
some more weed and agreement too but

408
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,800
then the next day you'd be like damn

409
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,990
none of that is true at all and everyone

410
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:29,370
the Taco Bell will be wondering what the

411
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:31,850
you're yelling about stellan skarsgård

412
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:35,040
michael rip apart okay I'm done also six

413
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,330
years after Jurassic Park and this is

414
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:37,650
the best we can do this is the fakest

415
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:39,000
michael rapaport his looks and see was

416
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,760
Joey the raccoon and dr. Dolittle - wow

417
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,860
look at that preach just conveniently

418
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,750
convenient at the same convenient place

419
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,340
as he convenience before ladies and

420
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,690
gentlemen it's the rare convenient

421
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:53,610
appearance double down let's never make

422
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:55,080
it out of situations like this

423
00:12:55,080 --> 00:13:00,360
situations are racist on a classic

424
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,130
dorsal fin fake out every shark movie

425
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:03,870
has one and none of them since jaws feel

426
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:07,980
original in the slightest this is sort

427
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,570
of the worst aspect of this movie there

428
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:10,950
are two sharks but they seem to be

429
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:12,720
covering impossible ground throughout

430
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,430
the entire sea lap and what happened to

431
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:15,450
those sharks working together

432
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:16,740
wasn't it a big deal when they notice

433
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,970
the Sharks were in sync with each other

434
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:19,530
they've split up since they entered the

435
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:20,970
lab and none of that has mattered at all

436
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:22,830
movies were attractive people's clothing

437
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:24,510
is always needed for something more

438
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:26,160
important than wearing guys after this

439
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,420
movie it's gonna be awfully hard to get

440
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,740
wood if I can't see a shark getting

441
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,270
electrocuted in fact I've checked the

442
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:32,130
Box on my eHarmony account that says

443
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:34,050
must own multiple disposable sharks for

444
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:35,670
sexual purposes sharks are ejected

445
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,920
turning water bright colors these

446
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,630
extinguishers should be a distraction

447
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,670
sure but you turn these guys all super

448
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:43,650
kill a Frank and shark expert ala genius

449
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:44,970
remember why would any other normal

450
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:46,740
shark rules even apply to them that's to

451
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,660
bring up too fast your lungs will pop

452
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,430
like a balloon you want the sunny kid in

453
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:51,690
your class where you what kind of

454
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:53,250
situation do you think this is dude were

455
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,780
you expecting the Tom Jane Comedy Hour

456
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,130
here weren't you the guy who was all

457
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:57,420
business a minute ago when you said you

458
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,680
wanted to get the fuck out of here

459
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,060
maybe I'm harping too much of this comic

460
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,650
relief character but damn there's a time

461
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:03,240
to switch it off and this is it dive

462
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,200
ride advice

463
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,720
so clearly your mouth didn't say surely

464
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,610
there oh sure you were about to say it

465
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:11,050
but the sound guy jumped the gun in the

466
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,970
editing and I'm the meatus mother made

467
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:15,070
the valley one thing I know about God is

468
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:16,209
that he loves when people say

469
00:14:16,209 --> 00:14:17,470
motherfucker in the middle of a prayer

470
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:19,060
it shows that you're engaged that you

471
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,680
mean it these sharks have torn arms off

472
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,149
and ripped people in half of one chomp

473
00:14:22,149 --> 00:14:23,800
but now they decided to just drag LL

474
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,480
Cool J around for a while why the sudden

475
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,899
need to play with their food okay but

476
00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:30,820
didn't he lose like a human-sized pool

477
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,350
of blood during that attack he pled out

478
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:33,459
for like a full minute they've been

479
00:14:33,459 --> 00:14:35,290
hurting us pushing us where they want

480
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:37,510
using us to flood the facility oh they

481
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,100
did not the only reason the lamb flooded

482
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,630
was because the helicopters towing cable

483
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,190
broke off and threw Jim into the water

484
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:43,810
then the Sharks used his body to break

485
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:45,220
the glass it's not for that one thing

486
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,600
that was completely unrelated to the

487
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,010
Sharks they would have never flooded the

488
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:49,899
facility also intelligence does not

489
00:14:49,899 --> 00:14:51,399
equal knowledge even if you made the

490
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:52,750
shark super intelligent they wouldn't

491
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,310
have the architectural scientific or

492
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,810
psychological knowledge to understand

493
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:57,220
even a portion of the things they needed

494
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,440
to know to execute that plan the freedom

495
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,630
that's deep blue sea roll credits from

496
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:02,920
up here you ought to be able to see me

497
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,079
spirit when I do you take this end of

498
00:15:05,079 --> 00:15:06,490
this cable hook it up to the positive

499
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:08,740
side of the boat battery and boom sounds

500
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:09,550
like you've been thinking about this

501
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:11,350
long before you ever had to do it you're

502
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:14,019
a sick Carter ocean just like seven

503
00:15:14,019 --> 00:15:15,820
years bad tetanus also Hollywood's been

504
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:16,990
doing fake blood for almost a century

505
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:18,640
now you think they could do better than

506
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:23,350
this cherry pie felling nonsense that's

507
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:24,490
the second time a ladder is broken

508
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:25,720
during this movie Russell Franklin

509
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,790
invested a ton in this facility but one

510
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,050
place where he cheaped out was ladder

511
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:32,860
safety that shark just roar underwater

512
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,720
wait a minute did preacher know the plan

513
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,250
about the harpoon and the battery wasn't

514
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,690
you out of your shot and sleeping during

515
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:39,100
that conversation or is he a kook who

516
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,510
also knows a lot about blowing up sharks

517
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:42,040
with harpoon battery compost some

518
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,779
incredibly lucky bull allows Carter to

519
00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:45,550
free himself with a harpoon and keep it

520
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:47,930
lodged in the shark somehow

521
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:50,810
I don't know if Carter could to find

522
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:52,730
this but I'm sitting it anyway also I

523
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:54,200
don't even have the energy anymore to

524
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,029
dissect the science of wet water battery

525
00:15:56,029 --> 00:15:57,860
conductive flare gunpowder or giant

526
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,899
shark explosions shark goes boom can I

527
00:15:59,899 --> 00:16:05,779
go home now deepest bluest my hat is

528

each other I just know that seven of us

532
00:16:37,089 --> 00:16:41,410
