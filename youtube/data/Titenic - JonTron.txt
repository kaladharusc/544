yeah no yeah no I see what you're

5
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:38,720
talking about she's right there on the

6
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,790
water I don't know man I don't think we

7
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,590
can make a game out of this nah man

8
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:43,970
plenty of games that boats that ain't

9
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:45,530
sink yet I mean look at call of duty

10
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:50,739
boats mediocre sails a sunk boats DLC oh

11
00:00:50,739 --> 00:00:53,120
okay so I suppose what you're telling me

12
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,040
is that we should not make a game about

13
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:01,250
the Titanic sinking yeah believe it or

14
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,470
not someone out there actually decided

15
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:05,119
it would be a good idea to make a game

16
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,060
based off of the Titanic you know the

17
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:11,380
great Titanic disaster of 1912 where

18
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,970
1,500 people met their fate with Davy

19
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:15,850
Jones in one of the deadliest maritime

20
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:18,619
disasters in history that's like making

21
00:01:18,619 --> 00:01:21,170
a game about the pump a volcano incident

22
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:24,140
tap a quickly cannot die as fast for

23
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:26,210
some of the games like this one Titanic

24
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:28,400
adventure out of time I can kind of see

25
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,930
where they were coming from at least the

26
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:32,180
Titanic was sort of a mysterious event

27
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:34,070
so they tapped into that and created a

28
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:35,750
point-and-click adventure mystery game

29
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,880
about it it's pretty atmospheric but it

30
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,420
has that old quirky 90s PC game vibe you

31
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:47,630
know the one this one you came after all

32
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,940

Belushi is that you did you travel back

37
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:03,560
in time to hide from the fact that you

38
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,990
were in hoodwinked it is good to see you

39
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:08,509
up and about you've been in your cabin

40
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:10,759
the whole voyage I bought the ticket

41
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:12,799
I'll do what I want but that's not why

42
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,180
we're here today now that they may be

43
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:14,690
silly

44
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:16,959
what I have to show you right now defies

45
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:22,450
explanation an NES game based on Titanic

46
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:24,980
the movie

47
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:29,910
the movie moving with any major

48
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,770
commercial success there's an inevitable

49
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,870
influx of off-brand or unlicensed

50
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,790
merchandise to capitalize on the hype

51
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:39,030
and apparently James Cameron's 1997 film

52
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,730
Titanic was no exception the movie

53
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:44,220
grossed over 2 billion dollars worldwide

54
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,320
and the only movie to pass it up since

55
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,720
is James Cameron's very own avatar with

56
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,020
2.7 billion again it was popular but a

57
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:55,050
video game about Titanic the movie and

58
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:58,410
an NES game we have a Chinese company to

59
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,030
thank for blessing us with this game

60
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,490
specifically Shen Zhen nan Jiang through

61
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:05,390
profits of our time Titanic came out in

62
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:08,580
1997 at the n64 in the ps1 wardi outter

63

who is lending marketed really but mom's

64
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:14,459
kids anyone the iceberg fans anywhere at

65
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:17,130
all would you buy that not y'all

66
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:21,810
wouldn't buy that fucking stupid Oh

67

[Music]

68
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,190
would you just listen to that Majesty

69
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:34,650
Celine Dion would be so proud if she was

70
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,959
still with us you can pick them Rose or

71
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,880
Jack but with my thorough understanding

72
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,330
of the film I'm gonna say that Rose is

73
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:45,300
probably the better option but what can

74
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,980
I say I've always been a fan of certain

75
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,380
doom let's go with Jack for some reason

76
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:52,320
Jack's name has like a blood splatter on

77
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,810
it is that supposed to be symbolic good

78
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:57,720
god China all about symbols couldn't

79
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,380
even make the alphabet do not give up do

80
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,900
not be discouraged you will be able to

81
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,180
get out of here it's not even poetic

82
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,350
it's just like they're on opposite

83
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:09,570
balconies yelling practical advice to

84
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:11,730
each other now I gotta say they knew

85
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:12,959
what they were doing with this one

86
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,459
starting us off right and everyone's

87
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:17,800
favorite scene next to the sex car

88
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,140
there so far so good I haven't even

89
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,610
touched a controller yet this is just

90
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:25,610
what he does when you stand still wipes

91
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:26,030
head

92
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:28,370
spits turns around repeat night this is

93
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:29,210
fantastic

94
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:32,600
oh wow okay that this game barely has

95
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:39,230
any controls apparently robot on Mars

96
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:41,150
right now be easier than this and to do

97
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:43,250
that you've incentive god damn signal

98
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,880
off the Sun in his robot back to earth I

99
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,010
better be less input leg what did I

100
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:51,080
expect you're just trying to get from

101
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,460
one end of the map to the other while

102
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,860
dodging rats and ghost barrels just

103
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:57,740
another day on the Titanic bonus I can't

104
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:00,410
wait I can't what get on the crate here

105
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:04,130
ah die okay tied to a rat probably

106
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:05,480
should have just waited to die the cool

107
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,100
away Jack alright it was just coming in

108
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:07,940
like 20 minutes

109
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,370
you blew it on a rack you blew it on a

110
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:12,860
fucking rat you can't even attack earth

111
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,260
you can I don't know how but they add to

112
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,640
stay true of the film didn't they all

113
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,200
right can you blame them this story

114
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,630
about love not violence and low on

115
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:22,190
hearts I'd better pick one up so the rat

116
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,330
doesn't get me again

117
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:30,140
Oh so hearts equals lifesaver

118
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:34,070
then what equals heart I can't even

119
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:36,380
begin to wrap my head around that I have

120
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,630
no idea how to replenish health and I

121
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,760
don't even think you can the next level

122
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,290
is the hull of the boat or something

123
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,180
wow I can't get past this part where do

124
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,580
you go seriously there's spikes on the

125
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,870
floor and there's no way around that I

126
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:52,820
can see miss sucks oh my god there she

127
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,640
goes I have never experienced the

128
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,260
continued scream that made me feel that

129
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,910
guilty I mean it's my fault that

130
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:02,930
happened I did the Titanic also I just

131
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,190
want to point out that the two choices

132
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:06,380
were given here are continue and start

133
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,390
guys stop you're giving me too many

134
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:08,840
options

135
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,640
I'm only one man here playing with Rose

136
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,320
is hilarious though she actually picks

137
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,300
up her dress to jump hey Game

138
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,860
Journalists look at that they're not

139
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,930
sexualizing your women for once isn't it

140
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:18,830
all you hoped for

141
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:22,550
so thank god that's over it's over right

142
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:25,310
zom there's not more right I mean surely

143
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:27,830
there weren't two companies crazy enough

144
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,090
to do something like this

145
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,009
right

146
00:06:32,009 --> 00:06:34,889
everyone at home are you sitting I mean

147
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:36,089
probably weird if you were standing

148
00:06:36,089 --> 00:06:38,159
watching this movie that some sort of

149
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:39,119
standing desk

150
00:06:39,119 --> 00:06:41,759
I think abandoned me don't you now there

151
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,080
was one more company that made a game

152
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,270
based off this Titanic movie craze and

153
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:47,219
it's not really possible to find it as a

154
00:06:47,219 --> 00:06:48,869
whole game or at least I couldn't it

155
00:06:48,869 --> 00:06:50,550
comes on this cartridge called the super

156
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:54,750

[Music]

158
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,920
oh let me tell you this games expertly

159
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,870
programmed when you boot this game up

160
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,340
you're presented with a random selection

161
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,110
screen that sometimes in Chinese

162
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,880
sometimes in English and sometimes

163
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,890
without the full game list if you're

164
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:15,570
lucky and you get the right screen with

165
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:17,070
all the games on it you won't even know

166
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,570
where to find the game because for some

167
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:20,040
reason that's been split up into two

168
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,290
pieces if you want to play as Jack it's

169
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:24,090
called hacker and if you want to play as

170
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:24,810
ROS

171
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:30,770
it's called heroine but why

172
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:46,550
tip tip Titanic it's time to play

173

[Music]

174
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:54,960
I would play a game on but I won't play

175
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,069
he

176
00:07:57,069 --> 00:08:00,469
my god what is that I bet you thought

177
00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:01,909
that was a typo huh the name of the

178
00:08:01,909 --> 00:08:03,889
episode hey guys look John made a

179
00:08:03,889 --> 00:08:05,419
mistake on the internet but there's a

180
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:06,710
bunch of comments down there already

181
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:09,050
about it but I'll tell you what I wish

182
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:11,000
that was a typo because no one wants

183
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,469
something like this for mankind the fact

184
00:08:12,469 --> 00:08:15,939
that this exists means we already lost

185
00:08:15,939 --> 00:08:18,889
why bother changing the name if you're

186
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:20,449
just going to steal the likenesses of

187
00:08:20,449 --> 00:08:22,969
the two main characters anyways let me

188
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:24,110
tell you it's a good thing they didn't

189
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:26,360
misspell Leonardo DiCaprio's face so we

190
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,009
would have really had a problem alright

191
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:29,360
let's begin

192
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,959
in 1912 there is a noble American girl

193
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:35,209
rose she tried to get away from her

194
00:08:35,209 --> 00:08:37,640
arranged married which is forced by her

195
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,430
mother at the same time she met Jack who

196
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:46,040
was the young man on Titanic since Rose

197
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,680
made a friend with Jack he lighted on

198
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,320
her life based on that car scene from

199
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,490
the movie I think he might have lighted

200
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,110
on a couple of other things too

201
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:57,320
they were also fall in love with each

202
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,990
other it made up a very touching and

203
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:03,199
tragic love story this is mostly just

204
00:09:03,199 --> 00:09:09,170
tragic oh oh hey Jack I know the ship

205
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:10,699
sinking but we got to keep our cool here

206
00:09:10,699 --> 00:09:11,930
you want to add to the list of

207
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:14,209
casualties I don't think it was the

208
00:09:14,209 --> 00:09:16,670
iceberg that killed all those people

209
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:20,089
I think it was Jack well the first thing

210
00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:21,350
when I saw the movie the first thing I

211
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:22,730
said at the theater I interrupted the

212
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:25,070
whole group I said where's the fight in

213
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:27,380
well to my surprise this game actually

214
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,360
controls well the fighting is tight and

215
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,070
responsive it's pretty satisfying the

216
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,050
punch dude he can finally punch the rats

217
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:36,529
this time around that's good is he is he

218
00:09:36,529 --> 00:09:37,970
reading a newspaper

219
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:42,230
oh he's drawing get it cuz he draws in

220
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:45,110
the movie remember this just definitely

221
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:48,800
accurate to the movie remember excuse me

222
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,899
lieutenant I think you may have a

223
00:09:50,899 --> 00:09:52,940
well-endowed man standing in one of your

224
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,649
grandfather clocks I just thought I'd

225
00:09:54,649 --> 00:09:57,829
warn you oh the chef's fightin all the

226
00:09:57,829 --> 00:09:59,660
chef's man I'll tell you what that's bad

227
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,940
chefs are natural pacifists you piss a

228
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,370
chef off you've done

229
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:06,640
something wrong oh shit sorry about that

230
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,920
I didn't see you standing there what can

231
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,640
I say

232
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,220
tensions were high in most games that

233
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,260
involve burly men destroying everything

234
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,910
a health powerup would consist of

235
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,470
something like a turkey leg or a roast

236
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:19,810
chicken but in this game you pick up

237
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:23,650
lobster and wine the busiest of beat two

238
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:25,660
mommies eventually you get to fight a

239
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,640
boss that's essentially if mr. t was

240
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,500
infused with Donatello from the Ninja

241
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,210
Turtles now that's a pretty dangerous

242
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:34,540
combo right there all right run the next

243
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,020
level

244
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:38,070
no all right okay hold the phone rats

245
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,540
understandable that's a bit weird but I

246
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,640
guess I can see but cobras unless this

247
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,230
ship was headed to a snake charming

248
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:45,670
convention this is absolutely

249
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:46,780
unreasonable

250
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,520
hey okay it's no wonder this ship went

251
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,080
down between Jack beating up every

252
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,660
capable person running it in goddamn

253
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,940
Cobras everywhere I can hear the captain

254
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,800
right now yes I'm looking out for

255
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,660
icebergs but currently I'm fending off a

256
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,790
nest of Cobras and a very aggressive man

257
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,620
from Wisconsin also I love when you

258
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,180
punch the Cobras they react like they

259
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,290
didn't even see it coming

260
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,120
they're just like whoa I'm out that was

261
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,440
a bad one yeah okay

262
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,360
the life savers try to kill you in this

263
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,790
game I'm pretty sure this is the literal

264
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,590
opposite of what a lifesaver is named

265
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:17,470
for and supposed to do how did both of

266
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:19,840
these games fail to use life savers as

267
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,000
some sort of appropriate object if

268
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,800
you're asking me that is proof of a

269
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,690
grand deity right there or maybe the

270
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:28,450
proof of the lack of one oh yeah that's

271
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:30,130
right I remember the part where Jack

272
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:31,810
fights Herman Munster on top of a

273
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:34,060
smaller ship on top of the Titanic that

274
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:37,330
was the best part I don't even know

275
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,950
what's this guy's problem he attacks you

276
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:40,870
by firing a gun angrily and thrusting

277
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:42,280
his dick at you I don't know we're in

278
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,660
international waters I guess anything

279
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,460
goes but once you beat this guy he's

280
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,830
like you have bested me here is the deed

281
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:51,130
proving you soul man 19 ten times were

282
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:53,440
weird this time around we're playing as
