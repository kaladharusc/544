[Music]

2
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,780
forty-two seconds of Disney logos my

3
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:13,209
name's Ralph narration so the plot of

4
00:00:13,209 --> 00:00:14,439
this videogame is that Ralph Fiennes

5
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:17,470
stumps to sleep in and a bulldozer comes

6
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,119
by they remove this one stump for some

7
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,470
stupid reason and then Ralph who

8
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:22,150
apparently has very specific sleeping

9
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:24,070
needs gets angry and destroys entire

10
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:25,720
apartment buildings but the coke

11
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,509
everybody was doing in the 80s this is

12
00:00:28,509 --> 00:00:29,710
exactly what I used to yell at my

13
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:31,089
college girlfriend shortly before

14
00:00:31,089 --> 00:00:32,680
ruining sex if he was a regular

15
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,899
contractor carpenter you would not be

16
00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:36,730
able to fix the damage that I do as

17
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:38,800
quickly wreck-it Ralph would be amazing

18
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,690
at cinema since the movie speeds up time

19
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:42,100
during the sequence to show how much

20
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,480
everything's changed over the years but

21
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,460
hardly anything changes he'll a

22
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:47,320
realistic time lapse would be to show

23
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,820
this arcade going out of business for a

24
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,260
few years of becoming a Ruby Tuesday

25
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:51,490
it's certainly better than keeping all

26
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:52,930
these outdated games in the same spot

27
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:55,150
for 30 years without any turnover also

28
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:56,890
if you look closely the fix-it felix

29
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,420
game apparently only has one level

30
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:59,830
there's apparently nowhere to go after

31
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:04,360
this I see you got some Toy Story in my

32
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,710
wreckit-ralph once again there's

33
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:07,420
virtually no way these game characters

34
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,340
could do this on scene but hey I just

35
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,380
beliefs been drunk before so maybe I can

36
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,420
accept at the start since everybody in

37
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,220
the video game universe realizes this is

38
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,440
all a show why is Ralph ostracize what

39
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,909
this movie is saying is that our human

40
00:01:18,909 --> 00:01:20,409
projection of Ralph's villainy

41
00:01:20,409 --> 00:01:21,850
translates to the characters in the

42
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:23,380
video game world but meanwhile ruined

43
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,180
Ken can be battling and decide to get a

44
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:26,380
drink together after the arcade is

45
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:27,760
closed because they know it's all

46
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,180
make-believe

47
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:30,729
I am Zangief I'm bad guy is he though in

48
00:01:30,729 --> 00:01:32,770
the original Street Fighter 2 zingy was

49
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:33,850
just another character you could play

50
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:36,370
just like guile or E Honda or Blanca it

51
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:37,600
was one of those boss characters that

52
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,770
you couldn't play until a champion

53
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:40,390
edition came out what makes an gif a

54
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:43,090
bigger bad guy than say Ken chun-li or

55
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:47,770
dhalsim dhalsim I am bad honestly when

56
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:49,780
and why did we convince ourselves that

57
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,520
addiction recovery just had to include

58
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,590
unison group chants so they were all in

59
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:54,940
the pac-man game for that bad anon

60
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,229
meeting but in just a few moments

61
00:01:56,229 --> 00:01:57,880
everyone's gonna act like going into a

62
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,520
game not your own AKA game jumping is a

63
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,470
bad thing but clearly the act itself is

64
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:04,299
okay if the circumstances are right so

65
00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:05,860
this video game subway travels through a

66
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,659
surge protector where all the videogame

67
00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:08,830
characters can go back to their homes

68
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,689
but what happens if the game is plugged

69
00:02:10,689 --> 00:02:12,310
in elsewhere surely not every game in

70
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:14,050
the arcade hooks up to this one surge

71
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,180
protector also even though that can't be

72
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,860
all the games in the arcade it's

73
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,960
too many plugs holy hell this is a fire

74
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,640
hazard if ever I saw one how is this

75
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,710
place not burned down already named Lera

76
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:26,080
Croft haha but how does ralph know about

77
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,060
Laura Croft a character who was never an

78
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,890
arcade fixture yeah bring any fruit with

79
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:33,040
you no no no fruit this works I like how

80
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,600
the creatures here run away from Ralph

81
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,430
because he's a bad guy but that t-rex

82
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,320
back there isn't scaring anyone he spent

83
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,610
so much time on Easter eggs you forgot

84
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:44,230
about consistency you don't regenerate I

85
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,700
have no doubt about this but it does

86
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,410
raise this question there are multiple

87
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:48,760
copies of these arcade games all around

88
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,410
the world right there are thousands of

89
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:52,870
other record roms pac-man's etc and did

90
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,310
they all go through existential crises

91
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,230
the nice landers know how to party they

92
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:57,130
even got Skrillex

93
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:58,989
but I'm still left wondering why are

94
00:02:58,989 --> 00:03:00,370
there so many of them there are a finite

95
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:01,989
number of windows in the felix game and

96
00:03:01,989 --> 00:03:03,790
way more citizens here at this party

97
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:05,410
than windows granted there's half a

98
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:07,000
boiled egg and a piece of bacon at the

99
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,530
Stan's so maybe we've got some cross

100
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:10,209
game celebrating going on here which I

101
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:12,220
would then sin for just being more game

102
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,870
jumping being casually overlooked by a

103
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,160
movie that screams about how bad game

104
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,020
jumping is you're just the bad guy who

105
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,270
wrecks the bill view again what are all

106
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:20,560
these people pissed about are they the

107
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,730
only video game characters who don't

108
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:23,320
know they're in a game do they really

109
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,970
live their lives inside this machine and

110
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:26,290
get upset when ralph comes in to wreck

111
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,580
their home do they not realize that it

112
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,630
all goes back to normal once the game is

113
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,820
over cuz with these assholes

114
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:33,670
oh come on this is the lost and found

115
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,950
inside the Tempur machine if you lose

116
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,450
your life outside of the game you don't

117
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,010
regenerate but apparently you can lose

118
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,750
your tempers place and just get it right

119
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,519
back the scene of eight quarters to play

120
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:44,350
doesn't exaggerate enough this is burnt

121
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,209
of arcades diet by the way it's made

122
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:49,540
your mama's Popeyes him lasting even

123
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,280
this long without being found out it's

124
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,310
kind of ridiculous yep there were two

125
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,959
big-budget movies in 2012 that made

126
00:03:55,959 --> 00:03:57,940
weird Mother Hubbard references this and

127
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,320
the Amazing Spiderman how did that even

128
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,810
happen I guess this is her first time

129
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:03,220
playing this game good thing too because

130
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,110
what if a hero's duty expert was playing

131
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:06,519
right now wouldn't that person report

132
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:08,410
this strange bizarre weirdness alright

133
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:09,310
pussywillows

134
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,959
Howard Stern called he's pretty sure

135
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,400
you're stealing his bit I'm mostly just

136
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,079
wondering why a family movie from Disney

137
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:15,430
felt the need to make this joke at all

138
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:19,959
go away you have to go pretty far out of

139
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,700
your way and money seeking activities to

140
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,590
end up drawing product placement where's

141
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,540
Ralph you should be wrecking the

142
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,370
building okay so now you're telling me

143
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,110
that the innocent apartment dwellers do

144
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,310
know Ralph is supposed to wreck the

145
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,210
building and that's his job

146
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:32,530
because you can't have these same

147
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:34,240
characters pissed off when he doesn't do

148
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,080
it Ralph

149
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,669
probably fell asleep in the washroom of

150
00:04:36,669 --> 00:04:38,770
tappers again so when Ralph falls asleep

151
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:40,539
of tappers does he usually not show up

152
00:04:40,539 --> 00:04:41,919
does this Ralph not showing up in the

153
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,690
game thing happen all the time and if so

154
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:44,830
why panic at all

155
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,479
Felix speaking Qbert it's the single

156
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,009
biggest view this movie has to offer

157
00:04:48,009 --> 00:04:50,229
Qbert as a game was so infuriating I

158
00:04:50,229 --> 00:04:51,880
can't even enjoy this guy he's climbing

159
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,380
this wall almost like he totally forgot

160
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,789
that if he dies in this game he dies

161
00:04:54,789 --> 00:04:56,530
forever and can't respawn at his own

162
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:57,849
game again I'm just saying I'd be

163
00:04:57,849 --> 00:05:00,130
nervous about basically everything but

164
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:04,110
especially free climbing skyscrapers

165
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:07,270
they only played one game they just open

166
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:09,400
the arcade before this one game that was

167
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,199
this being arcade already closed grace

168
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,280
under pressure and above all dignity wow

169
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,229
I admit the things this game narrator is

170
00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:19,210
listing make for hilarious juxtaposition

171
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:20,680
with the actual actions of Ralph they

172
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,030
aren't things a game like this would

173
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,440
consider virtues in its best player

174
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,630
dignity it's a halo ripoff dignity

175
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,979
cartoon character flying in the air and

176
00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:39,159
screaming in slow motion cliche how did

177
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:40,570
the metal get all the way back here when

178
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:42,520
Ralph ejected he went backwards but that

179
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,380
means the metal had to come off his neck

180
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,030
and fly an additional thousand feet or

181
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:47,919
so and magically hook higher up onto

182
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,280
another candy cane tree now it's my let

183
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,750
the record show that in Ralph's defense

184
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,639
vanellope was pretty much a selfish jerk

185
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,630
to him right from the start

186
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,310
yes she does want a gold coin so she

187
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:59,050
could race but stealing is stealing

188
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:01,240
cybus would chew up that game faster

189
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,250
than a chicken hawk and a Koopa crippled

190
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:06,070
roosters force simile aside no you're

191
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:08,680
wrong it takes ages for the side bugs to

192
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,180
become an actual threat and sugar rush

193
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,400
without a beacon to stop them they'll

194
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,370
consume sugar rush sounds I really began

195
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:17,169
programming to me it's not her fault

196
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:19,270
she's programmed with the most tragic

197
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:21,580
backstory ever if the program is aware

198
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,840
of the fact that it's a program and its

199
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,610
actions are dictated by the code isn't

200
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:26,349
that the definition of AI is this the

201
00:06:26,349 --> 00:06:28,180
singularity you die outside your game

202
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,830
you don't regenerate you keep telling us

203
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,300
that but we haven't seen it once

204
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,460
segregated seating imagine a world where

205
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,960
you go to a NASCAR race and are forced

206
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,310
to sit with only the people who taste

207
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:38,430
exactly like you do oh hell

208
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:41,520
rightful ruler Mac Eric tur somehow went

209
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,050
back in time from the emoji movie and

210
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:44,790
inspired itself and now it's its own

211
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:48,420
grandpa casual cannibalism this gold

212
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,800
medal from an entirely different game

213
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,450
works as a gold coin in this game

214
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:53,940
there's no way that I am racing with a

215
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:54,600
glitch

216
00:06:54,600 --> 00:07:02,520
that's glitch estates gone you know it's

217
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,590
it's nothing but code now

218
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,300
so now video game code makes a

219
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,260
difference in this world it really

220
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,090
hasn't up until this point I'll lock you

221
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:12,180
in my function function fun dungeon

222
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,730
you know it's a play on words in a candy

223
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:16,590
beast race game though wasn't a sweet

224
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:18,660
space jail pun make more sense like the

225
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,640
pecan can or the jail cell or the

226
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,950
Twinkie clinky holy the bullying is so

227
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,300
over the top in this movie I'm wondering

228
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,560
if Stephen King did an uncredited

229
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,820
rewrite Robin and sugar rush for half a

230
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,260
day and is already speaking and setting

231
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,120
appropriate metaphors and insults the

232
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,570
vibe there Laffy Taffy they're attracted

233
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:38,040
to whatever makes them laugh no one

234
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,360
knows why they were programmed into this

235
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,070
game but they're perfect decks mocking

236
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,900
us in fact what the hell is all this in

237
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,190
a game where the objective is to race

238
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:46,140
and the thing that is lost in all this

239
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,880
is what statistically it's these Laffy

240
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,820
Taffy's are i would send this sleeping

241
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,710
guard at the kart bakery but then what

242
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:54,540
upsets me more is the bakery needs agar

243
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,860
in the first place it's almost like

244
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,390
sugar rush is the most realized video

245
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,860
game in the entire arcade they built the

246
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,300
whole world inside here that has nothing

247
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,010
to do with the game itself so if another

248
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:03,540
people it's nothing but trash into the

249
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,250
mixing bowl but when Ralph goes to fix

250
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,570
everything the trash magically

251
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,460
disappears except for the TV hello you

252
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,930
can have magically disappearing trash

253
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,580
because it's a video game but you cannot

254
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,590
keep the TV if all the trash is going to

255
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:14,670
disappear once you get the right

256
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:18,690
ingredients okay yes this is a terrible

257
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:20,790
race card but I don't see how that book

258
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:22,770
we just went through could ever yield a

259
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:26,880
car more Road worthy than this one diet

260
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:31,160
cola in a game called sugar rush I

261
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:35,460
really want to I know I'm a racer I can

262
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,440
feel it in my color she's right of

263
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,480
course and unfortunately because in the

264
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,980
context of what has happened so far to

265
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:41,430
this point

266
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:43,410
Ralph is also right the movies diet coke

267
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:45,450
and mentos gank is super interesting to

268
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:47,160
me it's both inspired as hell yet

269
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,680
simultaneously dated if anything it's a

270
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,970
lesson to take time to make

271
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,649
certain you want to write off our video

272
00:08:52,649 --> 00:08:57,689
into your hopefully timeless movie they

273
00:08:57,689 --> 00:08:58,829
just left in the game

274
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:00,329
so the programmers of sugar rush we're

275
00:09:00,329 --> 00:09:02,459
planning some sugar free bonus level and

276
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,199
decided not to include it at the last

277
00:09:04,199 --> 00:09:05,550
minute but just let the code sitting

278
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,660
there by yourself

279
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,540
it's almost garbage around you yeah I

280
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,129
mean everyone here says I'm just a

281
00:09:11,129 --> 00:09:12,959
mistake and that I wasn't even supposed

282
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,389
to exist what do you expect movie has

283
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:18,360
balls man balls part 1 - punching me

284
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,769
here with Ralph's realization and how

285
00:09:19,769 --> 00:09:21,180
similar his situation is to hers and

286
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,579
then her spelling out how I and probably

287
00:09:23,579 --> 00:09:25,170
most kids felt at some point during

288
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:27,660
childhood - sins removal for the fields

289
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:31,199
movie but you're you really don't know

290
00:09:31,199 --> 00:09:32,519
anything do you

291
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:35,519
glitches can't leave their games whoa no

292
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,139
need for the attitude since you seem to

293
00:09:37,139 --> 00:09:38,759
understand his relative naivete his

294
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:40,439
ignorance shouldn't bring score also

295
00:09:40,439 --> 00:09:41,879
learning this about glitches makes me

296
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:43,560
supremely happy knowing swordless link

297
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,870
is forever stuck in n64 ocarina of time

298
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,819
earlier he jumped slightly into the air

299
00:09:47,819 --> 00:09:49,800
and landed and that caused the Mentos to

300
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,019
drop into the diet coke pit but this man

301
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:54,089
no vibrations at all here I'm just gonna

302
00:09:54,089 --> 00:09:56,189
call this in Konami code pandering you

303
00:09:56,189 --> 00:09:57,600
want to get people unreasonably excited

304
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,740
about something showed knowledge of the

305
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,180
Konami code it's now the secret

306
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,379
handshake for people who played the

307
00:10:01,379 --> 00:10:03,180
original contra and likely have nothing

308
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,040
else in common one of the things it's

309
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,529
not like the others okay now that we've

310
00:10:07,529 --> 00:10:09,420
broken this game down to its very code

311
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,309
how though did this metal get accepted

312
00:10:11,309 --> 00:10:12,120
into the winners Cup

313
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,009
it's Barty Crouch jr. behind this you

314
00:10:14,009 --> 00:10:16,439
know like a verb what vomit in a burp

315
00:10:16,439 --> 00:10:18,180
together no one will be seated during

316
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,680
the Adam Sandler portion of the movie

317
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,959
will be put out of all I forgot all my

318
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:24,059
subjects will be homeless how would they

319
00:10:24,059 --> 00:10:25,410
even leave the game before the arcade

320
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:26,399
unplugs the machine

321
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,509
think about this for a second if they

322
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:28,769
unplug the machine immediately there's

323
00:10:28,769 --> 00:10:30,329
no way for the characters to escape to

324
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:31,920
the surge protector but if they're left

325
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,449
plugged in long enough to leave before

326
00:10:33,449 --> 00:10:35,370
the unplugging who's to say the machine

327
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:37,019
wouldn't get plugged back in does the

328
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:38,639
game now have no characters after that

329
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:40,110
and what about all those times there's a

330
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,730
power outage or someone unplug the

331
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:43,470
machine waits for 30 seconds and plugs

332
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:44,670
it back in where's this movie saying

333
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,829
that being in a machine when it's unplug

334
00:10:46,829 --> 00:10:48,629
would essentially be like death because

335
00:10:48,629 --> 00:10:50,009
then they wouldn't have any of their old

336
00:10:50,009 --> 00:10:51,389
memories when the machine got plugged

337
00:10:51,389 --> 00:10:52,800
back in I don't think you can present

338
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,050
unplugging as a woman outcome situation

339
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:56,910
can we talk for a second character has

340
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:57,870
something important to tell another

341
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,370
character but is interrupted for some

342
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:00,720
stupid that will make the discussion

343
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,759
impossible cliche I'm moving ass in here

344
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:04,319
but only because somebody is cutting

345
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:04,769
onions

346
00:11:04,769 --> 00:11:06,300
your mind is probably doing so for good

347
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,160
intentions I'm really not okay about it

348
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,269
but I still recognize the quality

349
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:11,040
storytelling and emotional beats or the

350
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,449
fact that sometimes dishes need onions

351
00:11:12,449 --> 00:11:14,519
why are you telling me that metal is an

352
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:16,679
actual physical thing that can actually

353
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:18,509
physically affect the outside world this

354
00:11:18,509 --> 00:11:20,189
is like when neo stop the sentence with

355
00:11:20,189 --> 00:11:22,199
his mind in the real world only carrots

356
00:11:22,199 --> 00:11:24,059
presented as just a yeah that can happen

357
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:31,170
kind of thing attendant decide spoopy

358
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:32,850
yada yada as computer code worse than

359
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:34,889
the 90s film hackers did because she

360
00:11:34,889 --> 00:11:37,350
crosses the finish line the game will

361
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:39,629
reset and she won't be a glitch anymore

362
00:11:39,629 --> 00:11:41,160
that seems arbitrary is that how

363
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,749
programs work a glitch crosses the

364
00:11:42,749 --> 00:11:44,129
finish line and the whole game resets

365
00:11:44,129 --> 00:11:45,749
and all that damage King candy did

366
00:11:45,749 --> 00:11:55,980
somehow magically comes undone first

367
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,019
world problems is this society forcing

368
00:11:58,019 --> 00:11:59,819
all these spectators to sleep inside the

369
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:01,410
grandstands every night god this place

370
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:03,749
is oh here's the thing movies always do

371
00:12:03,749 --> 00:12:05,850
with races where the hero starts out so

372
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,110
looking far behind that there's

373
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,850
literally no way they could ever catch

374
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:10,980
up let alone win and yet of course they

375
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:15,629
always do they cannot hear each other

376
00:12:15,629 --> 00:12:16,170
damn it

377
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:17,579
even if their engines are made out of

378
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:19,470
candy they still make noise damn it

379
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:21,259
that's I bub you brought with you

380
00:12:21,259 --> 00:12:23,369
multiplied of all the things in this

381
00:12:23,369 --> 00:12:24,899
movie that could have been cut it's the

382
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:26,759
psy bug subplot sure we could a bit of

383
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:28,439
fun with Felix and Calhoun out of it but

384
00:12:28,439 --> 00:12:29,790
the main story of vanellope trying to

385
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,589
get reinstated into sugar rush is so

386
00:12:31,589 --> 00:12:32,639
much more interesting that could have

387
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,899
simply made this about getting the metal

388
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:37,769
back and it would've been fine sweet

389
00:12:37,769 --> 00:12:40,410
mother monkey milk it's almost like that

390
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:42,480
mindless bug new king candy was a bad

391
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,709
guy much in need of a comeuppance

392
00:12:43,709 --> 00:12:46,230
without a beacon there's no way to stop

393
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:49,799
these monsters because we're all gonna

394
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:51,299
tell Calhoun what he plans to do here

395
00:12:51,299 --> 00:12:53,189
and maybe they should set a timetable in

396
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,869
case they need to blow the exit Oh

397
00:12:54,869 --> 00:13:02,519
two ladies go I would just like to know

398
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:04,379
how turbo got eaten by a SCI bug and

399
00:13:04,379 --> 00:13:05,970
that somehow turned him into a mutant

400
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:07,589
let's not forget the turbo is like 30

401
00:13:07,589 --> 00:13:09,179
year-old programming code and the SCI

402
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:10,439
bugs are fairly new so how does their

403
00:13:10,439 --> 00:13:11,699
programming mesh together at all

404
00:13:11,699 --> 00:13:13,709
also Agent Smith moth movie just the

405
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:15,329
fact that he's the villain and he's code

406
00:13:15,329 --> 00:13:16,980
that has grown too strong inside a

407
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:17,870
computer that

408
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:18,950
to be enough but there's also the

409
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:20,779
parallel of inexplicable existence and

410
00:13:20,779 --> 00:13:22,400
powers Agent Smith just refused to die

411
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,140
according to the sequel's so he got to

412
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:26,270
stay in or come back to the matrix only

413
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:28,730
now he's got duplication superpowers is

414
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:29,450
that all about

415
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:30,529
neo could have a realization about

416
00:13:30,529 --> 00:13:32,029
himself and his abilities and then grow

417
00:13:32,029 --> 00:13:34,010
stronger because he is human but Smith

418
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:36,589
is just cold and cold that's all I mean

419
00:13:36,589 --> 00:13:38,330
wait movie are we talking about again

420
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:41,390
I'm bad that's good

421
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:42,740
look no one loves this movie more than

422
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:45,260
me no one but this is still a discount

423
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,850
Iron Giant Superman moment here and

424
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:48,200
denying it only makes you a passionate

425
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,390
liar also it was one thing to have a

426
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:51,920
sort of reference to the whole Mentos

427
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,570
coke thing but to base your entire

428
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:55,550
climax around it what does a sudden

429
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:57,230
grimace sound like because that's the

430
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:59,210
sound I'm making phallic symbols after

431
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:00,740
all the destruction and the violence and

432
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,510
death and that race ending abruptly this

433
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,460
should probably not work right code may

434
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,380
say I'm a princess but I know who I

435
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,510
really am Ralph I'm a racer with the

436
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:11,089
greatest superpower I like the idea that

437
00:14:11,089 --> 00:14:12,680
Penelope isn't the character the game

438
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,120
programmed her to be there's a lot of

439
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,830
nature versus nurture type of arguments

440
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:17,150
we could get into in that kind of line

441
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,560
but if she was programmed to be the

442
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,450
princess why does the arcade cabinet

443
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:21,740
show her as a racer someone on the

444
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:22,910
marketing team disagreed with the

445
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:28,400
programmers on that did this our bill

446
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,020
say that once vanellope crossed the

447
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,339
finish line everything would be reset

448
00:14:31,339 --> 00:14:33,170
and she'd stop being a glitch how is she

449
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:34,940
able to still do this glitch if that's

450
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,800
the case we asked them to help us out on

451
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,170
the bonus levels Jesus to the humans who

452
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,120
play these ever wonder why characters

453
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,740
from other video games suddenly show up

454
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,089
in a thirty-year-old machine you know

455
00:14:44,089 --> 00:14:45,440
there's got to be a Billy Mitchell here

456
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,330
who knows fix-it Felix inside and out

457
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:48,890
and the inclusion of Qbert characters

458
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:50,120
would be so strange that it would

459
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,920
immediately be newsworthy like aliens

460
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,779
landing on earth newsworthy I'm telling

461
00:14:53,779 --> 00:14:55,459
you guys we haven't been this popular in

462
00:14:55,459 --> 00:14:56,990
years the idea that a thirty-year-old

463
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:58,580
game would suddenly surge in popularity

464
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,830
just because cuber characters are in it

465
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:06,320
is goddamn silly
