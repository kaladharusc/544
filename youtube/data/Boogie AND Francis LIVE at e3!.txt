00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:54,090
all right we're gonna start day two but

31
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,479
I want to show you something here I

32
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,710
created a nice little workstation I

33
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,540
brought one of my yetis from home I've

34
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,760
got my nice powerful laptop I got my

35
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,460
Logitech c920 webcam and I've been

36
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,940
filming from here I thought it's gonna

37
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,040
have to be either or either I did my

38
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,080
videos at home or I attended e3 and I

39
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,880
wouldn't be able to do my videos nope

40
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,350
I've just been doing it I've been doing

41
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:19,110
10-hour days at the livestream and then

42
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,370
I've been coming back to my room and

43
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,230
filming videos for you guys but I knew

44
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:23,130
they weren't gonna be as good of quality

45
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,360
I knew they weren't gonna look as good

46
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,280
they still sound pretty good but I know

47
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,209
they weren't gonna look as good because

48
00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:28,110
they don't have professional lighting

49
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:30,209
and stuff that can travel with me but

50
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:31,860
you guys are still really enjoying the

51
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,380
videos I'm really excited about it I was

52
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,640
so excited that this isn't working out

53
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,430
look at me wrong I'm really tired

54
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:41,580
I'm really stressed but this is one of

55
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,739
the best times in my life I will say I'm

56
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:46,080
amazed at my mobility because I had to

57
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,019
walk so much yesterday and whereas I did

58
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:51,480
bring the stupid little Marc cart and I

59
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,760
do use it to get from here to the studio

60
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,040
I don't really use it it just stays

61
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,290
parked I walk all that I need to walk I

62
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,780
do everything that I need to do I stand

63
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,810
in lines I stood up to interview fans

64
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:05,700
it's just been it's been an amazing

65
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,110
experience the last five weeks of

66
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,700
physical therapy has got me into a

67
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,260
position where I'm really comfortable

68
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,120
moving and I'm really comfortable doing

69
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,519
stuff I've never been so tired and I've

70
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:16,920
never been so sore but I've also never

71
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,250
been this happy to be tired and sore so

72
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,290

VidCon to meet some of you guys but

168
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:48,810

00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:49,950
there's supposed to be a meeting with

170
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:51,360
senior project read that's actually

171
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,820
today someone go get to play cyberpunk

172
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,700
I'm gonna play we happy few I'm gonna

173
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,920
meet some more fans I'm gonna talk some

174
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,770

175
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:03,510
later night there's a YouTube party and

176
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,740
a YouTube dinner and I hope to get some

177
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,810
footage for that as well

178
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:09,000
time will tell a lot of the times the

179
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,170
reason it's been less footage in this

180
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:11,580
video than I wanted there to be is a lot

181
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,140
of the times they just don't you pull in

182
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,420
your camera out it's really weird but I

183
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,339
understand I understand it's it's more

184
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:20,010
for you to write about then - then - to

185
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:21,899
show but I've been trying to get

186
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:23,250
gameplay captures and been trying to get

187
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,380
everything I could it's just hard to get

188
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,510
it I don't think they'd let me turn the

189
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:30,149
camera on all at cyberpunk in fact I

190
00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:32,610
think you have to sign an NDA to not

191
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:35,579
talk about what you see and how am I

192
00:09:35,579 --> 00:09:41,520
going to not talk about that game after

193
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,939
it's in your way

194
00:09:43,939 --> 00:09:46,980
Leila

195
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,520
yeah in your March 3

196
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:57,430
oh my

197
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,620
yeah - Mike Proximus mine and I'm

198
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,310
responsible for killing you cyberbunker

199
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,690
so after

200
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:09,540
playing wherever big machine

201
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,070
you're getting to see the demo of

202
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:12,660
cyberpunk 2077

203
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:16,470
but we're here with the actual narrators

204
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:18,510
and you said chew my ear off he's been

205
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:20,280
working directly with him to create the

206
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:25,920
game time and so overall what do you

207
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,529
think the decision is this year

208
00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:32,239
I believe it fucking real okay so ho

209
00:10:32,239 --> 00:10:34,529
stupidly excited that you say that

210
00:10:34,529 --> 00:10:35,789
because when you're playing when you're

211
00:10:35,789 --> 00:10:37,999
playing the game we all have like a very

212
00:10:37,999 --> 00:10:39,869
personal vision of what it looks like

213
00:10:39,869 --> 00:10:41,249
it's it's all in the paper it's all

214
00:10:41,249 --> 00:10:44,129
tight straight and your vision there's

215
00:10:44,129 --> 00:10:45,599
way more high and weighs more than

216
00:10:45,599 --> 00:10:47,969
anybody else's message here but now

217
00:10:47,969 --> 00:10:49,589
you're gonna get to see what's been in

218
00:10:49,589 --> 00:11:00,000
my head joyeux myself
