1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:16,980
hey guys how's it going del Ruth here

2
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,109
bringing you another rapid fire style

3
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:21,300
review this time for the game immortal

4
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,550
unchained portal is a third-person

5
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:26,519
combat action RPG developed and designed

6
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:29,550
by toad man interactive mortals story is

7
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:30,960
pretty simple to follow you're a

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,730
prisoner that has been confined to a

9
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:34,860
citadel like fortress for a vast amount

10
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,690
of time released when the galaxy is

11
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:38,550
dealing with a massive threat and all

12
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:41,160
other options have been exhausted you

13
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,960
the prisoner are tasked with restoring

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,300
balance and power to the universe by

15
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,550
activating a bunch of magical space orbs

16
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,320
and powering up the deity of the prime

17
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,110
race avoiding any spoilers generally

18
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:53,820
achieved by stomping around and beating

19
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,949
up bosses I really don't want to say

20
00:00:55,949 --> 00:00:59,340
this as I'm fully aware of the mean but

21
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,289
the direct comparison in this game is

22
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:04,439
far too obvious to not say it and I said

23
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:05,970
it multiple times while streaming it

24
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:09,240
this game is almost a carbon copy of

25
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,820
dark souls blood it has guns almost

26
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,409
every single facet of this game is a

27
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:15,840
direct copy or directly influenced by

28
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,299
Dark Souls you have bonfires called

29
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:21,299
obelisks souls Kalb it's almost

30
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:24,330
identical weapon upgrading a stat system

31
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:26,610
with weapon scaling stats and of course

32
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,979
a complete lack of a map again I'm not

33
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:31,200
just referencing a meme this game feels

34
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,180
to me like they took the technical

35
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,009
concept of Dark Souls gave it a

36
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:37,259
different in darker skin and then failed

37
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:38,970
to innovate it in any major way

38
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,729
whatsoever design wise and visually

39
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:43,680
immortal unchained is a completely dark

40
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,600
and grim mess with very little I would

41
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,520
consider visually stunning or impressive

42
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,470
in its own right the game doesn't look

43
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,299
awful but half the time you're

44
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:52,979
hard-pressed to see what it looks good

45
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:54,630
with it seeming like the brightness bar

46
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:56,520
has been dragged completely down to zero

47
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,770
enemy designs in this game visually are

48
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,420
almost remarkably identical to each

49
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,880
other in almost every sense all enemies

50
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,680
generally follow the same concept of

51
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,750
being robotica abominations of flesh and

52
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,819
steel with a couple of glowy bits thrown

53
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:10,560
in here and their sizes on these enemies

54
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:10,899
are

55
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:12,610
and of course but there are almost no

56
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,409
deviations from the beginning enemies

57
00:02:14,409 --> 00:02:16,390
you fight to the endgame ones causing a

58
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:18,760
distinct lack of variety between locals

59
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,560
almost every enemy in the game features

60
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,689
the exact same visual weak point as well

61
00:02:22,689 --> 00:02:25,269
a glowy bit located on the back but it

62
00:02:25,269 --> 00:02:26,560
seeming like there was little to no

63
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,720
effort put into that of course I'll give

64
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,340
them credit and say that the weak spot

65
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,260
has a different shape every so often but

66
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,150
the concept is a copy-pasted thing

67
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,769
throughout the entire game on all of the

68
00:02:35,769 --> 00:02:38,349
mods the guns too aren't incredibly

69
00:02:38,349 --> 00:02:40,090
visually underwhelming they have the

70
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,739
chance with this dark sci-fi Norse

71
00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:43,420
godlike universe to go and make some

72
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,250
truly incredible and unique weapon

73
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,810
designs but instead opted to take

74
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:48,970
real-world weapons and simply tack some

75
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:51,489
glowy bits onto them I'm not joking

76
00:02:51,489 --> 00:02:53,170
they literally took things like the

77
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:55,120
Kriss vector and added glowing circles

78
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,680
on it and declared that it was a space

79
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,859
gun in fact 99% of the weapons I found

80
00:02:59,859 --> 00:03:01,629
in the game were all direct real world

81
00:03:01,629 --> 00:03:03,579
ports of guns with a few obvious slight

82
00:03:03,579 --> 00:03:05,859
edits there was from what I could tell

83
00:03:05,859 --> 00:03:08,170
no attempt at designing unique weaponry

84
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:09,700
specific to the universe it was

85
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,680
incredibly disappointing world design is

86
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,810
also incredibly uninspired most

87
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:16,209
locations are entirely dark with the

88
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:18,879
exception of one planet area and don't

89
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,859
feature anything visually impressive or

90
00:03:20,859 --> 00:03:23,290
memorable that I can recall if I hadn't

91
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,150
actually been using a teleporter to move

92
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:27,220
between locations or at this point I

93
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,409
could say bonfire I'd feel like I was on

94
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:30,730
the same planet from start to finish

95
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:33,370
these worlds felt like complete mazes

96
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:35,290
with little to no Direction something

97
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:37,060
which was far overdone and becomes an

98
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,650
immense point of frustration throughout

99
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,449
your play you know yeah if you want to

100
00:03:40,449 --> 00:03:42,159
get loot from the crates tossed around

101
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:43,720
all throughout the levels you're gonna

102
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,849
have to backtrack a ton as you will not

103
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:47,229
have the keys to open them all until

104
00:03:47,229 --> 00:03:49,060
much later in the game and you also

105
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,799
don't get fast travel until about four

106
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,209
or five hours into the game so be

107
00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:53,889
prepared to deal with that boss design

108
00:03:53,889 --> 00:03:56,530
immortal boasts a good number of bosses

109
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:58,540
however more than half of them are not

110
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,370
even unique in our simply up scaled

111
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:02,019
versions of the same enemies you've been

112
00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:04,389
fighting the entire game the weak points

113
00:04:04,389 --> 00:04:06,519
are the same the visuals are the same

114
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:08,650
their movements are the same they're

115
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,750
carbon copy clones up scaled to look

116
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,449
boss size there are a few unique ones

117
00:04:13,449 --> 00:04:16,000
sure and some are okay but the majority

118
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,010
were disappointing to fight and look at

119
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:19,950
and they honestly got old real quick

120
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:22,419
believe it or not everyone the sound

121
00:04:22,419 --> 00:04:24,100
design in the game is incredibly just

122
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,050
pointing it'll let down as well first

123
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:27,550
thing that comes to mind is how every

124
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:29,110
weapon of the same type and immortal

125
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:31,270
sounds exactly the same you pick up an

126
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,640
m4 Laser assault rifle sounds the exact

127
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,530
same as this weird a kei laser thing you

128
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:37,840
have pick up a laser using sounds the

129
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,760
exact same as your Kriss vector if

130
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,170
you're you're lucky and pick up a unique

131
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:43,120
looking sniper rifle well it's gonna

132
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,770
sound the same as your laser Dragunov

133
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,000
you get the point

134
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,320
they seem to have just picked one

135
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,450
generic sound for each class of weapon

136
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:50,410
and used it throughout the entire

137
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:52,930
playthrough once again failing to

138
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,970
innovate this sort of laziness applies

139
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:56,890
to nearly every other audio aspect of

140
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:58,810
immortal as well it also felt like the

141
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:01,300
same song played 24/7 in the game on a

142
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,250
loop in the background always a

143
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,110
depressing tune that even if it did

144
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,150
change was almost identical across every

145
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:09,400
planet in location however the game's

146
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,930
biggest problems are not with the

147
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,850
visuals or the audio or the sound at all

148
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:15,250
it's in the actual technical aspects of

149
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,620
the gameplay itself first off the enemy

150
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,050
AI is absolutely awful

151
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:21,970
every enemy seems to show almost no

152
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:23,920
signs of intelligence and will quite

153
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,420
literally just stand there while you

154
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,670
shoot them in the face at times most

155
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:29,320
enemies will not be able to shoot or do

156
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,270
anything if you simply corner peek and

157
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,800
it results in a lot of fights being a

158
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,050
complete joke this AI problem more than

159
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:37,210
extends to bosses as well since multiple

160
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:39,130
bosses like I said are reused as

161
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,750
standard enemies and suffer from the

162
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,620
same stupidity

163
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,660
there were times where I literally just

164
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,280
stood outside of their weapon range and

165
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,200
shot them in the head or times where the

166
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,150
boss just forgot I existed and let me

167
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,350
stand there shooting his weak point

168
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,300
resulting in them dying in mere moments

169
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,460
there were times where I watched enemy

170
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,200
AI faceplant against a wall and walk

171
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,450
into it try to commit suicide via ledges

172
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:00,490
and constantly shoot one another they

173
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:01,990
don't even seem to react when they're

174
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:03,820
shot by their friends simply getting up

175
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,710
again to walk slowly in my general

176
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:07,840
direction you can easily summarize most

177
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,490
enemies in the game down to four types

178
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:11,620
and it means that walk slowly at you and

179
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,900
try to melee you and die enemy is that

180
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,120
standing place and fire slowly at you

181
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,370
before dying and it means that standard

182
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:20,410
long range in fire at you before dying

183
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:22,840
and the most annoying bullshit ones the

184
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,120
teleporters the teleporting enemies in

185
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,620
this game are without a doubt the worst

186
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,680
thing to ever exist in a Souls game ever

187
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,470
there to put it simply enemies that

188
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:34,270
teleport around or near you and then

189
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:36,400
shoot you almost instantaneously without

190
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:36,920
any

191
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,290
for you to react this will result in

192
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:41,360
dozens of cheap and frustrating deaths

193
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,580
with the difficulty being more an orangy

194
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,890
than actual skill if you do end up

195
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:47,630
playing this you'll know exactly what

196
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:49,220
I'm talking about when you run into the

197
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,230
telus nieghbors combat in this game is

198
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:53,000
the most average iteration of the

199
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,130
third-person RPG style I have ever

200
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:57,710
encountered melee is incredibly useless

201
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:59,600
from what I found only having you spam

202
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,610
one button to do the same combo over and

203
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:03,770
over again and the guns themselves give

204
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:05,780
no positive feedback and feel janky

205
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,400
throughout the game if you're using a

206
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,080
controller you'll notice more than a few

207
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,550
issues with the smoothness of aiming

208
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:12,560
resulting in you simply using the combat

209
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,870
lock throughout your entire play weapons

210
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,430
are also seemingly bound to the same

211
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:18,200
range of effectiveness resulting in

212
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,150
sniper rifles having relatively the same

213
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:21,920
range as something like a pistol further

214
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,960
removing any individuality that the

215
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,150
weapons could have had I'm not sure why

216
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:27,650
they made the design decision to further

217
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:29,660
remove any unique feel from the guns but

218
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,220
that's what they did and it's not good

219
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,320
magic isn't a thing in this game you've

220
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,390
got a mana bar but it's only ever used

221
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,220
to activate these special abilities on

222
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,900
weapons which for the most part are a

223
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,300
detriment to use or entirely lackluster

224
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,670
these include things like burst fire or

225
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,620
precision shot and none of the weapons

226
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,530
particularly have anything spectacular

227
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:50,330
impressive even the legendary ones since

228
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:51,890
ammo is such an issue for the vast

229
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:53,630
majority of your playthrough the last

230
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:54,890
thing you're going to want to do is

231
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:56,810
empty your entire magazine on a special

232
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,210
ability making most of them worthless as

233
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:00,770
far as one positive will give the game

234
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:02,180
though it's nice to see that there's

235
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,130
sort of a localized damage system in the

236
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:06,110
game shooting enemies in certain spots

237
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,150
will result in staggers or limbs being

238
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:10,430
blown off and I can appreciate that but

239
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,900
most of the time you're just going to

240
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,280
aim for the head shot to kill them

241
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,500
instantly or get tons of critical damage

242
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,120
this was the one small bit of innovation

243
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,950
and difference in the mechanics from the

244
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,720
other Souls games I've played and they

245
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,880
didn't elaborate on it nearly enough so

246
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,470
with all of these problems yet to ask

247
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,420
was the game technically sound at least

248
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:29,450
no no it was not no it was not

249
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:31,550
throughout my playthrough I ran into a

250
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:33,440
myriad of bugs and glitches that caused

251
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,479
me a lot of frustration enemies would

252
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:37,520
constantly teleport into walls and shoot

253
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,380
me through them I got stuck on more

254
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:41,000
objects than I could possibly try to

255
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,250
count and had to teleport home I had

256
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,680
multiple audio glitches I had multiple

257
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,660
texture glitches I had multiple

258
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,130
fullscreen issues

259
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,959
and I fell through the world no less

260
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,060
than three times this was not a

261
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,589
technically sound title by any

262
00:08:54,589 --> 00:08:56,180
definition of the word everything that

263
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:58,310
it does is either incredibly average or

264
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:00,050
below average and the only thing I could

265
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:02,269
possibly say it did better was frustrate

266
00:09:02,269 --> 00:09:04,310
me beyond words due to this immortal

267
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,139
unchained is getting a final score of

268
00:09:06,139 --> 00:09:08,240
four out of ten it was a below average

269
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,649
and buggy game

270
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:11,720
I cannot suggest you buy it at full

271
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,850
retail price maybe when it's down below

272
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:16,550
$20 but not until that point there were

273
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:18,319
so many chances for them to do something

274
00:09:18,319 --> 00:09:19,940
incredible or amazing with the core

275
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,829
concept they were going with but at the

276
00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:23,660
end of the day the entire iteration

277
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:26,630
simply felt mediocre I honestly would

278
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,850
suggest and I can't believe I'm saying

279
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:31,639
this is the surge or lords of the fallen

280
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:34,220
over this game any day if you're looking

281
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,620
for a souls like fix anyway guys that's

282
