1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:04,540
One of the most common questions I am told is, Felix

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:06,640
How do you remain so humble?

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,020
And I gotta say

4
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:11,080
Being the most successful Youtuber of all time

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,860
Having the most views of all time

6
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,440
Being this attractive (sure pewds), being this charismatic

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,529
being this all-around wonderful being that everyone just loves,

8
00:00:20,529 --> 00:00:26,440
it's not easy to remain this humble BUT WHAT I DO is I look at other humble people

9
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,080
And I appreciate their humbleness

10
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,160
And that inspires me to become even more humble.

11
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,750
I'm actually not just humble. I'm way more humble than I think you could even understand.

12
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:41,940
So let's explore some other humble people that we can find inspiration from, together.

13
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:42,440
(?subreddit ?review)

14
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,240
Calming music with beautiful intro title??)

15
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:48,680
The agony of being too beautiful to stay faithful.

16
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,600
ouhh (in pain)

17
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,120
Uh(in pain) .

18
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:54,059
This one hits close to home. I... I am extremely attractive.

19
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:55,660
(laughs)

20
00:00:55,660 --> 00:01:00,760
And It's just a pain.
It's not just a pain, it is an

21
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,440
Agony.

22
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,199
One woman's !!VERY!! brave confession

23
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:06,369
Incredible

24
00:01:06,369 --> 00:01:12,340
Absolutely, this this I feel this one. Alright, let's click on the next video. Oh!

25
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,720
Oops..

26
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,479
How is- what is this doing here?

27
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:22,380
Oh that times magazine hundred most influential people Felix Kjellberg article written by none other than Trey Parker himself

28
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,780
I can't believe THIS...

29
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,080
just popped up there.

30
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,660
Don't wanna brag but my neckbeard is looking

31
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,880
Ok today

32
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,460
huuuh...

33
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,660
This is so typical of so many youtubers

34
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:42,640
Their ego has just blown out of proportion that they don't realize when they're not being humble

35
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:49,500
Absolutely, disgusting behavior from jacksFilms. And I expect nothing less from him to be honest. I get it!

36
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,400
I'm not a celebrity

37
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:55,780
I just have over two billion views online and get approached by people

38
00:01:55,780 --> 00:02:01,580
every time I go out in public. Yeah, that's right. Stop calling me a celebrity

39
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:07,150
I can't barely leave the door without the swarm of paparazzi and fans meeting me left and right

40
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,119
Please step aside

41
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:09,950
I am just a mere

42
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:12,680
human trying to walk along you

43
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:16,780
Stop calling me a celebrity because I am NOT. Never changed on easy on.

44
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,800
The new pope is a humble man

45
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:27,060
Very much like me which is- which probably explains why I like him so much.

46
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:31,310
I understand this one humble beings get attracted to other humble character

47
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:37,700
That's this simple science fact, if you're not humble, then you probably can't understand this

48
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:42,190
- You're not known to be a humble man, but I wonder... 
- I think I am actually humble

49
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:47,320
I think I'm much more humble than you would understand

50
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,640
???

51
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,080
I love this clip. He's so awesome

52
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,640
That's an example of a humble man. No one likes someone that brags constantly

53
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,480
Son: Oooh! NO WAY. NO WAY!

54
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,900
MOM

55
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,180
MOM!

56
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:05,960
MOM!

57
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,460
Mom: Yeah?

58
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:09,000
Son: I'm a 443 subscribers!

59
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,100
Mom: WHO GIVES A SHIT?

60
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:10,600
Son: Ow

61
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,280
???

62
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,500
Ow

63
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,380
ooOwWWw

64
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:15,240
??????

65
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:20,700
See no one likes you ki- little kid. No one cares about how many subscribers you have

66
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:26,040
Stop bragging about your 450 subscribers. Did I mention that I have 62 million, by the way?

67
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,800
Oh, what is this?

68
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:34,040
The most handsome faces of 2017. Oh, I forgot this tab open. Oh, sorry guys, I was

69
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,320
Doing some research on humble people and this

70
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,200
showed up.

71
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,180
Not my intention.

72
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:46,540
I'm on a walk and cis guys keep checking me out.

73
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,420
UUUUUGH

74
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:53,860
All these boys just keep looking at me AAAHHH

75
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:58,760
Just don't you just hate when that happens, especially cis guys?

76
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,160
Absolute worst

77
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,320
Is it just me or does this paid off

78
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:07,680
2016 Ranger Rover make my new haircut look good?

79
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,880
A very nice combination of being humble about your haircut and your new vehicle at once. Very inspiring self

80
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:18,300
Oh, it keeps going. I've been doing this thing lately where I tip people

81
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:22,820
obscenely and give money to all the homeless people I see.

82
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,940
Literal saint here guys. What a humble character.

83
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:30,020
Love is when your seven-year-old knocks your

84
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,620
Woman of the Year Award off the shelf.

85
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:35,060
Did I mention that I was Woman of the Year...

86
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,320
Award, by the way?

87
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:42,820
Smashes it and you scoop him up and tell him it's fine because the work you did to get that award

88
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:48,700
is still out there in the world, and I don't need a big bronze eagle with my name on it

89
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,180
People already know

90
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,700
Especially thanks to tweets like this one

91
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,240
When I have a drawer

92
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,820
full of letters from readers whose lives have changed instead

93
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:02,140
he's more distraught than I am, poor sausage

94
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:05,280
I'm so glad they gave woman of the year to such a humble character

95
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,400
That doesn't like to brag... or at least humble brag.

96
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,880
A homeless woman asked me to buy her water

97
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:16,220
So I did. Two of the best brands

98
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,100
WOW

99
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,700
???

100
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:23,720
Literal saint! The best brands of water for a homeless person

101
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:29,380
Don't you think you that's a little too far? Don't you think that's spending money a bit too carelessly?

102
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,400
When I exited !WHOLE FOODS!

103
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,640
DiD I mENtiOnEd I sHOp fOod At Whole Foods?

104
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,800
I asked her to choose which bottle

105
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,660
Which- which bottle of water do you wha-ha-ha?

106
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:43,460
I did this action to remind MYSELF

107
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:49,220
That no matter what situation we are in we always have a choice

108
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:52,340
? ? ? Humbleness is a beautiful thing ? ? ?

109
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,460
Incredible

110
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,220
? ? ?

111
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,100
Now that's was this is all about.

112
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:01,380
The second thing I wanted to address in this video is the comments of me being a rich kid

113
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:05,540
I'm gonna go ahead and address you guys right now. That is not the case !SHUTUP!

114
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,980
That is not the case with this channel

115
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:10,819
You know, you guys might be on the wrong channel if you think then that I'm a rich kid of some sort

116
00:06:10,819 --> 00:06:16,500
I'm just trying to address that guys. I just had worked very hard for what I've got on my channel and I take that

117
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,020
with pride and joy, and the last thing is

118
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:25,260
*curb your richkid*

119
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:31,320
Extremely humble characters. I just love how YouTube especially just breeds humble character

120
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:37,260
It's- it's a community just filled with people that don't wanna show off too much

121
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:43,220
It's not like it just rewards the whole channel by putting money in the title. Which creates a- eeh-

122
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:47,000
wonderful ecosystem of just humble characters such as me

123
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:54,300
I am so happy I gave up a scholarship to get my masters to become a youtuber

124
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,620
ha hah ah???

125
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:57,580
Is this me?

126
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,160
???

127
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,340
Yeah, I don't know if you guys knew this but I used to study Industrial Academy and Management

128
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,940
It was required

129
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:12,060
It would have given me a high-paid job and I didn't- I'm so glad I decided to go with what I love.

130
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,980
I never felt more ALIIIIVE

131
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:17,640
I'M SO HAMBLEEEEE!!!!

132
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:24,080
It's not every day that you have a dragonfly land on your finger when you're washing your car

133
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:29,400
You must know I donate a lot of money to these environmental groups

134
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,200
By the way, did I tell you ARJYGUYFJHINRDC?

135
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:38,179
A classic example of how to be humble. This completely unrelated thing happened

136
00:07:38,179 --> 00:07:44,749
So this gives me a chance to be humble about what I am so great. I see a reoccurring pattern here

137
00:07:44,749 --> 00:07:45,560
??

138
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,880
Sure, they catcall me

139
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:53,780
Sure, they tell me I'm pretty. Sure my outfits are great

140
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:57,900
Sure, they tell me that my art can save the world

141
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:01,260
But does any of it mean anything?

142
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:08,320
Do they see the struggles and victories of an artist, a thinker, behind closed doors?

143
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:12,660
IS ANYONE SERIOUS anymore?

144
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:17,920
I think the same thing all the time. Yes, I have an extremely attractive

145
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,780
persona and face

146
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:26,140
But is anyone really serious? I have also extremely amount of intellects

147
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:32,200
collected in here. Does anyone even see that?

148
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,040
*applause*
 ? ? ? ? ? ?

149
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:43,500
Number one rule of being humble is that giving to the homeless. Only counts if you're filming it. Otherwise

150
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,720
Who's gonna know about it?

151
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,900
Even with 140 IQ

152
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:53,260
Did I mention that my IQ is 140?

153
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,460
I still can't install a printer

154
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:58,240
Even with 105 m...

155
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,080
thousand IQ

156
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,100
I'm still just a dummy like you guys

157
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:07,200
