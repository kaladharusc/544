2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,700
great news guys so it's just been

3
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,590
recently announced that Henry Cavill

4
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:18,790
will be playing Geralt of Rivia for

5
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:22,539
Witcher the Netflix series that's coming

6
00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:25,630
out and I'm so excited because you know

7
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:29,230
our boy Supes it's getting more acting

8
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:32,320
roles dude Henry Cavill is a fantastic

9
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,170
choice he's a great actor if you haven't

10
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:37,239
seen Mission Impossible the latest one I

11
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:38,920
think fall out you need to definitely

12
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,370
need to go out and see it now does Henry

13
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:44,350
have the look of Gerald now I don't

14
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:47,199
immediately think of Henry when I think

15
00:00:47,199 --> 00:00:51,519
of Geralt there of course you know one

16
00:00:51,519 --> 00:00:54,550
of my favorite cosplayers is spot-on for

17
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:57,609
garel but you know what it you need

18
00:00:57,609 --> 00:01:00,219
somebody of henry's high caliber to

19
00:01:00,219 --> 00:01:03,850
bring butts in the seats or butts in the

20
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:07,240
couches for Netflix new series in fact

21
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,040
it's pretty crazy that he gets the role

22
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,640
because I mean he's shown pretty strong

23
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,950
interest for it and this is before all

24
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:18,100
this he is a huge fan of video games and

25
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,329
that's why we should all love Henry

26
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:21,310
because you know he plays sky room he

27
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:23,409
plays World of Warcraft of course plays

28
00:01:23,409 --> 00:01:26,170
The Witcher so it was and I think we

29
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:28,719
almost have i GN to thank a little bit

30
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:30,250
for this they said hey would you like to

31
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,619
play you know Geralt and he said this

32
00:01:32,619 --> 00:01:33,850
The Witcher 3

33
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:36,880
I just replayed all the way through love

34
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,189
that game really became Yugi fancy

35
00:01:39,189 --> 00:01:40,659
playing Geralt because Netflix are

36
00:01:40,659 --> 00:01:43,030
making a which TV show absolutely yeah

37
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:45,039
that would be be an amazing I read the

38
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:46,840
books now I having the Polish books the

39
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,930
books are amazing the books are really

40
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:51,969
really good so I think probably after

41
00:01:51,969 --> 00:01:53,859
that interview or maybe the talks were

42
00:01:53,859 --> 00:01:55,600
already happening but after that

43
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,549
interview boom everything got

44
00:01:57,549 --> 00:02:00,280
accelerated and he is now Geralt of

45
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,679
Rivia which i think is really really

46
00:02:02,679 --> 00:02:05,469
freaking cool previous rumors had I

47
00:02:05,469 --> 00:02:08,110
think Sebastian Stan which was the

48
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:10,270
Winter Soldier if you guys remember him

49
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:13,330
from the Marvel movies though you know I

50
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:15,250
think that he could still be in the

51
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,750
series he would be

52
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,750
absolutely perfect for dandelion I would

53
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,760
love to see him play that role but yeah

54
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,590
so I mean the series probably isn't

55
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:26,380
coming out for a while probably 2019

56
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:30,220
maybe even early 2020 but it's good to

57
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:33,760
see some of this come together and I'm

58
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,010
really really hopeful now I hope this

59
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:37,690
doesn't take away from his Superman

60
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,880
duties because according to Henry Cavill

61
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,730
his contract I think he's got one hour 2

62
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,680
appearances left as Superman I think

63
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,870
only one which I really hope they get

64
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:50,050
those contract negotiations going and

65
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:53,739
finalized because yeah the DC EU was a

66
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:56,770
disaster but some of the good things was

67
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:59,050
Wonder Woman which who I was wrong about

68
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,360
and Henry Cavill who I was right about

69
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,970
so I hope that at least those to stick

70
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:05,910
around and that this doesn't you know

71
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:09,070
interrupt any of that which could

72
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:10,720
conflict with schedules if he's trying

73
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,330
to do Man of Steel too but I think it's

74
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:17,440
fantastic news because you know besides

75
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,660
Superman one of my favorite things of

76
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,670
all time is Gerald so it's really cool

77
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:24,160
seeing Henry Cavill able to play this

78
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,870
and there's been some fan pictures I

79
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:27,549
haven't really found really good ones

80
00:03:27,549 --> 00:03:30,700
yet of what he might look like as Geralt

81
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:35,019
here's a few here but in some of the you

82
00:03:35,019 --> 00:03:36,790
know series this has been in before he

83
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:39,459
kind of has a little bit of that look

84
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:41,890
now is he gonna be able to pull off the

85
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:45,090
classic English girl voice that

86
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:49,329
sarcastic sassiness hell no you smell

87
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:53,110
wonderful Geralt we're at a Funeral you

88
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:57,310
smell wonderful at this funeral no not

89
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:00,060
another portal

90
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,820
oh all god help a poor wretch in need

91
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,530
pretty please

92
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:06,510
grasp it firmly you move it around and

93
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:10,790
the louder it squeals the closer you are

94
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:15,300
spare me your juvenile wit please nobody

95
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,430
can pull that off but dogged English

96
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:19,530
voice actor for Geralt so that's gonna

97
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:22,019
be kind of a big concern what would you

98
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:29,850
like me to say if I were to choose

99
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:31,890
between one evil and another I'd rather

100
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:35,070
not choose at all to me that is Geralt

101
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:38,400
that that is 100% girl and so it's gonna

102
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,250
be kind of difficult I wonder if you

103
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,680
know Henry is gonna try to mimic Doug in

104
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,050
certain ways with his voice or if he's

105
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,880
gonna add something completely new now

106
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,740
many of you may not know this but this

107
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:52,320
is the first live-action Witcher series

108
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,680
or which are content they're they there

109
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,350
have been attempts before unfortunately

110
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:07,380
they have not been very good mr. pink

111
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:13,930
[Music]

112
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,920
yeah

113
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,500
so hopefully Netflix is putting enough

114
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,510
money behind this and honestly Netflix

115
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:23,990
has been on fire recently and I really

116
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,520
like some of the the content they've

117
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,720
been putting out especially in the

118
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,600
animation Department Voltron legendary

119
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,920
defenders you guys need to go out and

120
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,470
see disenchantment pretty rough start to

121
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,000
the season but a lot of potential for

122
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,990
season 2

123
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:39,890
so Netflix is getting more and more

124
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:42,230
reasons to to purchase it so definitely

125
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:44,420
I'm gonna be following all the news

126
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:47,360
about The Witcher series and eventually

127
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,970
doing a trailer reaction when we get a

128
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:52,160
trailer and a review in the series comes

129
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,990

130
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:57,710

00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:59,780
