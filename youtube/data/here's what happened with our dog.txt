his creative director something like that Roy works with juicy couture so

73
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,789

74
00:06:01,789 --> 00:06:05,090
he's like I need a cute baby can i borrow yours that's how it happened

there wasn't like an audition process or headshot that we didn't get paid

76

I was conflicted because i really like you but then like the pragmatic partners

81
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,689

97
00:07:31,999 --> 00:07:40,449
I was checking out your light of skateboard wheels oh yeah that's right

98
00:07:40,449 --> 00:07:50,589
this pile of fake dog poop reminded me that there's something I mean to talk

99
00:07:50,589 --> 00:07:52,479
about here on the blog

100
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:56,469
our dog GG real talk i'm just a minute

101
00:07:56,469 --> 00:08:02,979
real time I've been hesitant to bring this up and a lot of people to judges

102
00:08:02,979 --> 00:08:07,120
for this and also it's like anytime I talk about it can do it starts crying so

103
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:14,050
I we had to give away our poodle GT GTS 14 years old and canvases her since she

104
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:16,419
was a baby she had been in my life for 10 years

105
00:08:16,419 --> 00:08:22,990
she's a great dog amazing dog but she's been weird since the baby was born and I

106
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:25,330
love dogs more than anyone on planet Earth

107
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:28,659
but if the choice is a baby safety or the dog you always have to choose the

108
00:08:28,659 --> 00:08:32,740
baby's safety like in the last couple months you got really bad for the

109
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:36,849
episode with the whole day in the hospital with can discuss yet a cut on

110
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:37,599
her finger

111
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:42,940
GG bit Candice and put her in the hospital it's Francine was there and we

112
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:48,730
tried like this really cute little like humane puppy friendly on muzzle

113
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:52,149
that wasn't a muscle but you could drink water and just got cute pink ribbon that

114
00:08:52,149 --> 00:08:56,680
went around her snout and she was miserable she hated it so long story

115
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:01,240
long canvases best friend crystal adopted GG from us

116
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,959
GG moved in with her in her apartment on tenth Street which is about 12 blocks

117
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:09,160
that way we go in visitor soon as she comes and visits us we still see her

118
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:12,940
she's very happy they're trying to be responsible parents and responsible dog

119
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:17,380
owners and it's been a very difficult ordeal for both Candice and me

120
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:25,890
yeah

121
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:30,480
the sad thing with the food of the whole situation was sad

122
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,530
I can't end the episode and such at no time to find something funny and

123
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:43,480
this will be the thumbnail ready

124
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:46,990
but its fake its fake boot this plastic
