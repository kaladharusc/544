75
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:40,720
I can sew the lace engine that's in here

76
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,630
sits in the bottom right about this area

77
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:46,000
what does a lace engine mean lace engine

78
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,910
pulls the laces tongue we charge it you

79
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:51,460
there's a little jack right there plug

80
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:54,250
it in both shoes it's a Y cable that

81
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,840
looks into the wall what did you just

82
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,919
turn the lights on yeah

83
00:04:56,919 --> 00:05:00,070
oh my god can I try these on absolutely

84
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:11,409

yellow yeah Wow

88
00:05:47,769 --> 00:05:50,019
is it a generic tightness or does it

89
00:05:50,019 --> 00:05:52,119
tighten it's different for everybody so

90
00:05:52,119 --> 00:05:53,739
there's a tension that's in there and

91
00:05:53,739 --> 00:05:55,569
it's waiting to see the tension so like

92
00:05:55,569 --> 00:05:57,939
if your foot volume is larger it'll

93
00:05:57,939 --> 00:06:00,129
it'll tighten less the color scheme is

94
00:06:00,129 --> 00:06:02,349
did you just work off images were you

95
00:06:02,349 --> 00:06:03,999

the yellow button lights hold on ready

100
00:06:16,289 --> 00:06:19,599
lights to get them to tighten you just

101
