1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:11,160
reading lots of Korean also I get you're

2
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,870
trying to tell a year mm audience how

3
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:14,280
big comic books are and everything but

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,660
is there any reason why you needed to

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:16,980
tell us the number of pages and

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,810
illustrations also I need a source on

7
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,340
all these statistics can someone call

8
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,810
that Wikipedia guy to put a citation

9
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,820
needed on this movie what happens in the

10
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,340
delivery did you drop them this doctor

11
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:27,539
apparently went to the school of making

12
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:28,949
things super dramatic instead of just

13
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:30,390
telling everyone what the problem is

14
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:31,679
they can't even fit the name of the

15
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,090
school under the sign it's so long and

16
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:34,950
drawn-out his arms and his legs are

17
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:36,809
broken really then what the book was

18
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:38,070
this earlier with the baby moving his

19
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:39,780
arms back and forth also a medical

20
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,280
diagnosis delivered as a sermon

21
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,480
hello everyone my name is n night

22
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,070
Shyamalan I am extremely clever with my

23
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,020
camera and won't someone notice me why

24
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,760
are we talking about me I'm afraid of

25
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,620
water David Dunn is the same weakness as

26
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,390
the aliens and signs why did this girl

27
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:52,890
choose to sit next to David when the two

28
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:53,969
seats in front of them seemed to be

29
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:55,890
wholly unoccupied how long you gonna be

30
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,070
in Philadelphia I'm married not for long

31
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:00,719
immediately after being rejected idiot

32
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,340
separated husband goes right back to

33
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:03,780
wearing the ring dude either the

34
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,430
marriage is salvageable or it isn't this

35
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:06,659
girl on the train should have no bearing

36
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:08,670
on the matter not this train cars seats

37
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,619
facing backwards how is this girl facing

38
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:12,060
the extra marital embarrassment that is

39
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:12,960
Bruce Willis right now

40
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,159
what's with the upside-down kids in this

41
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,450
movie this shot of David in the

42
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,500
background while the body in the

43
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,909
foreground gets bloodier by the second

44
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:19,680
this is some masterful shot between the

45
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,000
six-tenths in this movie I'm actually

46
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,650
not surprised at night keeps getting

47
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,540
work despite his failures this here is

48
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:25,530
some brilliant stuff man

49
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:26,729
a minutes worth of silent reflection

50
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:28,860
bullsh sure it's an unbroken shot the

51
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,360
shot is unbreakable but it's not like

52
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,310
fawn or anything awkward separated but

53
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,659
still in love with wife you didn't die

54
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:35,189
hug hey Dad you should love mom again

55
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:36,720
okay please did they leave it up to

56
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,159
David the lock up the church after the

57
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,630
memorial service where did everybody go

58
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:43,170
$40 um four-door sedan see I can play

59
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,909
this game too I checked you were right

60
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:47,430
you're never taking a sick day five

61
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,740
years no sick day I get it okay even if

62
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,180
David Dunn were somehow clueless to his

63
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,950
own and vulnerabilities there's no way

64
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,750
he'd work a job for five years and not

65
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,189
remember he hadn't taken a sick day to

66
00:01:56,189 --> 00:01:57,630
the point where he needs to ask me a

67
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:59,399
note left with a secretary do you

68
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:01,350
remember me getting sick he can't even

69
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,000
remember ever getting sick in his life I

70
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,829
mean by 15 he'd be bragging to the other

71
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:06,509
kids about how he never gets sick by 25

72
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:07,770
he'd be like Bill Murray and Groundhog

73
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,119
Day doing everything he can to try to

74
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,069
get sick and by 35 he'd be selling his

75
00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:13,170
blood to the CDC via the CIA

76
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,760
would not happen is this guy not getting

77
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,650
sick his entire life and not be noticing

78
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:19,440
it where is it on a bench across the

79
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,780
street yep I your mother left a present

80
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,830
for you you want a bench across the

81
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:25,410
street in 1974 West Philadelphia and I

82
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:26,670
still expect it to be there when you're

83
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,080
paranoid ass finds his way through the

84
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,340
fear and across the parking lot

85
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,570
Wow even wrapped in purple paper

86
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,370
screaming I am a present please open me

87
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:34,200
this gift somehow remain untouched until

88
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,760
a little mr. glass got here things are

89
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,290
constantly upside-down and symbolic and

90
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,000
in this movie but this camera move keeps

91
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,500
our view of the comic book upside down

92
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,270
for a bit until it decides now let's

93
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,350
look at this right-side up for once

94
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:44,580
making me wonder what the point of that

95
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,770
was other than they look cool they say

96
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:49,290
this one has a surprise ending thanks M

97
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:50,670
night for telegraphing the surprise

98
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,280
ending my kid's gonna go berserk once a

99
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,500
game please if Elijah has such standards

100
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,880
for the works of art in this place why

101
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,870
didn't he try to figure out this guy's

102
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,610
intentions in the first place you need

103
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:02,550
to go now I'm wondering how Elijah stays

104
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,080
in business he caters to people with

105
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,700
extremely specific tastes already and

106
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,230
now he's kicking this guy out for

107
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,580
wanting to give that drawing to his kid

108
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,290
I mean does he stay in business if he

109
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,970
sells just one of these the written this

110
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:13,500
place has got to be high his mom must

111
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,459
have bought him a few of those comic

112
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:15,480
books that currently sold for a hundred

113
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,100
and forty thousand dollars he must not

114
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,540
have to worry about money did you see a

115
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,950
little asian child with a blank

116
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,360
expression sitting outside in a

117
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,890
mechanical helicopter the shakes when

118
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:23,880
you put quarters in it

119
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,130
that's super racist we're by appointment

120
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:28,140
only Elijah who stuck his greeting card

121
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,850
on David's car and is hoping this guy

122
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:31,590
shows up isn't the least bit curious as

123
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:33,090
to who walked into his store I believe

124
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:35,730
comics our last link to an ancient way

125
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:37,739
of passing on history I know he's

126
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:39,000
supposed to be crazy and everything but

127
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,680
what exactly two comic books do to pass

128
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,600
on history exactly hieroglyphs actually

129
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,100
tell a history comic books tell the

130
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,959
story of mutant powers in most cases and

131
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,340
then get adapted into bullshit like

132
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,049
Suicide Squad if there is someone like

133
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:51,870
me in the world and I'm at one end of

134
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:54,000
the spectrum couldn't that be someone

135
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,670
else opposite of me at the other end

136
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:57,630
okay sure

137
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,640
Elijah's a crazy dude but I really don't

138
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,989
know what he expects someone to do once

139
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:02,549
he finds that unbreakable person hey

140
00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:04,290
your bones break and mine don't let's be

141
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:05,940
friends it's time for me to focus during

142
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,320
the scene because I keep hearing James

143
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,700
Spader in my head deciphering these

144
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,230
glyphs behind samuel l.jackson here

145
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:11,000
just

146
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,260
don't take another sip of that water

147
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,780
well if it was poisoned game over I

148
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,489
guess I mean what are we protecting him

149
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:17,690
a problem at this point looking at this

150
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,190
newspaper I wonder why David isn't a

151
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,930
much bigger celebrity than he is surely

152
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:22,400
he'd be getting hit up for interviews

153
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,990
his face would be well known to everyone

154
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,400
and he'd be getting people bothering him

155
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,900
everywhere he goes but this guy still

156
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,900
lives and relative B's after this David

157
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,310
here's an only so that he can't complete

158
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,750
his flashback until later in the movie

159
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,240
when the audience needs a whammy reveal

160
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,160
he's kind of stuff out of line too bad

161
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,510
David can't be at all the entrances

162
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:40,340
during the time leading to kickoff is

163
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,960
this the only guy bringing a weapon into

164
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,850
the stadium today if so what a lucky

165
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,290
break there was this movie saying

166
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:46,580
there's only one entrance to the stadium

167
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,110
and if so where are all these people

168
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,850
walking around the line going and then

169
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:51,290
the guy leaves and David doesn't follow

170
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:52,940
him or anything maybe there really is

171
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,860
only one entrance to this place remember

172
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,540
how David told this guy in person to

173
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,010
start patting people down he didn't get

174
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:59,960
on the radio to do that so any number of

175
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,340
entrances where they aren't padding down

176
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:03,230
this guy can get in how'd you know that

177
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:04,700
guy you bumper was carrying a weapon

178
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,620
more to the point how lucky were you to

179
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,000
bump into that guy who had a weapon the

180
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,530
most unbelievable thing about this movie

181
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:10,730
is that Sam Jackson's character

182
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:12,200
magically spots the camouflage jacket

183
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,880
guy from earlier after a long time

184
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,200
between the ticket line and Elijah

185
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,419
leaving hold up a second do not shout

186
00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:18,680
this is people you want to check for

187
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,530
handguns bad idea also then you spot him

188
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,030
outside the stadium in the parking lot

189
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,560
and now you're chasing him inside the

190
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,730
stadium the fuck is going on with

191
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:27,590
geography in the scene there's no thing

192
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:29,150
when he sees this after breaking 50

193
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:29,570
bones

194
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:31,610
he's Potter's cousin he's starting

195
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:33,979
cornerback jumping University you the

196
00:05:33,979 --> 00:05:35,180
guy the agent was signing about at the

197
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,410
beginning of the movie before she died

198
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:38,600
in a train crash here right now how much

199
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,340
did you put on that were you asleep when

200
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,720
you put the weights on the father-son

201
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,160
bonding superpower discovering

202
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,690
weightlifting scene is so good have I

203
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:46,190
mentioned how brilliant M nights I was

204
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,650
early on in his career ah I know David

205
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:50,150
is a burgeoning superhero but despite

206
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,590
this the movie has him struggling to

207
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:53,810
lift 270 pounds but then they add more

208
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:55,430
weight and he suddenly blows that out of

209
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,780
the water either he's super strong and

210
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:57,890
this kind of weight doesn't affect him

211
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,810
at all or there is a limit which you

212
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:02,810
shouldn't reach yet just turn on some

213
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:04,940
lights Elijah right well isn't that

214
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:05,990
convenient for the story were telling

215
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,030
she's a physical therapist he's a guy in

216
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:10,070
need of physical therapy and all the gin

217
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,630
joints in all the towns in all the world

218
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:12,770
he walks into hurts

219
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:14,600
what part of David's body was injured

220
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,000
who said my husband's name was David you

221
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,680
see this makes it seem like Elijah is

222
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,870
super creepy and well yeah he kind of is

223
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,340
but it's not like he could control who

224
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,750
he got when he got sent to physical

225
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,080
therapy

226
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:24,830
I mean this

227
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,090
ripped is the villain here if you lied

228
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:27,470
you planned this somehow then he is the

229
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,180
most psychic mother I've ever seen

230
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,980
also dang em night we get it you like

231
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:33,170
the Bible David Joseph Elijah I'm

232
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:34,430
surprised you didn't name Robin Wright's

233
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,140
character Bathsheba I like how this drug

234
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,610
deal is what David decides to go after

235
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:39,470
and not the obviously abused child from

236
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:40,100
a few minutes ago

237
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,510
drugs are worse than child abuse which

238
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,250
means this movie was made by the DEA I

239
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,720
don't admire the restraint em Knight

240
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,250
puts in this movie I haven't seen one of

241
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:49,310
his usual cameo excuse me sir you step

242
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,810
out of line please it feels like the

243
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,460
stadium is the crime center of the world

244
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,930
why not always have pat downs when

245
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:55,610
people are coming in Metal Detectors I

246
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:57,620
mean man this college football team must

247
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,720
be like the 1980s Miami Hurricanes or

248
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,980
something to have so many outlaw fans

249
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,270
movie pulls a gotcha

250
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,130
proving David's visions wrong and making

251
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:05,540
him doubt himself when really is just an

252
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,250
excuse to pad the runtime and extra 20

253
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,570
minutes it appears that this middle

254
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:10,160
school is in session basically so why is

255
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,570
there a college football game going on

256
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:12,770
right now something that usually happens

257
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:14,450
on Saturdays and definitely only at

258
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:17,180
nights during weekdays I office was on

259
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,880
the other side of the building bang

260
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,140
scene about you lady just tell the story

261
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,760
about the drowning already old lady

262
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,710
remembers David thank God then tells him

263
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,030
a story about him almost drowning that

264
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:28,100
he entirely forgot and now he we used

265
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,990
that story to avoid his true calling but

266
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:31,220
I'm still more pissed that he somehow

267
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,870
forgot his own near drowning he's one of

268
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,610
the stupidest heroes ever I think you

269
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:36,560
still fuck because water who asked

270
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,330
questions like this don't you just say

271
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,160
are you scared of the water just what

272
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,060
the hell are you doing

273
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,100
yep that's right Joseph is so desperate

274
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,510
to prove his dad's a superhero he's

275
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,700
going to shoot him shoot him not cut him

276
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,380
with a knife or throw a glass at him or

277
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,940
any other still crazy but still more

278
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,620
sensible than a gun way to test that

279
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,330
theory Jesus Christ Joseph get your

280
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:55,490
together also a good job with gun safety

281
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:57,770
David you think twat and Friends listen

282
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:59,690
to each other they don't and they don't

283
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:02,930
shoot each other do they Audrey and no

284
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:05,450
shooting friends Joseph I can't tell if

285
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:06,380
this is supposed to be a moment of

286
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,600
levity or if it's terrible until then

287
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,610
Nick Deary the early years next to the

288
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:12,260
comics that would inspire him better not

289
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,210
be jacking off to the Japanese comics I

290
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:15,050

dude you can see Elijah from here you

292
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:18,530

293
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:19,790
not jacking off and nowhere near

294
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,100
Japanese comics you racist look man I

295
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,750

297
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,690
coming into your store Elijah is

298
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:28,250
addictive Comics comic store employees

299
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,870
and his own goddamn lick David is a

300
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,520
really tactile minded guy touching

301
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,870
humans gives him visions of what they've

302
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,640
done and touching a train now triggers

303
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,770
his final flashback which was a car

304
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:38,570
accident 25 years ago with

305
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:40,339
makes touching the train to get that

306
00:08:40,339 --> 00:08:46,209
memory a little weird what was I saying

307
00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:48,410
guy remove us in four James Newton

308
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:50,000
Howard score which is awesome

309
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,550
go to where people are um what that

310
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:54,290
could mean anything and it's pretty late

311
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:56,000
at night can you give me a five percent

312
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,649
more helpful suggestion David runs into

313
00:08:57,649 --> 00:08:59,060
the one asshole not wearing black or

314
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,680
gray in this scene and guess what jewel

315
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,959
thief also jewel thief nope not a crime

316
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,360
not going after her fucking date rape no

317
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,339
not stopping that guy in fact everyone

318
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:08,779
wearing something colorful is a criminal

319
00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:10,610
remember that also David still waiting

320
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:11,720
for an even worse offender who

321
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,519
conveniently shows up imagine if all he

322
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,839
found from here on out were parking

323
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:16,430
violators and speeding offenders letting

324
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,720
have to live with having let that rapist

325
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,790
go free can I come in this is an instant

326
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,170
door shutting and locking and calling

327
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:21,680
the police

328
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,000
but this guy is actually practicing what

329
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,470
his parents taught him always be polite

330
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:26,839
I sure and then instead of simply

331
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:28,370
slamming the open door he tries to keep

332
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:30,079
this guy from opening a screen door oh

333
00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:32,360
it's important for this crazy psycho

334
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,860
killer to wear his orange jumpsuit

335
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,420
wherever he goes even when he's trying

336
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,829
to look like an everyday normal resident

337
00:09:36,829 --> 00:09:38,540
of this house he's really moving about

338
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,920
this house carelessly not remotely

339
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,509
stealthy like he should be he's just

340
00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:43,550
walking slowly but he has no idea where

341
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,350
the bad guy is so he should be sneaking

342
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:47,149
slowly right water is his only weakness

343
00:09:47,149 --> 00:09:48,920
yet he still somehow chooses to

344
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,600
superhero at a home that has a pool on a

345
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,399
night it's raining also thank God for

346
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:53,660
the bad guy that David's weakness is

347
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,310
water right otherwise this push off the

348
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:56,420
balcony is just a minor inconvenience

349
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,399
over a minute and 10 seconds of almost

350
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,319
drowning you moving are we supposed to

351
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,519
believe that after the jumpsuit guy

352
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,170
threw david off the balcony these kids

353
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,579
saw it and were able to save him from

354
00:10:04,579 --> 00:10:06,050
drowning and the orange man didn't see

355
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:07,310
any of it and the kids aren't freaking

356
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:08,660
out that they might be seen despite the

357
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:09,740
night that david is shown to be a

358
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,209
superhero whose only weakness is water

359
00:10:11,209 --> 00:10:13,250
and he can lift 350 pounds of weights

360
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,870
and paint cans this guy will give him a

361
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:17,300
good fight I just superhero let's also

362
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,160
our marriage is fine now yay you could

363
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,660
argue David sliding the paper into his

364
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:21,920
son's field of view is his way of

365
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,120
telling Joseph that he was right all

366
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,920
along but I see it a simple bragging

367
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,819
which is selfish

368
00:10:25,819 --> 00:10:28,310
Jesus this is good Sean great Sean what

369
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:30,110
happened to this guy I mean he does some

370
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:31,069
things in this movie that are kind of

371
00:10:31,069 --> 00:10:32,300
cheesy and calls attention to himself

372
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,920
but he always gave the story the

373
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,360
characters and the emotional weight a

374
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,920
lot of regard as well I'm removing three

375
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,269
sins for this movie on the whole which

376
00:10:38,269 --> 00:10:39,680
is great and can we get a dam

377
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,670
unbreakable too already

378
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:43,250
we got two ghost writers here comes the

379
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,600
Whammy ending a pretty good whammy

380
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,040
ending actually but it's kind of hard to

381
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,420
believe David never touched the sky

382
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,860
during all their interactions and got a

383
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,939
sense that Elijah was evil

384
00:10:50,939 --> 00:10:53,379
it's never explained how Elijah planted

385
00:10:53,379 --> 00:10:54,850
a bomb on a plane but I guess nobody

386
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:56,499
notices guys in all blue suits walking

387
00:10:56,499 --> 00:10:58,959
with a cane in restricted areas like if

388
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,459
there ever was a fire on floors 1 2 or 3

389
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:04,930
everyone in that hotel will be burned

390
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,269
alive who casually talks about a hotel's

391
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:09,369
fire safety at a bar who brings up that

392
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:10,629
the hotel has secrets and the first

393
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:12,309
thing he says is a fire on the first

394
00:11:12,309 --> 00:11:13,779
three floors would kill everyone welcome

395
00:11:13,779 --> 00:11:15,309
to one of the most anticlimactic endings

396
00:11:15,309 --> 00:11:16,600
especially after dropping a whammy on

397
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,100
you that you'll ever see the movie just

398
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,420
sits here and tells us what happened

399
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,619
rather than showing us even though this

400
00:11:20,619 --> 00:11:22,209
movie is only an hour and 45 minutes

401
00:11:22,209 --> 00:11:23,800
long this ending is almost as terrible

402
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,970
as the entire rest of the movie is

403
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:32,889
amazing 5 sins for this bull welcome to

404
00:11:32,889 --> 00:11:44,959
hell BH

405
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:48,680
I love my dead gay son in West

406
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,869
Philadelphia born and raised on the

407
00:11:50,869 --> 00:11:52,490
playground of hammers and most of my

408
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:55,279
days mr. price can we talk about the

409
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,230
note that you left on my car I'm here to

410
00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:05,769
talk to you about the Avenger initiative

411
00:12:05,769 --> 00:12:09,679
Ezekiel 25:17 the path of the righteous

412
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:16,910
man is beset on all sides

413
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:20,250
he's going pro in the draft they say

414
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,690
come on the forty and four point three

415
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:23,910
seconds thought tommy thomasino sucked

416
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,730

417

419
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:36,459
not necessarily

420
00:12:36,459 --> 00:12:38,600
one of the pin man I think he's one of

421
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,010
them

422
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:43,000
the garbage man negative
