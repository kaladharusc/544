this clip is called Oblivion Walkthrough part 3

80
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:45,970
&quot;Ma'am ma'am&quot;

81
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:51,639
&quot;I came in here to find out something about the surgery my doctor wants to do on my heart.&quot;

82
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:55,830
&quot;Well, I know you're upset and you're scared about this angioplasty procedure&quot;

83
00:05:55,830 --> 00:06:00,790
&quot;But we just don't seem to have anything on clogged arteries and balloon surgeries. I'm sorry&quot;

84
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:04,740
&quot;You know, I may not make it through next week.&quot;

85
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:09,260
And also I have breast cancer. What is this? The Room?

86
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:12,040
&quot;Oh, that jerk Harold&quot;

87
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:15,250
&quot;He wants me to give him a share of my house&quot;

88
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:22,660
&quot;That house belongs to me. He has no right. I am not giving him a penny. Who does he think he is?&quot;

89
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:27,250
&quot;He's your brother.&quot; &quot;He is always bugging me about my house.&quot;

90
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:35,560
&quot;15 years ago, we agreed that house belongs to me. Now the value of the house is going up and he's seen dollar signs.&quot;

91
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,750
&quot;Everything goes wrong at once.&quot;

92
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:43,419
&quot;Nobody wants to help me and I'm dying.&quot; &quot;You're not dying, mom.&quot;

93
00:06:43,419 --> 00:06:46,180
&quot;I got the results of the tests back.

94
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,260
I definitely have breast cancer.&quot;

95
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:52,560
&quot;and I guarantee you as a mother of two boys that I would do everything

96
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:59,580
Illegal, legal. It doesn't matter what it is to get my children into this country.&quot; &quot;Is there a problem with that?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot;

97
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:07,020
&quot;Yes, you would let somebody rape your child.&quot; Oh (woah there)

98
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:10,200
AHHHHh

104
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:56,980
&quot;Do you sometimes wish that April was a turtle?&quot;

105
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:00,460
&quot;Did you want to say something?&quot; Eww, look at the child on the left.
