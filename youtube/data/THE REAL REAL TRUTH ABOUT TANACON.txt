00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:05,240
Good evening. I'm Poppy Harlow and you're watching Pew News.

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,640
[Brace yourself for the lazer]

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:17,040
[ pop of destiny ]

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:17,060
The first news TANACON, you're sick of hearing about it. I'm sick of talking about it(not really)

5
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:22,050
The first news: TANACON. You're sick of hearing about it. I'm sick of talking about it (not really)

6
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,529
So let's just jump IN TO IT. Trust me,

7
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:29,760
there's some pretty spicy news in here that you need to know about.

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,710
For those who don't know Tana Mongeau, the youtuber made a meet up

9
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:37,840
convention at the very same time as VidCon at the very same location as VidCon and,

10
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,079
me ignoring all the lies that were involved,

11
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:47,520
it was, to summarize it, a disaster. Thousands of young fans were waiting outside in the sun with no food, no water, no cover

12
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:53,860
for hours until eventually the event got entirely canceled,

13
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:58,140
disappointing fans that thought they were gonna meet their favorite creators, you know

14
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:04,240
probably parents and themself obviously; spending a lot of money on travel, hotel and

15
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:10,720
the ticket themself (itself), which were just rendered useless. The first blame that we were told was that

16
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,020
15,000 people (Tana- 15,000 people)

17
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:20,140
Just magically showed up unexpectedly, and there's no way for anyone to just

18
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,430
handle that situation

19
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:22,119
and

20
00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:28,600
a lot of people bought it - I even bought it at some point - but later, it came out that that was a lie from a

21
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:35,320
police statement from the City of Garden Grove police department saying that 4,000 tickets were sold and only a thousand

22
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,259
people could actually fit in the event.

23
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:44,439
So then it caused a lot of drama and speculation as to &quot;Did Tana know about this?&quot; &quot;Did Good Times, the event organizer,

24
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:51,250
did they know about this?&quot; and there was a lot of back-and-forth going on and it wasn't really sure what exactly

25
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,110
went wrong, who is

26
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:57,660
responsible of these two parties: Was it Tana? Was it Michael from Good Times?

27
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:05,380
Well now we have the answer [pop] don't you just love a nice conclusion. Thanks to Shane Dawson's latest video. He's a

28
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,409
Close friend with Tana Mongeau,

29
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:15,550
so we get the inside truth, and sorry- not just the truth about Tana Mongeau, but the *REAL* truth about

30
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:16,840
Tana Mongeau...

31
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:24,000
Now the video is 41 minute long and I will [eh] I definitely recommend watching it if you're interested, but I will, however,

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,760
summarize it for you. It's basically 30 minutes of incoherent, ugly sobbing.

33
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:38,820
(incoherent, ugly sobbing)

34
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:45,020
Does anyone know what she's saying? Scientists are still trying to figure this out. I'm Poppy Harlow and rest assure(d),

35
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:50,180
I will do my best. We are working around the clock to decipher this

36
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,020
AND YOU

37
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:51,900
AND YOU BELEEBEE DE BE

38
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:52,860
AND YOU BELEEBEE DE BE GE GIBBON DESIEN

39

AND YOU BELEEBEE DE BE GE GIBBON DESIENVDEAS#VING

40
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,080
[ pop ] In my opinion, Shane did a really good job

41
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,870
at giving the most balanced view on this situation as he possibly could.

42
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:06,430
That being said, they are friends. It's never going to be a balanced

43
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:11,940
presentation, and in my opinion there was a LOT of Tana

44
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:16,940
constantly going after Michael and deflecting blame towards him.

45
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,940
She doesn't have many options to play at this point. [Tana- because I don't know should

46
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:20,769
I have another venue tomorrow?

47
00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:23,010
Should I keep trusting Michael when he keeps *christian channel* me over

48
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:28,230
I don't understand anything, and you still have not answered my last like ten questions to you

49
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:35,139
you just keep diverting the subject] Poppy- because you don't let him speak, Jesus Christ, and I'm sitting there like

50
00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:38,049
It doesn't matter. I can agree

51
00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:43,590
that you- she feels betrayed, that, you know, she thought the event would handle it...

52
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:50,799
It doesn't matter. None of it matters and I'll tell you why, because they both knew.

53
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:51,850
They both

54
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:56,759
Knew, THEY BOTH KNEW, both Tana and Good Times knew

55
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:58,860
[ ??? ]

56
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,680
That the event only held a thousand people,

57
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,000
they both knew that they sold tickets for 5,000,

58
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,420
which isn't surprising!

59
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:12,609
Anytime I work with a company, the first thing they report is &quot;How many things did we sell?&quot;, or &quot;How many

60
00:04:12,609 --> 00:04:13,109
blablabla

61
00:04:13,109 --> 00:04:16,260
did we sell?&quot;, &quot;How many units did we turn?&quot;, &quot;What profit did we make?&quot;

62
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:19,540
It's pretty relevant information, and the fact that they're pretending like

63
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:28,000
They didn't know any of this-

64
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,500
haHAA

65
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:34,840
We could, but are we gonna be more responsible and drop it from 5,000 to 3,000?

66
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:47,400
Which is still three times too many people. They both knew, they also knew that the hotel only held a thousand two hundred

67
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,690
um

68
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:52,480
[ Michael- I have it set to 5,200 right now ]

00:04:54,860 --> 00:05:00,680
yeah... Do you love it now Tana? And the final bit that annoyed me so

71
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,650
much: the final clip that is so

72
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:08,060
annoying to me and I can't- it's

73

[Tana- People love to be oppressed outside] Tana! Hello, in case you're watching,

79
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:40,980
I hope you are, I have a message for you: you say in Shane's video

80
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:45,410
many times that you want to make it right, you might you want to make the situation better,

81
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:48,170
but you don't know how because it's too overwhelming

82
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:51,630
[Tana- I let so many people down and I want to make it right but I-

83
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:55,760
It's crazy. This is not something I ever thought would happen, and I don't know what to do

84
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:03,210
but I have to make it right] You're in luck, because I know how to make this right and I'm not saying that sarcastically or un-

85
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:07,940
ironically, here's what you gotta do. Delete your channel. You clearly don't deserve to have an audience.

86
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,140
The people being oppressed

87
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:16,940
outside was your audience - the people that care for you, the people that paid money to see you. To me,

88
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:24,260
this is a perfect example of Greed of Ego and Greed of Money being combined and creating this giant mess and, ultimately,

89
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:31,920
everyone loses... except me because I get content to criticize.

90
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:37,320
I mean, I had fun :)

91
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:37,920
[ pop ]

92
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:42,780
Next news! Every once in a while, a death occurs in relation to a video game

93
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:50,780
Usually it's in regards of someone playing for 40 hours straight, even playing for days on straight, and lately,

94
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,140
we've been seeing

95
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,420
uuhhh uhh

96
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:58,160
Movement more and more towards the idea that gaming is something harmful,

97
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,169
the White House, for example, exclaiming that

98
00:07:01,169 --> 00:07:07,100
&quot;video games causes school shootings.&quot; World Health Organization classifying gaming disorder as a mental health condition.

99
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:11,680
We talked about this on this channel, but we haven't seen before a

100
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:18,440
psychological death related to video games, at least as far as I'm concerned. Until now [News Anchor- Good morning,

101
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,990
we're gonna start this morning by talking about a free online game

102
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:26,360
after police and a coroner have warned about the risks of it to children.

103
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,140
It's called Doki-Doki

104
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:36,020
Literature Club, and it starts like a dating game set in a high school and features a group of animated girls in a book club.

105
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:39,860
Things do turn sinister with characters self-harming and

106
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:45,460
killing themselves. It's said to be suitable for players aged 13 or over.

107
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:50,810
It was launched last year and was downloaded 2 million times in the first 4 months.

108
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:58,720
An inquest will be held into the death of a 15 year old called Ben Warmsley from Bari whose father said the game

109
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:06,080
dragged his son in] Poppy- So it was reported in the Manchester news that a 15 year old boy was found dead, now his dad and

110
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,740
Coroner have warned about the horror online game he was playing,

111
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:14,590
Doki-Doki Literature Club. This has been covered in a lot of different media:

112
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:19,070
&quot;Don't let your child play Doki-Doki Literature Club before reading this.&quot; It's a bit late

113
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:24,310
now, isn't it? A quote from the father is saying that &quot;Ben was growing up fast. It's hard for parents,

114
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:30,340
but this needs to be highlighted. There is no confirmation yet, but we believe that the game could be linked to Ben's death.&quot;

115
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:35,180
So they're not outright blaming the game for the cause of death. They're just saying that it's a potential cause.

116
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:42,000
That isn't really what gets echoed through the media and Doki-Doki is the front face of this

117
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,700
uh

118
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:49,279
sad event because of it. But what I've noticed while reading through a couple articles is that

119
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:56,350
the description of the game doesn't really fit what the gameplay actually is. You know, I played the game on my channel.

120
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:58,570
It was very popular; people really liked it,

121
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:02,690
it's an amazing game in my opinion, and the constant point that's being

122
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:07,279
reiterated in these article is that &quot;The game will not leave you alone.

123
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:12,440
It will drag you in.&quot; That's- doesn't fit Doki-Doki in my opinion,

124
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:18,480
but, fine. Then it's pointed out in another article that the game is an online game -

125
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,579
which it isn't, I don't know where they got that from - and the father

126
00:09:22,579 --> 00:09:24,380
describing the game as &quot;the character

127
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:28,209
befriends and love you and give you tasks to do but if you do not do them

128
00:09:28,209 --> 00:09:31,339
they turn nasty,&quot; doesn't really fit either, and

129
00:09:31,339 --> 00:09:39,620
then finally, after reading this: &quot;the game was linked with his mobile phone and he would be contacted by text message during day and night,

130
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:44,030
often waking him up.&quot; That's when I realized...

131
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:50,930
They're not talking about Doki-Doki Literature Club. They're talking about another game. It's even shown here in another article.

132
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:52,970
They're talking about

133
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:59,740
Mystic Messenger, a game where you message people, a game that will give you notifications at random points,

134
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:07,790
at least I think, that's what I imagine is what he meant - a game that drags you in, a game that's free - it all fits.

135
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,490
It all fits perfectly.

136
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:16,490
If you go to Doki-Doki's website, the game doesn't lure you in; it's not some sort of con to

137
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:19,730
portray it as this colorful game and it's really a

138
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:26,090
massive plot twist to anyone that it's a horror game. People know you go on the website and it's tagged as a

139
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:32,060
psychological horror, and the first text that shows up is that the game is not suitable for children and those who

140
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,050
(are) easily disturb(ed).

141
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:39,980
But then I thought it was interesting because, in contrast to these other gaming-related death(s), this game is actually very short.

142
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:46,540
It's not focused to drag you in or keep you playing or keep you hooked on the game like many other games are designed to

143
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,520
be these days.

144
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,430
And, after this article came out,

145
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:56,020
another parent came forward and said the same thing - that their child hads- &quot;had problems sleeping, stopped eating,

146
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,060
&quot;there was no clear signs of what would happen.&quot;

147
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:02,240
But, &quot;there were many things happening with my son and Doki-Doki is just one part of it,

148
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,230
but I need the death of my son to have some meaning.&quot; Now

149
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:08,750
I can't possibly imagine what it's like to lose a child and I

150
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:13,010
don't know the hardship of what it's like to being a parent and I'm not

151
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:15,760
blaming any parent...

152
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,520
Sometimes horrible things just happen for no good reason.

153
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:24,520
But in my opinion, one videogame doesn't drive you to do this - at least not Doki-Doki Literature Club -

154
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:29,000
it's just not a reasonable claim, and, I'm gonna put on my Sonic Sez

155
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,040
meme thumbs up here,

156
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:38,810
PewDiePie says, as a parent you should be equally focused on what your child is doing online or in front of the computer as

157
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:41,680
you are focused on what they're doing in their everyday life.

158
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:47,920
I think a lot of parents don't realize that kids are practically growing up in front of their computers and it's a massive part of

159
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,860
their social interaction. To some extent, it needs to be monitored

160
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:57,500
to prevent these sort of things from happening. And the fact that the parent in this instant (instance) described

161
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,000
another game and calling it Doki-Doki Literature Club

162
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:07,630
shows, to some extent at least, that they didn't know what the child was up to, or at least didn't understand it, and I understand

163
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:08,889
that it's confusing as well,

164
00:12:08,889 --> 00:12:14,460
but it- what really amazes me here is how poorly this was covered by the media

165
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:20,300
with almost every single news article all pointing to Doki-Doki, when, clearly,

166
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:25,339
that's not it. What are your thoughts? What are your opinions? I want to hear them.

167
00:12:25,339 --> 00:12:27,680
Let me know in the comments. Kind of a downer.

168
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,380
It's not the most fun- pleasant news to talk about, but I think it's important nonetheless.

169
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:36,840
And finally, I appreciate all the support on Pew News

170
00:12:36,840 --> 00:13:52,000
