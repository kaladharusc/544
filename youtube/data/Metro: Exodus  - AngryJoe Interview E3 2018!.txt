1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,129
hey guys angry Joe here and I'm with the

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:04,380
executive producer for Metro at for a

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:07,859
games and I just got done with the demo

4
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:12,990
and it was really detailed I mean I

5
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:15,299
liked what I saw in the trailer and I

6
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:18,660
saw that same thing in the graphics the

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,480
upgrade there the immersion and we

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,050
played on the train and so that's a new

9
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,570
thing can you tell us a little bit about

10
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,840
that this train mechanic and yeah so I

11
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,430
mean the the Metro series is has spanned

12
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:36,960
three games while two games in the past

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,879
this is the third game now the previous

14
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,800
the two previous games took place kind

15
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,800
of exclusively within the city limits of

16
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,070
Moscow and mostly in the underground you

17
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,559
know inside the Metro tunnels venturing

18
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:52,850
out to the surface very very rarely and

19
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:55,469
Artyom the main character has lived

20
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:58,590
there you know most of his life and he's

21
00:00:58,590 --> 00:00:59,879
been told that there's nothing else out

22
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:01,230
there everything else is just completely

23
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,739
destroyed it's all you know this barren

24
00:01:03,739 --> 00:01:05,880
poison this wasteland there's no point

25
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,350
in going out there nobody nobody's out

26
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:11,189
there everybody's dead yeah but at the

27
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:12,689
beginning of mature Exodus he finds out

28
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:13,560
that's not exactly true

29
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,880
and he gets on this this train with a

30
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,460
group of you know Spartan soldiers it's

31
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,229
the elite military group that he's a

32
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:24,810
member of and they take this train on

33
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:27,810
this epic year-long journey that spans a

34
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:30,810
continent that goes across Russia and so

35
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:33,509
this train is is their home it's it's

36
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:35,579
their base it's it's what carries them

37
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:37,380
along on this journey and when when they

38
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,119
come to a new area and stop and go to

39
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,640
explore it's a place that they can use

40
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,979
is like a base like I'm home like a home

41
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,119
so you guys got

42
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,950
you know you get you learn their names

43
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,399
you get going missions with these guys

44
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:51,780
so there's a lot more ease involved with

45
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,130
them there's a lot more characters this

46
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:55,079
time for the player to interact with and

47
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:56,270
to get to know you know in the past

48
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:58,829
metro games there was maybe one maybe

49
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:01,619
two characters that you would spend a

50
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:03,750
lot of time with over the course of the

51
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,610
story this time there's a lot more yeah

52
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,409
you get a little team vibe to it yeah

53
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:11,569
who wrote the story or so the the

54
00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:13,310
the metro games have always been based

55
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:16,040
on the the book lie by Dmitry Glukhovsky

56
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,030
it wasn't an the Metro 2033 the game was

57
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,590
based on the book directly of the same

58
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:23,810
name Metro last light was a new story

59
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,670
that we created alongside Dimitri

60
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:27,829
because his second book didn't really

61
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:30,159
fit the formula of a video game and also

62
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:32,030
covered different characters and we

63
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,440
wanted to continue the story of Artyom

64
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,230
and with Metro Exodus it's a it's kind

65
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:38,209
of a similar situation it's not based

66
00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:40,549
directly on a book yeah but it carries

67
00:02:40,549 --> 00:02:42,230
on the story from his third book is

68
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:45,409
their hook Metro 2035 kind of sets up

69
00:02:45,409 --> 00:02:47,540
Exodus they kind of they blend together

70
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:50,629
so if you read through Metro 2035 the

71
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:52,310
ending kind of sets up the beginning of

72
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:55,970
Metro axis it so as I was playing I ran

73
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:58,340
into ran into three different issues but

74
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:03,889
everybody else I wasn't able to see what

75
00:03:03,889 --> 00:03:05,690
happened after a certain point but I did

76
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:08,900
see that one thing I really wanted from

77
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,849
the game I already know is in there is

78
00:03:10,849 --> 00:03:13,099
good these interesting creatures that

79
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:15,349
we've got to see before in previous

80
00:03:15,349 --> 00:03:17,030
games you're getting that you're getting

81
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,970
some things in the water some sort of

82
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:22,010
scripted sequences that then turn into

83
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:23,930
actual sequences and gonna play and

84
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:25,639
stuff like that looks really appreciated

85
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:28,250
and then there was the the whole play of

86
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:34,430
the scarcity of the ammo yes you gotta

87
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:36,410
scavenge for resources it was that

88
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:38,389
intentional I think because I thought

89
00:03:38,389 --> 00:03:40,430
that there wasn't gonna be any more

90
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:42,829
limitations on ammo or know that it

91
00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:46,069
wouldn't be any more yes yeah the in

92
00:03:46,069 --> 00:03:48,650
previous metro games we had a ammos

93
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:51,379
currency system that was set up in the

94
00:03:51,379 --> 00:03:53,720
society that was built inside the the

95
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,000
metro system of Moscow and it's it was

96
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,620
these military-grade rounds that

97
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:00,409
functioned as as money or they can be

98
00:04:00,409 --> 00:04:02,299
put into weapons and used for more

99
00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:04,849
damage yeah but that was exclusive to

100
00:04:04,849 --> 00:04:06,560
their society that they had built we're

101
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,849
now we're out in the wilderness there is

102
00:04:07,849 --> 00:04:09,739
no society really there's maybe a couple

103
00:04:09,739 --> 00:04:11,419
groups of people that are living

104
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:13,599
together but there's no like you know

105
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,340
there's nothing really set up outside in

106
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,109
the wilderness the

107
00:04:17,109 --> 00:04:20,289
Tai's everyone together and so it's kind

108
00:04:20,289 --> 00:04:21,879
of it's more like every man for himself

109
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:24,099
and Artem needs to make the things that

110
00:04:24,099 --> 00:04:25,960
he needs right so he needs to scavenge

111
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,719
for resources there's you know metal

112
00:04:28,719 --> 00:04:31,030
metal resources and chemical resources

113
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:32,469
you have to find and you can combine

114
00:04:32,469 --> 00:04:34,840
these things into things like med packs

115
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,409
and gas masks filters ammunition and and

116
00:04:38,409 --> 00:04:40,990
yeah use it so that wherever you want

117
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:42,400
you can just grab the ribbon there you

118
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,689
need some more help packs grab some

119
00:04:43,689 --> 00:04:45,969
stuff crying now I was taking a lot of

120
00:04:45,969 --> 00:04:50,800
damage I ain't no good I control the

121
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,919
boat controls on on hopefully guys well

122
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,020
at least I can't do it well now listen

123
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,310
keyboard is probably gonna be a lot

124
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,860
easier but what was I saying I'm saying

125
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,319
that when when I was getting shot and

126
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:04,539
you know you get the red reticle will

127
00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:06,400
that stay on the whole time cuz they got

128
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,590
some good special sound effects like

129
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:10,539
your heart beating and he starts to

130
00:05:10,539 --> 00:05:12,759
breathe really heavily but if I'm out of

131
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:14,800
you know many packs am I gonna have to

132
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,629
listen to that for the next hour you

133
00:05:16,629 --> 00:05:19,210
know will I find more stuff it's I mean

134
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:21,909
yeah I mean it's a well so it's how we

135
00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:24,219
do the indication that you're you're

136
00:05:24,219 --> 00:05:25,990
damaged I mean you can so it'll be like

137
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:28,000
that there is there is a little bit of

138
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,349
healing over time okay

139
00:05:29,349 --> 00:05:32,259
a tiny bit and and you can you can

140
00:05:32,259 --> 00:05:35,080
actually a little-known thing is the

141
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,520
these rest points where you can go to

142
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,099
sleep to advance time that's between day

143
00:05:39,099 --> 00:05:39,400
and night

144
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,680
you actually will heal when you're gonna

145
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,750
go and sleep so if you have no vet packs

146
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,039
and you can't find resources if you can

147
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,330
find one of those things you can heal up

148
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:48,849
that way too I like how the world opens

149
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,189
up and we went and we explored this sort

150
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:53,110
of church area and it looked like there

151
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:55,389
were survivors there they were friendly

152
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:57,400
and we go there and then it turns out

153
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:01,330
it's crazy crazy cults you know you know

154
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:03,939
talking about no technology yeah yeah

155
00:06:03,939 --> 00:06:07,120
their own religion and and there's some

156
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,319
people there that you might be able to

157
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,210
help and stuff like that is that gonna

158
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:11,710
be and throughout the rest of the game

159
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:14,199
that you find these little things that

160
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:16,479
happen in storylines yeah I mean we so

161
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,509
we don't like to to make like you know

162
00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:21,129
cookie cutter content that's like

163
00:06:21,129 --> 00:06:22,360
stamped around so there's gonna be

164
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,650
different things that are trying to come

165
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,539
across in every area all the areas are

166
00:06:25,539 --> 00:06:27,610
gonna look completely different the

167
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:29,110
environments the the seasons that you

168
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:29,920
come across like

169
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,810
whether everything be completely

170
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:34,240
different in everything yeah we're in a

171
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,800
whole new and we're taking this this

172
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,140
thing is over over the cross okay so all

173
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,730
these things were in this area and then

174
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:43,750
later on you'll move to the area okay

175
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,430
that's cool and that's so the different

176
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:46,300
things that you're gonna be you're gonna

177
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,590
be doing in these different areas in

178
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:48,820
these areas it's gonna be different each

179
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,320
time but yeah you might you might find

180
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,970
some survivors that want to join you one

181
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:53,140
of the things that you have to do in

182
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,690
this level that obviously you can get to

183
00:06:55,690 --> 00:07:00,250
yeah is to obtain a passenger car to add

184
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:03,640
on to the Train so that there's now like

185
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,170
you know like some living space and so

186
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:06,190
that you can take on some more

187
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:08,680
passengers that's cool so there's there

188
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,290
there's different is there gonna be a

189
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:30,700
like a cab or a car that I can add well

190
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,680
I mean like I said the the different

191
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,880
areas are gonna have different societies

192
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,710
and they're going to be you know

193
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:37,960
established at vary to varying degrees

194
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,650
right so you might come across some

195
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:42,670
other societies they're a little bit

196
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,110
more built up and some that that are

197
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,510
that are even less established and then

198
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,980
the one that the one that you came

199
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,870
across so in addition to your backpack

200
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,790
that you're doing is there other areas

201
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:54,370
and you know more what would you say

202
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:56,560
like a heavier craft in or more

203
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,930
elaborate yeah so so the backpack you're

204
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:00,580
able to do certain things on the on the

205
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,010
fly anywhere in the field you can you

206
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:04,840
can customize your weapons the weapons

207
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,990
have been rebuilt the host yeah modular

208
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:09,580
so there's five hard points on every

209
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,690
weapon so you can swap out things like

210
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,110
barrels and stocks and magazines and

211
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:15,580
attachments you know scopes and lasers

212
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:16,870
and things like that and the backpack

213
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,310
allows you to do that anywhere so you

214
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,960
can change your tactics at any moment

215
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,300
you can also craft illuminate supplies

216
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,120
like met packs and and gas mask filters

217
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,600
and some throwable riders but when you

218
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,260
find a

219
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:33,350
a workbench which will be in more of

220
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:35,510
like a little safe house area you're

221
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:36,919
able to do the full suite of crafting so

222
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,720
you can also craft you can craft the

223
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,150
fold the full array of throwable items

224
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,160
you can craft ammunition for your main

225
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:47,020
weapons and you can customize your armor

226
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,430
upgrade your armor and so you know

227
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:50,480
things like your wrist braiser

228
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,870
and that's on the train there there

229
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,310
there is one on the train and there will

230
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:57,500
be work benches throughout the

231
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,300
environment as well okay in addition to

232
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,190
that at the workbench is usually there

233
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:02,570
there in a little safe house and there's

234
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:04,340
gonna be a bed there and the players can

235
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,380
can sleep in that bed and advanced time

236
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:09,530
between night and day which changes as

237
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:11,840
enemies incoming yeah like there's maybe

238
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,870
some more mutants at night or maybe you

239
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,580
can approach situations differently so

240
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,260
that bandit you know hideout you want to

241
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,100
get into because you think there's

242
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,990
something cool in there if you approach

243
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:22,100
it at night maybe some of them are

244
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,630
sleeping and you know you can use cover

245
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,820
of darkness again or you know during the

246
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,640
day some of them might be out on patrol

247
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,590
but you know like maybe maybe there's

248
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:31,820
still some guys in there so you can't

249
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,320
like sneak around as much but there's

250
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,300
less guys right so it kind of allows you

251
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:38,630
to change your tactics and the player is

252
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,070
able to kind of manipulate the world

253
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:42,200
around him in order to approach things

254
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,310
from a different from a different

255
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:45,770
perspective well it sound good sounded

256
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:48,380
good it's looking good is it about how

257
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,020
long is is this one is it be comparable

258
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,240
to the to the last it's much much larger

259
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,040
than than the last one yeah I mean

260
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,960
though in terms of you know different

261
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,730
different angles I can describe this

262
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:02,990
yeah the script is two times it's a

263
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,640
little bit larger than twice the size of

264
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,310
Metro 2033 Metro last light and all the

265
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:10,160
DLC scripts combined combined though so

266
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,720
there's a lot more dialogue and a lot

267
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,960
more story that the player can can you

268
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,460
know immerse themselves in if they want

269
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:16,670
to

270
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,410
there's the critical path and then

271
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,840
there's so much more extra content on

272
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:24,380
this before and did you guys leave voice

273
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,750
acted and players will be able to do the

274
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,630
the Russian voice over track and some

275
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:33,040
titles in their own region if they want

276
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,550
really authentic experience some of

277
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:39,140
those some of the voices are okay on

278
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,480
some other guy I want to see what

279
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,600
stuff still temporary okay so you know

280
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,500
we're still in progress we're doing

281
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,820
polish so we're still making our way

282
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,579
through stuff and also the size wise

283
00:10:49,579 --> 00:10:51,560
this level that you played today yeah

284
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,180
the largest level that we've done before

285
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:56,389
and in Metro last light was I think 200

286
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:58,670
square meters and this one you played

287
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:01,010
today just this one level was two square

288
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:03,410
kilometers Wow so size wise much much

289
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:04,820
bigger the critical path in this one

290
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:08,089
level is many hours of gameplay and the

291
00:11:08,089 --> 00:11:10,399
you know the extra side content that's

292
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,440
that's in this level is many many more

293
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,279
hours of gameplay

294
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,899
