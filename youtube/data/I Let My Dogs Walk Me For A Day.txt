1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:08,710
listen okay we just got back from Hong

2
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:10,270
Kong a couple days ago

3
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:11,980
please tell me by the way that this says

4
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:14,260
I love Hong Kong and not like I love

5
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,420
something really different we're still

6
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:18,190
like incredibly jet lag like I don't

7
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:19,090
know where I am

8
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:21,640
well all I know is that my dogs are

9
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,890
desperately in need of exercise

10
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:26,380
permit stepped on PD yesterday he went

11
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,690
to the vet like it's it's a lot right

12
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:30,490
now and they really just want to get out

13
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:33,120
this is how bad peach needs exercise I

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,800
feel like I'm on the surface of the Moon

15
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,690
because I don't know what day it is or

16
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:39,340
where I am this was a trend on YouTube

17
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,649
like 4 months ago when people were like

18
00:00:41,649 --> 00:00:44,200
I let my dog walk me for a day so I feel

19
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,720
like I don't have a choice today

20
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,030
do I Kermit maybe it's not gonna be a

21
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:50,620
very exciting video but I think it's

22
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,750
worth a try Rachel do you think so

23
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,790
Kermit thinks it's very worthy endeavor

24
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:58,000
so a lot of people like try their usual

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,500
walks and then let their dog walk that

26
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,660
way I say we take them somewhere that

27
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,610
they've like rarely ever been and then

28
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:05,890
just let them go it gets incredibly hot

29
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:07,810
here during the day so we did wait a

30
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:09,729
little bit into the afternoon not that I

31
00:01:09,729 --> 00:01:11,380
know what fucking time it is anyway it

32
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:17,619
says know where I am you're really not

33
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:19,090
gonna do a lot of the walking here

34
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:21,130
because you're not a walker you're just

35
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:24,069
like a side tracker like doesn't know

36
00:01:24,069 --> 00:01:25,899
how to focus you're gonna be in the

37
00:01:25,899 --> 00:01:28,090
sling for the most of us you want to go

38
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:30,219
for a walk

39
00:01:30,219 --> 00:01:33,490
Oh Kermit do you want to go for a ride

40
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:34,389

78
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,820
literally made it less than a block stop

79
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,410
to smell his own pee

80
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:45,190
that's your pee

81
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:48,420
finally crossing the street like that

82
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,770

83
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:56,920
does of trick-or-treating

84
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:02,740
no feet wants to cross she was crossing

85
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,900
a street she's looking around like a

86
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:11,970
residential street girls open letter

87
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:14,170
looks like we're just following peach

88
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:16,450
and feed karma it's following page all

89
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,390
right crossing the street

90
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:21,500
peaches MJ walk

91
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:29,870
each other call the cops it's so amazing

92
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,730
like as a person you're like alright

93
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:33,320
I'll walk around these couple blocks but

94
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,470
as a dog I can't just like go back it's

95
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:39,740
like across the street and back shitty

96
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,620
walk this this isn't bad

97
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,600
yeah that crosswalks it hurts the car

98
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,160
trying to drive well we're trying to

99
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,750
figure out which direction she was kind

100
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,970
of going sorry I'm just letting my dog

101
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:51,470
make their own choices please someone

102
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:55,220
Drive into its know he really likes this

103
00:05:55,220 --> 00:06:03,640
house walking straight now yeah they do

104
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:08,690
for jaywalking oh yes we don't see a

105
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:19,370
strong independent woman you keep going

106
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:27,979
up to gauge things that your house the

107
00:06:27,979 --> 00:06:29,840
street so many times yeah I think

108
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,450
they're just following the smells which

109
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:33,680
is why it makes absolutely no sense

110
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,760
where we're going

111
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:39,640
Beach I don't thanks to a good place in

112
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:46,790
the world this is such a shit walk this

113
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:48,500
is why you guys seen mommy and daddy to

114
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:52,090
plan your walks cuz this one sucks

115
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:54,440
some other dogs back there that they're

116
00:06:54,440 --> 00:07:00,260
not distracted by I was just gonna sit

117
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:04,280
here in Barton yeah Wow they don't

118
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,750
really want to meet the other dogs but

119
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,360
they do want to look at them I'm so

120
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,500
friendly what's your name it's been like

121
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,750
a half an hour and we've circled around

122
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:18,290
like a block you know we've we've served

123
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:20,240
with around like two separate blocks but

124
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,980
opposite waves like there's no guys

125
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:27,290
now's your chance like this is what you

126
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:29,270
always want you were screaming to go

127
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,860
outside and go for a walk and no we're

128
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:31,940
just standing here

129
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:44,310
she wants a boss

130
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:54,210
you don't try to slingback me water

131
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:56,699
hello I guess we're just gonna stand

132
00:07:56,699 --> 00:08:00,830
here for a while we have roughly stopped

133
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:04,860
why I don't know I guess if you let your

134
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,509
dogs walk you there's just a lot of

135
00:08:06,509 --> 00:08:11,870
standing around we're doing back okay

136
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:16,590
Jenna how's your walk going I guess

137
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:18,479
that's just a misconception about our

138
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,729
own dogs is that they enjoy walking they

139
00:08:20,729 --> 00:08:22,770
don't they talk just smelling other

140
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,600
people's yards we're just heading back

141
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,250
the same way it's like they just

142
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,979
backtrack over and over and over maybe

143
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:31,830
they're just dump used well does this

144
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:33,599
look familiar because we've gone back up

145
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,940
at the same place we just were still

146
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,940
standing doing nothing maybe they like

147
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,490
this perspective we're gonna let the

148
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:43,919
champ have its own little moment the

149
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,779
only time he ever turns on the Jets is

150
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:48,450
when he like sees a bike or a dog or a

151
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:50,810
person he doesn't like be ready bud

152
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:53,310
return well we have found out that

153
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:57,390
Kermit is beta as he just wants to

154
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:00,959
follow whoever is leading oh it's a

155
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,440
daring maneuvers he's got a plan already

156
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,240
he's really on a mission right now

157
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,580
this is why I say marbles too slow at

158
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,140
walking because any time they're

159
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,660
somewhere that he can pee on is where we

160
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,420
stop followers

161
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:18,090
he sees dogs he might pick up the pace

162
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,250
here he knows where they are

163
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:24,060
well he forgot imagine feeling like the

164
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,280
most intense primal rage inside you and

165
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,550
not knowing why that's whose life when

166
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,290
Marvel chooses the walk it's just

167
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:35,700
wherever those dogs are going so for the

168
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,620
sake of that person enjoying their day

169
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:42,080
we've dragged marble away from there oh

170
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,050
that whole interaction just really took

171
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:48,420
it right out I will say Marvel is doing

172
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,630
a much better job than I had anticipated

173
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:53,190
or than the Iggy

174
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,020
he's just being assertive yeah he has no

175
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,030
idea why he wants to go somewhere but he

176
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,830
really knows he wants to go somewhere I

177
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:01,020
feel kind of bad that I underestimated

178
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,030
him they need their leader he's scared

179
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:05,070
of nothing and everything it was it I

180
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:06,600
think one conclusion make him draw is

181
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,150
that every dog likes jaywalking let's

182
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,130
say we've gotten farther with letting

183
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:14,010
marbles leave then with the eyewear with

184
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:19,680
the AG's he wants to stand out

185
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,600
am I gonna seem a little creepy here

186
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,820
anytime we want to keep him moving he

187
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,770
starts to use like peeing one drop on a

188
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:31,710
bush as like an excuse to rest yeah that

189
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:35,160
is the most sure yeah unsure themself

190
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,460
animal

191
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,260
at least he like doesn't trick-or-treat

192
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,730
like he's not constantly trying to go

193
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:41,320
into people's homes yeah he respects

194
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,880
proud of his he's not a trespasser

195
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,240
I generally don't know where we are such

196
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:55,660
an unlikely hero

197
00:10:55,660 --> 00:11:01,200
I agree mama you could have taken in

198
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,080
like he stalked that man from behind and

199
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,060
then he ran away in south

200
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:17,840
[Music]

201
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:21,660
cool

202
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,519
even though now we're letting marbles

203
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,339
leave we've found ourselves back at this

204
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:29,430
intersection this is where you put him

205
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:31,680
down right yeah they like carrier

206
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,569
pigeons like you know he's finding their

207
00:11:33,569 --> 00:11:36,480
way back marvels uses the art of rage to

208
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:43,259
find his way back home he doesn't like

209
00:11:43,259 --> 00:11:51,170
slow down

210
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:53,639
they're very aloof like their people

211
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:55,079
meet them they're that kind of dog

212
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:56,399
that's just like sort of looks around

213
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,350
and you're like hello acknowledge me I'm

214
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,180
meeting you like I'm sorry they're just

215
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,490
weird marbles is not he meets you and

216
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:04,860
has a very strong first impression of

217
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:07,500
you yes he's a decision maker all right

218
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,639
I guess we're gonna have another one of

219
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,639
those stands has decided that we're

220
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:14,190
making a start about things if I knew

221
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:15,810
that that's what they wanted was to walk

222
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:16,860
in one direction and they'll just

223
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,420
promptly turn around and walk the other

224
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,910
we walked them more like that right yeah

225
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:22,230
we just go up and down the same block

226
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:24,480
five times it's what they like

227
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:33,230
apparently they hiccup

228
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:35,900
unlike the Aggies who are very concerned

229
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,270
about where marble is he doesn't get

230
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:51,380
talked about he is that dog I don't know

231
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,970
if you've ever found like a stray dog or

232
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:55,100
cat in your backyard like this is why

233
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,410
he's like really excited good place to

234
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,870
go fin right now he's fixated on finding

235
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:06,080
holes to go

236
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,210
he just read that sign and thought that

237
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:17,100
that was a dog

238
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:21,379
you think that's a dog

239
00:13:21,379 --> 00:13:23,609
the smartest dumbest thing he's ever

240
00:13:23,609 --> 00:13:23,910
done

241
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:27,660
oh we're gonna get out of this person's

242
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:31,319
property he's like trying to find a way

243
00:13:31,319 --> 00:13:46,829
in well stop casing the house Pedro come

244
00:13:46,829 --> 00:14:05,290
drink some water drink

245
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:07,550
just done this whole thing with him

246
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:09,860
there's an awful lot of fees in this

247
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:12,080
particular area Marvel doesn't really

248
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,240
seem to care even though we just went to

249
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,860
the vet literally yesterday because

250
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:18,050
Kermit stepped on a beat on it Herman

251
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:21,320
you're not getting somebody to do the

252
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,680
way dog see bees and flies like a fly is

253
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,660
just a flying raisin and then a bee is

254
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:41,420
the spicy flying raisin and it's been

255
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:44,180
two hours I mean it's been a lot of

256
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,640
standing I don't feel like I went on it

257
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,040
- I feel like I was outside for two

258
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,230
hours I also haven't checked my phone so

259
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,580
I literally have no idea how close we

260
00:14:52,580 --> 00:15:01,610
are to the car running circles in the

261
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:04,190
blocks around our car we haven't

262
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:07,130
traveled far per se but we've done a lot

263
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:11,150
of leaves so dumb that's like a dumbest

264
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:14,630
shit ever you spent two hours and

265
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,640
somehow walked around two miles around

266
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:20,089
the same four blocks sick this is why we

267
00:15:20,089 --> 00:15:22,760
don't let you dumbasses pick a walk he's

268
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,200
just going to every house now trying to

269
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:28,170
get in those people skills

270
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:33,189
people school I'll help you now we're

271
00:15:33,189 --> 00:15:38,079
just looking for couches I will say

272
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,209
though it's been really nice to just

273
00:15:40,209 --> 00:15:42,910
walk them because I don't I feel gelatin

274
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,949
out of my mind it is really interesting

275
00:15:44,949 --> 00:15:49,269
to see just how stupid they are back to

276
00:15:49,269 --> 00:15:53,069
the car it took four minutes to get here

277
00:15:53,069 --> 00:15:57,790
like that's how far away we were you

278
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,589
guys made use of like three blocks for

279
00:15:59,589 --> 00:16:01,180
the past two hours so you guys know that

280
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:03,279
there's like a whole world that you

281
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,269
could walk around

282
00:16:04,269 --> 00:16:05,860
well habla got scared of it beware of

283
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:08,019
dogs sign cuz he thought the sign was a

284
00:16:08,019 --> 00:16:12,009
dog go back home is trying to find the

285
00:16:12,009 --> 00:16:15,220
couch desperately but he refuses to sit

286
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,079
down outside like none of them are that

287
00:16:17,079 --> 00:16:18,759
dog that will ever be comfortable enough

288
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:20,769
to sit outside they only wait till we

289
00:16:20,769 --> 00:16:28,000
get home happy this is the best part of

290
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,009
making a video like this to me is that

291
00:16:30,009 --> 00:16:33,160
they're just like so happy like usually

292
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,720
Wednesday's aren't very fun for them

293
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,089
because we're filming and then I sit and

294
00:16:37,089 --> 00:16:38,680
edit and it's like kind of a boring day

295
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:41,230
for them and they had like a really fine

296
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:47,589
Wednesday with daddy come you're like

297
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:53,290
really happy huh that's an excessive

298
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:57,540
though Kermit that's a lot of swimming

299
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:00,120
yeah you got a beast thing yesterday I

300
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,949
had a bad day but today was a good day

301
00:17:01,949 --> 00:17:04,770
huh well the things that we learned is

302
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:06,240
that they have about a two-hour

303
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,000
tolerance level for being on a walk and

304
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,280
then it's couch time we also learned

305
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,069
that the eggies are shit at deciding

306
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:14,790
where to go

307
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:17,069
peach was the the brains behind the

308
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:19,230
beginning of the walk I'd say she's like

309
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:21,360
the more assertive of the eggy's in

310
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,160
terms of like where to go Carmen is just

311
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,339
like a chilled out guy but marbles is

312
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:29,400
the unlikely hero of the day come here

313
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,700
bud you did so well except for like when

314
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,309
you charged at a person and chased a

315
00:17:35,309 --> 00:17:37,830
couple dogs multiple dogs I mean other

316
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,929
than some of that stuff you're a really

317
00:17:39,929 --> 00:17:43,470
good boy oh okay I think that what we

318
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:45,570
learned here today is that if you let

319
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:47,970
your dogs walk you you gonna have a

320
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:51,809
stupid ass walk it's gonna make no sense

321
00:17:51,809 --> 00:17:54,419
it's gonna be a waste of time it's gonna

322
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:56,490
be stupid as hell I don't know maybe

323
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:58,200
feel like a German Shepherd or something

324
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,240
it'd be like a cool walk they've never

325
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,070
been on not these one I was also

326
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:04,200
surprised that they found like farm

327
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,929
