2
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:14,309
58 seconds of damn logos we here music

3
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:15,630
playing get the play button is displayed

4
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:17,250
on the iPhone which would indicate that

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,840
nothing is actually playing also leave

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,109
t-rex out of this my purge playlist

7
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:24,449
purge playlist also third purge movie

8
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:26,070
continues to perpetuate the myth that at

9
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,539
least half of the population or twisted

10
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:29,670
murderers this is just one of a dozen

11
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,800
protests around our capital after

12
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,989
reports emerge claiming that the new

13
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:36,059
founding fathers had been using the

14
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:38,610
purge to help their own economic agenda

15
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:39,750
people don't give a shit about the

16
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,010
murder they give a shit about the

17
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:42,239
government spending less money on the

18
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,670
poor also an expositional news team they

19
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:45,989
uncover a story as long as it's

20
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:47,399
important to the plot also you brought

21
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:48,809
that up in the last movie rich people

22
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:50,129
are killing poorer people because of

23
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:51,750
economics and blah blah blah but is it

24
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,190
really helping how many people are dying

25
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:54,629
on purge night that really affect the

26
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:56,250
bottom line in a meaningful way whatever

27
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,449
happened to the Carmello guy from the

28
00:00:57,449 --> 00:00:58,800
last movie did this franchise just

29
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,120
lazily replaced their african-american

30
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,469
revolutionary and think I wouldn't

31
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:03,329
notice also I thought the last movie

32
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:04,619
implied Carmelo was going to win this

33
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:06,000
thing why don't we have a third movie

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,250
again 18 years ago the local news

35
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,750
somehow got access to the footage from

36
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,430
the cold open of this movie this montage

37
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:12,840
isn't even trying anymore this is

38
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,189
clearly not the funeral for senator

39
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:15,750
Owens family seems like they just threw

40
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,159
in random funeral footage and hoped no

41
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:18,450
one would notice they clearly haven't

42
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,340
heard of cinema since that's going on

43
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,689
with this TV is this movie trying to

44
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:22,890
tell me the only difference between now

45
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:24,960
and 30 ish years into the future is that

46
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,490
we have a yearly murder holiday and

47
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:28,619
people watch TV in portrait mode this is

48
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:29,880
a warning to all of you who make videos

49
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,170
with your phone this way you keep this

50
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:32,549
up this is how we will all be watching

51
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:34,860
TV in 30 years you bastards is murder

52
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,960
our new image I thought it was and

53
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,939
everyone was explicit about it why is

54
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:40,020
everyone acting like she just said

55
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,210
something shocking celebrate the night

56
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,979
that saved this country from economic

57
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,409
ruin we have other ways maybe this is

58
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:48,060
the problem people like senator own have

59
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,380
only been whispering alternatives to

60
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,450
free murder for a night know what I said

61
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,250
she knows we need what's he so worried

62
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,899
about it's not purge night yet no one

63
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:56,460
gets killed on regular nights there has

64
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,729
been far less prize this is crap in his

65
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:01,170
defense according to the title cards of

66
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:03,030
the last two movies he's right also this

67
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,500
is supposed to be a presidential debate

68
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,180
you can't just interrupt your opponent

69
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,079
if you don't like what they're saying

70
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:08,580
even if it oh wait

71
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,530
so no income

72
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,080
people are killed during the purge than

73
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,000
anyone else I feel like after so many

74
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,080
years of this people would have gotten

75
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,640
smarter about defending themselves even

76
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,080
if they are low-income people like

77
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,580
setting up some deadly home alone traps

78
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,440
and buying easily acquired guns or just

79
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,610
plain leaving the country for 12 hours

80
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,530
she got some new titties but she got

81
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:28,020
some big-ass balls that's racist I put

82
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,120
you over to seven wait America now has

83
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,920
these new founding fathers that created

84
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,360
a murder holiday but we still have an

85
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,560
election system with an electoral

86
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,910
college you think that if everyone was

87
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,260
okay with the purge they'd be okay with

88
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,220
getting rid of the electoral system

89
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,050
altogether but you'd be wrong apparently

90
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:41,760
also the idea that they wouldn't engage

91
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,830
in election fraud is preposterous Looby

92
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,480
decides to utilize the rain machine on a

93
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,420
sunny day just how pointless is a

94
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,709
jump-scare when the purge hasn't even

95
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:50,400
started yet

96
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,410
also what an asshole the purge is

97
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:55,050
Halloween for a dog I'm pretty sure

98
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,790
Halloween is Halloween for adults also

99
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,410
how is this guy avoided being killed on

100
00:02:58,410 --> 00:02:59,880
purge night this is movie saying his

101
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,470
booming mass business makes him one of

102
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,060
those elite curse who don't die during

103
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,769
the purge hell I got to a wealthy

104
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:06,420
stockbroker in the last movie surely

105
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,410
someone wants to kill this asshole

106
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:09,330
they're being called murder tourists

107
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:10,800
because we are clever anymore

108
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,810
we had to experience the purge this guy

109
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:14,280
heard that reporter from earlier say

110
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,140
people are arriving from Spain Denmark

111
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,600
South Africa so he decided to try all

112
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,980
those accents at the same time just to

113
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,900
cover his bases he touched me and I

114
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,799
scream rape um there are cameras in this

115
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:27,630
place right that's why he knew to go

116
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,190
back here in the first place not a great

117
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,810
threat but luckily somebody these two

118
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,340
thieving chicks respect is about to give

119
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,079
him back up that's a new record to me

120
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:35,280
it's convenient that Kimmy's friend

121
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,989
recognized who this is so that we could

122
00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:38,489
know who this is even though it ends up

123
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:40,170
serving very little to the plot I want

124
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:41,790
men in there I feel like Leo's job is

125
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,290
mostly pointing at areas and saying he

126
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:46,109
wants men there men here men here

127
00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:47,280
how many men could he possibly have

128
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,140
access to is anyone keeping track of how

129
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,940
many men he wants everywhere maybe this

130
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,109
is why the unemployment rate is so low

131
00:03:52,109 --> 00:03:53,609
if I don't pay it by tomorrow

132
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:55,799
I have no purge coverage for his store a

133
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:57,540
question I never asked is how's the

134
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,160
purge affects small business owners also

135
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,600
if you're gonna be this blatantly evil

136
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,250
why even bother with a purge this kind

137
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,019
of tactic is of course super illegal but

138
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:05,310
if the insurance companies are really

139
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,900
behind all this purge madness then they

140
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,280
don't really have to worry about the law

141
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,290
or anything right I have no insurance I

142
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:11,250
screwed

143
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,200
Joe conveniently loses his insurance to

144
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,459
give him some vague motivation to

145
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:16,229
participate in purge night that not the

146
00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:18,180
pot calling the kettle Brown Joe said

147
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,560
black with his mouth which would be the

148
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,940
correct euphemism but it's always said

149
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,740
Brown given the other offensive things

150
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,030
Joe will say later in this movie this

151
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:24,300
seems

152
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,860
odd place to censor even though this

153
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,449
brick house has these giant barricades

154
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:28,919
Joanna's team still felt the need to

155
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:30,449
have these guys standing outside in

156
00:04:30,449 --> 00:04:32,610
plain view with no visible body armor as

157
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:34,229
we see this warning for the third time

158
00:04:34,229 --> 00:04:35,639
in three movies I'm wondering if they're

159
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:36,960
ever going to explain what happens to

160
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,490
people who commit crimes outside a purge

161
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:39,990
night or if anyone's ever been convicted

162
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:41,520
of killing someone two minutes after the

163
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,990
7:00 a.m. deadline or if anyone's ever

164
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:44,280
driven from Nashville to Knoxville to

165
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,599
kill somebody and forgot about the time

166
00:04:45,599 --> 00:04:48,120
zone change and for the first time since

167
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,520
its inception no one has been granted

168
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,099
special immunity from the purge also

169
00:04:53,099 --> 00:04:54,509
they got rid of that pesky class 4

170
00:04:54,509 --> 00:04:56,280
weapon rule I bet the weird guy who owns

171
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,569
a tank that I just made up is super

172
00:04:57,569 --> 00:04:59,219
excited about that senator you should be

173
00:04:59,219 --> 00:05:00,719
in the den she should also be wearing a

174
00:05:00,719 --> 00:05:01,889
bulletproof vest and armed with a

175
00:05:01,889 --> 00:05:05,190
flamethrower and grenade belt no one has

176
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,330
driven by and shot these people yet

177
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:07,889
Katniss Everdeen has definitely had

178
00:05:07,889 --> 00:05:09,479
enough of that Capitol Bulls than is now

179
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:11,219
killing innocent but scary druggies on

180
00:05:11,219 --> 00:05:13,319
the street Wow seriously a guillotine

181
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:15,150
how did they drag this thing in an alley

182
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:17,580
or did they buy the IKEA a new license

183
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,139
during their purge sale this guy is

184
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:20,729
driving incredibly well given that he is

185
00:05:20,729 --> 00:05:21,569
wearing that mask

186
00:05:21,569 --> 00:05:22,860
I mean think of the kind of work someone

187
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,659
has to put into scrolling purge in blood

188
00:05:24,659 --> 00:05:26,550
on the Lincoln Memorial columns looks

189
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,259
great in a sadistic movie but who are

190
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:29,909
you gonna trust on purge night to steady

191
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:31,229
the ladder while you write the letters I

192
00:05:31,229 --> 00:05:32,580
bet it was the guy who they hired to

193
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,139
make the movies theatrical poster also

194
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:36,060
Abe Lincoln is not a planet at the a pin

195
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,610
the scene Oh Suns going down

196
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:39,479
hey looks like someone needs our

197
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:41,159
services you know our services which

198
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:42,479
definitely you know but the unseen

199
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,250
audience doesn't it's like exposition

200
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,289
only more worthless it's purge night you

201
00:05:46,289 --> 00:05:47,759
don't sneak up on black people

202
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:48,930
I wouldn't sneak up on anyone during

203
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,789
purge night I want you to go home and be

204
00:05:50,789 --> 00:05:51,210
safe

205
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:52,469
yeah but the purge has already started

206
00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:54,060
going home would be the most unsafe

207
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,110
thing he could do at this point

208
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:56,400
Lily expects me to believe that this

209
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,990
crazy girl took the time to meticulously

210
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,520
cover this car with Christmas lights and

211
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,690
then successfully drive it to this

212
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,129
location even though the windshield is

213
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:04,860
entirely covered with lights

214
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,240
these girls / the director were too

215
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,830
cheap to buy the Miley version of party

216
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,360
in the USA so they opted for the Kidz

217
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,430
Bop version oh no it's exactly who I

218
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,140
thought it was congratulations purge

219
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,730
election year on the most non dramatic

220
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:16,990
reveal in cinema history

221
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:19,000
and I'll want my candy bah this just

222
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,260
shows what a privileged life this girl

223
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,610
has after killing her parents who were

224
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:23,470
probably just being normal parents early

225
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:24,700
thought is to enact vengeance on the

226
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,930
shopkeep who wouldn't let her steal a

227
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:27,850
candy bar also are you gonna tell these

228
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:28,990
girls that their guns are obviously

229
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:31,930
plastic or should i that's the moment

230
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:33,640
where any normal insane teenager would

231
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,130
just turn into a whiny teenager again RT

232
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:37,570
took care of my mom and dad tonight

233
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:39,460
honestly I'm surprised a parricide among

234
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,170
angsty teenagers isn't a much larger

235
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:42,340
problem during the purge we've

236
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,810
experienced three purges and this is the

237
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:45,430
only example I can think of also good

238
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:46,270
luck with being an orphan

239
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,650
I'm sure that's way better than your mom

240
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,330
grounding you for a few weeks or Venus

241
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:50,680
Pit let's pretend for a second that

242
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,000
those guns are real and asked the

243
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,440
question where the hell did these girls

244
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,390
get these gold rhinestone aks that's

245
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:57,010
limited to have an armory in the future

246
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:59,350
as we then why doesn't approach calm

247
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:01,450
down dude so is Senator roan secretly

248
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:03,460
complying with the nffa s plot the

249
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,780
killer because it seems rather

250
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,340
convenient she'd want to have a private

251
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,020
conversation with Leo in the debt giving

252
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,070
these guys enough time to fiddle with

253
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,750
the cameras and I can only assume their

254
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,190
entire plan banks on Leo getting

255
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,840
distracted for a moment Leo the amazing

256
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,130
security expert doesn't notice the

257
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:16,750
timestamp is incorrect on this camera

258
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:17,530
white power

259
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:18,970
what's the electric company doing here

260
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:21,850
at this hour oh I'm coming outside noise

261
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,590
right because why stay here when you can

262
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:24,790
see all these different angles at once

263
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:26,080
and you could just go outside and have

264
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,550
limited visibility of your surroundings

265
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:29,470
this video is on a loop doesn't anyone

266
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:30,250
watch speed anymore

267
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,960
and there's a lot to teach us hey no not

268
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,790
that Bobby Leo's going to find out his

269
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,530
team's been compromised but somehow none

270
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:36,760
of the bad guys who also use these

271
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,290
radios understand that even though these

272
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:39,970
Klan SWAT team members had the draw on

273
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:41,740
Leo he was still able to stab both of

274
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,150
them without either of them shooting you

275
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:44,020
know the biggest problem with this

276
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:47,970
franchise is that it's just too subtle

277
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:50,440
this guy is a sniper rifle and this is

278
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,130
the best he can do

279
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:52,750
man it's too bad that I've had many you

280
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,100
left him the house isn't actually a bomb

281
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,560
oh it is excellent what happens he using

282
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,400
for this I connect bomb

283
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,660
why are they doing this right now they

284
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,800
just run the risk of getting killed

285
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,360
themselves and having their death truck

286
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,880
stolen is why I try and make your drone

287
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,410
inconspicuous when you can cover it with

288
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:10,090
multicolored lights that's how a man

289
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,620
drone I guess you can call the Chinese

290
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,270
factory where this drone was made a home

291
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:14,920
I'm sure somebody lives there it's

292
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,100
behind a veil 35 yards back 15 yards up

293
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,930
thrown is kind of cocky regarding her

294
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:23,140
distance estimating skills seriously

295
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,340
this crew of Bergers were just lying

296
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,630
around waiting for someone to come by

297
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,160
and that's dedication to the craft and

298
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,630
probably mighty born Charlie and Leo

299
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,130
both dropped their guard because movie

300
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:33,250
oh man they shot Lincoln this guy can't

301
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:33,669
catch a break

302
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:35,919
senator Joe is able to recognize the

303
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,240
senator from a distance without getting

304
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,550
a good look at her face China is the key

305
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:41,409
this is cute Marcos but I'm sure the

306
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:42,669
senator knows how the electoral college

307
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:44,830
that inexplicably still exists works I

308
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:46,660
know a little bit about first thing I

309
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,400
could help you every day in Juarez was

310
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,840
like medical school these thieving

311
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,190
whores managed to come back right when

312
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:52,510
Joe wasn't on the roof to notice them

313
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:54,580
also these girls meticulously decked out

314
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,440
a second car and Christmas lights I'm

315
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,390
gonna get that candy pop I hope Joe

316
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,650
learns a valuable lesson tonight

317
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:01,060
just let the crazy girl have the candy

318
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:03,100
bar and a call Joe plays the pronoun

319
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,480
game so that everybody has to ask who

320
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,630
the hell her is executive decision I'm

321
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,250
with Leo the senator thinks that she can

322
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,780
issue executive decisions even though

323
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:15,430
she isn't president yet I just want to

324
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:16,720
remind everyone that Kimmy wanting her

325
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,490
free candy bar is a major plot point in

326
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:20,290
this movie Kimmy Jimmy's friend don't

327
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:21,910
hear the loud band barreling toward them

328
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,470
Judy goes out of its way to show me

329
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:25,180
Kimmy's boots flying off yet here her

330
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,890
boots are completely still on loopy puts

331
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:28,330
an American Horror Story roanoke

332
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:30,160
commercial in the middle of itself how

333
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,050
did it get to this probably when murder

334
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:33,280
was legalized and endorsed by the

335
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,660
shadowy religious death cult that

336
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:35,500
controls the government

337
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,520
yeah damn conniving duplicitous crooked

338
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,110
fucking politicians I don't think I've

339
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:42,040
heard this much use of the word

340
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,240
cocksuckers buy a whole bunch of

341
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,410
different characters since the usual

342
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:45,940
suspects sounds like this is more a

343
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,770
screenwriter term than every characters

344
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:50,020
go-to word in the movie anybody hit okay

345
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,970
okay even though that giant machine gun

346
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:53,740
turned the van to Swiss cheese and the

347
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,089
only person who got hit was that kid I'd

348
00:09:55,089 --> 00:09:56,589
already forgotten about booty pads run

349
00:09:56,589 --> 00:09:58,180
time with slow-motion gang fight that I

350
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,860
really don't care about there was no way

351
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,150
they could have known me be in this band

352
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:03,820
does it matter they did what it sounds

353
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,260
like it very much matters like the

354
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,850
entire key to keeping the senator alive

355
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:08,709
kind of matters we get it leo you're a

356
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:10,209
badass but this is definitely a moment

357
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:11,390
when you're allowed to phone

358
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:13,220
and so the bullet that shot him when

359
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,840
they were escaping was also a tracking

360
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,910
device you movie yeah well I wish it

361
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:17,660
were that simple

362
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,370
y'all need to see this y'all need to see

363
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:21,860
this cliche was a whole bunch of Negroes

364
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,720
coming right this way we sittin up here

365
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,360
like a bucket of motherfuckin oh that's

366
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,640
like super racist but I guess it's okay

367
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,930
for this guy to say that I guess was a

368
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:34,760
Crip was well that was a risky flip of

369
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,020
the coin it's good they were the gang

370
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,280
that you thought they were even though

371
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,600
you had little indication of which gang

372
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,980
they were in the first place we're not

373
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:40,820
gonna hurt you

374
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:43,070
just help my fucking boy he's gonna die

375
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:44,630
was that their hope all along to get

376
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:46,400
this guy's kid on the van because before

377
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,450
that they all look like they were gonna

378
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:49,190
kill everybody in the van and then Joe

379
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,630
did some sort of crip whistle and

380
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,220
everybody shut the hell up now Joe is

381
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,570
probably regretting letting it slip that

382
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,790
he was a crypt we help you do something

383
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,380
for us to me it seems like the gang

384
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,760
really lucked out they now have the

385
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,900
opportunity to kill some white

386
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,240
supremacist call this is safe zone did

387
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,260
you come up with that all by yourself

388
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:05,120
these are the real victims of the purge

389
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,620
if all the dead people in the streets

390
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,850
could argue this point I'm sure they

391
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:10,400
would I've heard stories of tactics that

392
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,650
we will employ our first name Ron

393
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:14,270
chooses this moment right after she's

394
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:16,040
been rescued to question Dante's tactics

395
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,330
haven't mentioned this guy's orgy of

396
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:18,860
evidence that he's a racist yet I mean

397
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,200
two Confederate flags a swastika a bevy

398
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,060
of tattoos that probably represent white

399
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,770
guys are the bestest and that's not even

400
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:26,000
counting the white power on the back of

401
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,740
his uniform and head back to the deli

402
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,540
I'm sorry but you don't own a deli it's

403
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,100
a convenience store second of all why

404
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,390
the would you feel the need to go back

405
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,800
there if it was going to get looted that

406
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,210
ship has probably already sailed at this

407
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:37,850
point fine I'll Drive you Laney is

408
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:39,410
easily convinced instead of being

409
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:40,820
suspicious when anyone opens the door

410
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,410
why don't you try talking to Dante about

411
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,240
his facility in operation you'd get some

412
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,260
answers and we'd get some more

413
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:48,320
exposition what are you doing here if

414
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,610
this is such an important room to keep

415
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:51,080
people out of why is it so easy for any

416
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,970
asshole to walk into why do you have all

417
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:54,770
this oh this is our clues board it

418
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:56,330
allows someone who happens to snoop into

419
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:57,950
this room to slowly figure out our plot

420
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,780
to kill members of the nffa but our

421
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,550
government trucks I saw them on YouTube

422
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,140
from last year's purge someone watched

423
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,550
everything wrong with the purge anarchy

424
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:06,800
the ton on the original Church has been

425
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,110
closed up since the 50s but we've

426
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:10,610
reopened it we're gonna walk right

427
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:12,380
through there and into that church

428
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:14,000
without anybody even knowing why haven't

429
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,680
we done it already good question we had

430
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,660
to wait because hey does anyone know why

431
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,310
we waited to do this is it so the good

432
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:21,600
guys could uncover this plot

433
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,270
go Leo seems to assume there was one

434
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,860
booby trap and there can't possibly be a

435
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,300
second or third so they keep running

436
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,890
like they were before I can't win like

437
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:30,960
this it goes against everything that I

438
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,430
believe in this statement would make

439
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:33,930
sense if roans people were the ones that

440
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:35,310
concocted this plan to kill the minister

441
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:36,360
but it was a completely independent

442
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,340
group seems like Ron thinks that by not

443
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,840
having the power to stop Dante and his

444
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,250
men from killing the minister she's

445
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,930
somehow compromising her morals which is

446
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,190
disjointed that doesn't really make any

447
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:46,800
sense if they assassinate him he becomes

448
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,170
a martyr we lose that's a legit reason

449
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:50,100
let's go with that

450
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,090
did they really need to write in

451
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:52,830
back-to-back justifications for I guess

452
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,510
so even after getting t-boned while

453
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:55,680
everyone was standing in the back of the

454
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,240
van they all seemed to be mostly okay

455
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,610
also the klu klux walk clan was able to

456
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:01,230
find a senator and company with dumb

457
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:03,050
luck I guess

458
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:05,190
fruitless handgun shooting in an armored

459
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:07,080
truck again what's with the candles it

460
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,250
feels like big candle has some

461
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,510
incriminating photos of Hollywood

462
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:11,100
somewhere and it keeps cashing in like a

463
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,660
picture of Hollywood's O's not wearing a

464
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,700
bra or something I mean jeez get paid to

465
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,440
deliver the package not gift-wrapped

466
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,760
baldie waits until they are about done

467
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,710
tying her down before he says this well

468
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:24,000
CIN scour sanitize and sterilize our

469
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,130
souls tremendous alliteration there but

470
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:27,750
will you explain how you plan to sin

471
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:32,280
your souls and isn't that our job let us

472
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:32,970
begin

473
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:34,500
does it still count for all of you if

474
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,670
it's just one person up there killing

475
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,530
Alice do you know about the tunnel well

476
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:38,880
no need to explain that to a bunch of

477
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,110
guys who might be ready to kill me right

478
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,610
now they're just gonna have to admire my

479
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:43,440
dramatic balls also that's what you get

480
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,730
for leaving your master plan up on a

481
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:47,400
cork board Harmon will be the first

482
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,800
perjure of thee as is purge mask

483
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,540
tradition the creepiest dude gets to go

484
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,310
first fun fact about Herman he was

485
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:54,870
killed in last year's purge good news

486
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,940
Rome got the gag out of her oh wait

487
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,680
never mind it's quite convenient for our

488
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,660
heroes that warns is the slowest throat

489
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,250
slitter in existence giving them ample

490
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,020
time to set up and take the shot no one

491
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,460
in the balcony is getting shot at even

492
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,630
though they all have basically no cover

493
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:09,750
especially Lanie and they were all saved

494
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,960
by bulletproof fuse

495
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:16,010
was that it was bullets oh come on we

496
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:17,330
all know this guy would be a sniveling

497
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:18,410
coward if he was actually in the

498
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:19,460
situation but who needs

499
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,020
multi-dimensional characters right

500
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:23,540
I like black people but angle it Josh

501
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,310
shoot these white folks Joe inexplicably

502
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:27,110
makes it about race for the seventh or

503
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:32,390
eighth time I am well still requires the

504
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:33,710
votes of the people in the electoral

505
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,300
college I mean great cinema and

506
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,410
everything but there's not much you can

507
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:38,600
do about it what about these people the

508
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,650
purge must be coming to an end soon

509
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:41,030
right why not just leave them there and

510
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,620
then come back for them when it's not as

511
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,240
murdery outside better yet everyone

512
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,920
stays put until 7:00 that really so hard

513
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,960
leo is about to successfully fight this

514
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,130
guy even though he would shot the

515
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:50,240
shoulder and has lost a lot of blood

516
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,860
there's anything that purge franchise

517
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,060
has taught me it's a bullet to the

518
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,140
shoulder really isn't all that bad

519
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,000
orals vest may be bulletproof but it's

520
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,100
not even a tiny little knife proof the

521
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,960
nffa decided to keep the election system

522
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,970
mostly intact but move the day we vote

523
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:03,980
from November 8th to May 26th because

524
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,900
you know a nation reborn movie somehow

525
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,100
makes the state of Tennessee a blue

526
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,510
state even though nearly all of its

527
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:09,860
southeastern brethren accept South

528
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,870
Carolina are red also Vermont and Maine

529
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,370
are staunch red states in this reality

530
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,770
the fuck that the senator has also taken

531
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:17,570
Florida how nice she took Marcoses

532
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:19,400
advice win more electoral votes than

533
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,320
your opponent also despite Marcos being

534
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,580
proven right here the problem is

535
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,020
according to this map she was already

536
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:26,090
way over 270 electoral votes before

537
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:27,560
Florida so Florida's role in the

538
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,930
election year can go itself and ff8

539
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,330
supporters are reacting violently to

540
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:34,310
this defeat oh god I hope this movie

541
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:40,720
isn't predicting the future

542
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,660
it is a disaster

543
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:48,529
mom's showing up Creole gumbo you just

544

545
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:51,290
can be a bad thing

546
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:54,080
hope can drive a man insane Jesus for

547
00:15:54,080 --> 00:16:04,040
