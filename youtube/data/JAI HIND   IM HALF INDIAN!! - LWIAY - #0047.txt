1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,900
Sponsor, sponsor!

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:07,180
Yes, ah ah, ah

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:08,180
Finally

4
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:10,800
Aimcontrollers.com, baby.

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,120
That's right.

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,440
They designed a controller. It's very premium.

7
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,860
Look at that, it matches my chair

8
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:24,300
Not only can you customize your own design and make it very sexy like this one, but it also feels very premium.

9
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:30,480
It's got all these kinds of textures on it. You know, it just feels good in your hands. What can I say?

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:37,100
What's cool about this, is that you guys are gonna be able... I'm giving you this opportunity, that's right,

11
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:44,200
To design the official (this is just a prototype) design of the PewDiePie controller

12
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:51,640
Which will be sold worldwide, baby! [hell yeah] So check out the link description for this webpage. It works better on computer.

13
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:55,140
Basically, it's very simple. You can just upload any picture..

14
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,780
See?!? Already this looks insanely good.

15
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,960
You can customize the grip texture color,

16
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,060
You can customize the paddles in the back,

17
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,260
Anything on this baby, you can customize,

18
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:09,380
So, I want you guys to be creative, (you) can be artistic,

19
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:14,980
You can make meme-worthy ones, (you) can even change the text on the back and (on) the front and write whatever.

20
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:19,300
I'll write my gamertag 'iloveass2', I'll pick the winner next week.

21
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:25,860
So, submit your designs and again.. Thanks aimcontrollers.com for sponsoring this video. Very nice product.

22
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,380
Check it out. Now without further ado, Let's jump into it.

23
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:38,640
(LWIAY Theme Song)

24
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:45,830
Alright, since reddit has changed now, I'm just gonna go from top to bottom from now on. &quot;Instead of fighting an Indian&quot;

25
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:50,870
&quot;Why not become one? I am NOT Indian, by the way.&quot; Thank you for clarifying

26
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:58,470
&quot;I am an Indian and this is on trending here. Don't worry pewds. We got you. Just title your next video as&quot;

27
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:05,420
&quot;Jai Hindi (hail India) and put the Indian flag in the thumbnail and click&quot;

28
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:09,560
&quot;bait the title as &quot;I am half Indian&quot;&quot;

29
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,880
&quot;Watch it blow up.&quot; I feel like this is bait

30
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,410
to put me in trouble

31
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:22,590
But I also think it's a great clickbait, so it cancels out. Alright, we'll try this out

32
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:30,080
You better not be trolling me. I swear to God. In case you don't know the context, that's right, this channel is at war

33
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,770
We're at war everybody

34
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:39,840
Against the Indian. The Indian Channel T-Series is about to overtake this channel in just the span of a few months

35
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,860
Jai Hind

36
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:46,800
&quot;-Humility is a virtue. I don't want to be the biggest channel. -That is why it must be you&quot;

37
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,650
I'm pretty sure there's a lot of channels

38
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:53,060
More appropriate than me to be number one

39
00:02:53,060 --> 00:03:01,350
And I'm pretty sure it's not me and I'm pretty sure it's not T-Series, ok? This guy said it was his last day

40
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:03,750
Sorry

41
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,989
McDonald's merch, that is awesome

42
00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:08,900
(kills memes)

43
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,360
Upgrade

44
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,820
Absolute MADLAD

45
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,640
I finally made it into the LWIAY and made

46
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:22,380
PewDiePie smile, I will cherish this moment forever. That is not a smile

47
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:26,040
Ok, I didn't smile. Ok, so whatever

48
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:32,370
Whatever moment of happiness, you got just delete it. Ok, cuz it gave me nothing

49
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:41,580
Nothing. He said on LWIAY he would bring it back. Maybe he forgot. Let's remind him again. Oh, yeah. Next week!

50
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:49,130
Ok, we're doing the... We're doing the controller thing , alright. Let's do that first, then the week after we'll do the green screen

51
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:54,080
Okay, what is this?

52
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,300
This is not PewDiePie lore, okay

53
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:03,209
Out of all things that we put in the videos to create lore

54
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:04,800
This?

55
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:11,840
This is what you're focusing. Yeah. Okay. No, you got us they we have to I get the joke, but for real

56
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:18,320
Why does the mirror the video, it's obviously a call or help. Okay, I don't mirror the video for anything

57
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:23,480
It means nothing. Okay, stop reading into nothing, Jesus

58
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:29,700
The absolute madlad. &quot;Gave myself a ticket so that they won't&quot;

59
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:34,900
Okay, this is not worthy of absolute madlad.

60
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:40,800
Madlad, perhaps. Okay, I do this all the time. That's right

61
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:46,250
If you ever get a ticket, just save it and then put it on your car so you won't get another one

62
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:55,320
Although it doesn't work cuz they give you another one anyways. Ligma died of ninja. What's ni-

63
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,419
You know he's married, right

64
00:04:57,419 --> 00:05:02,610
the Curious Case of Felix Kjellberg. Late 2017

65
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:05,610
early 2018

66
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:08,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

67
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,210
He's becoming part of the nine year old army himself

68
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:15,840
Once we have defeated all the Indians and I have transformed into a nine year old myself

69
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:24,300
I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine. This is how we count years on the Pewdiepie Channel. Ten years old

70
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:33,270
Nine years old plus one. Bonus year, bonus year. That's right. I am nine plus

71
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:38,430
Twenty one bonus years.  Damn, I'm really old, Jesus

72
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:39,510
Wait

73
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:41,610
Twenty... No, wait

74
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:49,940
19, 19 bonus... Math, how does it work? Nineteen? I said 19. I said 19. Shut up. The gang is all here

75
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:55,040
We are all taking a stance against the Indians on YouTube.

76
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,660
T-Series must be stopped. This is just some sort of joke

77
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:04,880
Okay, it's not just about me being the biggest subscribed channel. It's about doing what's right.

78
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,450
We have Mr.Beast on our side. We have

79
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:12,890
Well, apparently Jake Paul's on our side. Vladimir Putin

80
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:21,200
All right, fine. Kim Jong-Un... I didn't know he had a Twitter. Logan Paul is on our side. Wow, amazing. Thank you

81
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:29,330
What a strong army of nine-year-olds

82
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:36,280
Petition to change up votes and down votes into brofist and T-Series. Petition denied

83
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:41,140
Okay, but then Australians will have brofist as down vote.

84
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:47,000
With the wedding getting closer, let's remind- Stop reminding me of stuff.

85
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,300
I say a lot of things. Okay. Stop hopping

86
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,430
What I say now

87
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:51,700
Oh

88
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:54,890
It's this one. &quot;Have to wear a full-body

89
00:06:54,890 --> 00:07:01,010
Leotard on your wedding day or have the person you are marrying wear the full body-&quot;

90
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:03,020
Please guys, please

91
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:06,080
No

92
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:12,230
All right, you can remind me all you want, the date hasn't happened yet

93
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:22,560
I never back out on my word. I'm a man of my word. I always do everything I say I will

94
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,070
Anyone... Any of y'all think Mr. Beast

95
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:28,520
should make a video of him making

96
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,500
Ten- A hundred thousand YouTube accounts to subscribe to Pewdiepie.

97
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:41,160
Pewdiepie's subreddit wants me to do this but what these nine year olds don't realize is I've been doing this all along. How do you think he became one?

98
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:46,110
Well, do a better job then, Jesus Christ. Mr. Beast, please

99
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:51,600
Amp up the pace, man. Come on. Oh, there it is. Someone already made it for me

100
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,740
Perfect

101
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,620
It looks awful, but I'll take it. I'll take it.

102
00:07:55,620 --> 00:08:00,240
Scientists have developed the first telescoping contact lens

103
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,639
This lens is capable of zooming your vision three times

104
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:10,740
All we asked for was to exit YouTube while playing music

105
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,330
Oh

106
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:13,470
my god

107
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:17,749
It was me all along. Does anyone know what happened to this channel?

108
00:08:17,749 --> 00:08:21,900
Like they're just deleting their videos now. But why, what is the reason.

109
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:27,750
There is an Indian conspiracy, I swear, it is

110
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:32,789
I don't like this

111
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:48,250
Who's voting for T-Series, what is this?

112
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,960
Actual footage of

113
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,070
pdp-10

114
00:08:51,070 --> 00:09:00,010
challenging T-Series. Since T-Series is kind of like Indian vivo, it doesn't count. Yes, it does! Yeah

115
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:02,830
We need to stop before it's too late

116
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:09,160
People are talking about T-Series like it will take over and I say nay, Indians

117
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,200
Try again next time

118
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,190
Okay

119
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:18,750
That's it for this week's Lawa.  As always, thank you guys for posing all the memes. I very much appreciate it. It's always fun

120
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:23,680
I'm so proud that we have this community and I can't wait to see where you guys are gonna

121
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:32,740
Submit for the aim controller design. Should we do the highest voted one wins? I feel like that one just makes it I

122
00:09:32,740 --> 00:10:02,000
Don't know. Yeah. Sure. Let's do that. Thanks for smashing like and subscribing. I'll see you guys tomorrow with another video
