to 13 because I put on a few here

27
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:19,640
Kingdom up so let's just get started

28
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:50,050
with our top list go

29
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:56,470
[Music]

30
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:01,190
[Music]

31
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:04,310
meaning I never got that Ganga connemara

32
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:08,820
would number 13 Kingdom Hearts 3 this

33
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,979
surprise pic from me because I don't

34
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:14,070
know jack about Kingdom life I haven't

35
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:16,890
played it but I tell you what because

36
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:19,080
they they did something similar to what

37
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,330
they did in Final Fantasy 15 which we

38
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:25,200
played you know with the boy band but

39
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,060
they've been doing like action and so I

40
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,910
saw you know different elements of the

41
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,860
levels that looked a little bit more

42
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,720
engaging to me rather than you know the

43
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,030
sort of traditional JRPG or some of the

44
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,340
old systems that they do so because it's

45
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,050
a little bit more action-oriented and

46
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:43,200
because Disney the Empire that Disney is

47
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,560
is now adding so many new properties I'm

48
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,620
wondering every time are we gonna see

49
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,890
you know star wars up in there we're

50
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:56,010
gonna see Marvel up in there in addition

51
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:59,220
to the Donald and Goofy and the you know

52
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,440
all these other levels now there's a lot

53
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,230
of well-known annoying levels from some

54
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:06,269
of the previous Kingdom Hearts so I'm

55
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:07,680
interested into seeing if we're gonna

56
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,600
revisit some of the old levels from the

57
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,000
games or is it gonna be geared more

58
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,400
towards new fans like me and other Joe

59
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,110
who have never played a single one

60
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,760
because if you're coming in at three I'm

61
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,920
a little worried that I'm gonna be so

62
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,780
freaking lost you know what I'm saying

63
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,330
so I hope it's it's it's tailored to

64
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:32,240
both we'll see

65
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:41,660
[Music]

66
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:44,420
no 12 which is my pick which fall out

67
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:50,240

68
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,340
girlfriends over fall now they've broken

69
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:56,000
up with me consume and it's funny at

70
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,350
different points in my life when it was

71
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:59,420
a top down fall out love girlfriend and

72
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,910
then it was in the engaging I what was

73
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:05,540
it Emily or Madison us cuz that's all I

74
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:11,090
played so yeah well I gotta get one

75
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:13,400
again first before I lose another one

76
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,459
but yeah job this one not much has been

77
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:18,920
said there's a lot of speculations might

78
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,739
be online survival I don't know that's

79
00:04:21,739 --> 00:04:23,390
what I'm gonna send him out perfect

80
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:25,850
opportunity to check out what it is yeah

81
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:28,760
what would you be disappointed if it was

82
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,330
uh uh you know five hundred players rust

83
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,490
you know Ark kind of you know build

84
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:37,880
stuff what would you want do you want to

85
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,650
single-player because they're mine I

86
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:42,680
might be sick I love role-playing games

87
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,840
single-player games but there's so many

88
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,880
of you coming out on e3 that I was

89
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,430
looking at so I'm not opposed to

90
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,500
something new here okay I'm willing to

91
00:04:51,500 --> 00:05:14,430
give it a shot alright

92
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:17,830
so coming at my number eleven to tie it

93
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:20,500
in kind of close to fallout is Metro

94
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:25,030
this is yeah yes yeah it's like a couple

95
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:28,780
years after last light hmm and which I

96
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:31,300
loved last light yeah I like the Metro

97
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,520
series and basically this is gonna be

98
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,460
you're gonna flight hostels and new

99
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:39,430
crazy creatures so there yeah I'm

100
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,530
excited about their weather system and

101
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:43,660
it's gonna look very dynamic yeah I saw

102
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,760
a lot of stuff on it like you're kind of

103
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,710
centered around a train you're traveling

104
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:50,650
from area to area on this train so that

105
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,870
is gonna give us an opportunity to get

106
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,550
around quicker and get to different

107
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:56,560
locations so that I'm excited to travel

108
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,900
and then I think they also I think they

109
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,970
also removed some of the like scarcity

110
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:03,880
like you I think you're using bullets is

111
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,970
is you know money and they're not gonna

112
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:08,440
do that no more now you're just gonna

113
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,630
have plenty of ammunition to kill the

114
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:11,919
things which is good

115
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,620
well like Ewing this yeah I what I want

116
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,200
from this is I want this to dip into

117
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,539
horror a lot because remember what am I

118
00:06:19,539 --> 00:06:22,680
saying apart you terrible it's terrible

119
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,240
but but I wanted to dip in there you

120
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,560
know that segment where you're in the

121
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,390
shoe and there's a fucking spiders or

122
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,760
whatever those things were and yes so I

123
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:34,000
want many more of those elements and and

124
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,889
much more so we're super excited for

125
00:06:35,889 --> 00:06:39,520
Metro Exodus

126
00:06:39,520 --> 00:07:00,800
number ten samurai you are warrior I can

127
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,850
see that

128
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:09,610
you trained your whole life for this

129
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:11,330
number 10

130
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:14,090
my pic here ghosts of Tsushima this

131
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:17,360
comes out of nowhere it is basically

132
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,110
almost a historically accurate

133
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:26,419
open-world Japanese samurai ninjas yes

134
00:07:26,419 --> 00:07:28,850
it's about the mongolian invasion on one

135
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:31,130
of these smaller islands so it's can

136
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:34,070
tell a real nice isolated story with one

137
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:36,410
general coming in with his army and then

138
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:38,630
you tried to beat the insurgency i guess

139
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:41,120
and stop him and this is by I think

140
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,460
sucker-punch Studios which I never

141
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:46,729
really got into what is it the Sun of

142
00:07:46,729 --> 00:07:48,289
infamy our infamous you know the

143
00:07:48,289 --> 00:07:50,590
infamous series oh I was kind of playing

144
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:54,979
prototype at the time but uh but yeah if

145
00:07:54,979 --> 00:07:56,780
there was a solid foundation there but I

146
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:59,419
just wasn't into the universe this is

147
00:07:59,419 --> 00:08:02,060
what I was asking for in Assassin's

148
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,160
Creed you have to say it says his Creed

149
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,860
you take some notes and so we know not

150
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:09,229
fuck fuck them I don't need that game no

151
00:08:09,229 --> 00:08:11,090
more cuz I got it here open-world

152
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:14,690
Japanese RPG samurai armor ninjas all

153
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:16,130
that kind of stuff so I'm super excited

154
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:19,190
now again talking about stealth there's

155
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,720
probably gonna be stealth elements in

156
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,639
this game so we're gonna be the worst at

157
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,700
bad but it'll still be fun to play and

158
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,490
so yeah but honestly I think those of

159
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:30,650
Tsushima has the ability to tell a

160
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:32,959
really compelling story and be sort of

161
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:36,050
grant Red Dead Redemption in in Japan

162
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:38,000
you know kind of thing yes oh really

163
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:46,160
looking forward to number nine

166
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:55,790
in 11 okay yeah so this is not announced

167
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:58,550
we don't we don't know anything but

168
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:00,050
there's rumors that there's gonna be a

169
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:02,690
Mortal Kombat announcement it's about

170
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:07,100
right about that time yeah well it was

171
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,470
still still you know think what if there

172
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:11,090
isn't it's gonna be huge disappointment

173
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:14,540
I think and obviously I'm a huge Mortal

174
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,610
Kombat fan we've tried to review almost

175
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:19,100
all of them since our show's been out

176
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,650
and as you know we're working on a

177
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:24,020
Mortal Kombat miniatures game plug plug

178
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:26,150
plug so I don't know how this is gonna

179
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,680
affect that I'm like oh shit I gotta

180
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,500
throw my work away and restart with

181
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,000
these new characters but no it's

182
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,110
probably gonna take this game like a

183
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:35,150
year to to come out right so then we can

184
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:37,130
do like an expansion if they work

185
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:39,380
together so I'm gonna really try to find

186
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:42,140
ed over there and try to get an

187
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,760
interview or something and talk to him

188
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,830
about it what are we gonna do in the

189
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:47,210
Mortal Kombat universe because if it's

190
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:49,820
been rebooted you know and we're in like

191
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,130
this new alternate reality quan chi is

192
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:55,460
fucking dead you know scorpion has gone

193
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:58,160
through his inner demons already and

194
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,890
raisins evil now or something - oh no

195
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:04,520
Lou came and katana or like and for an

196
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,090
empress

197
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:06,920
bring it all so it's gonna be super

198
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,050
interesting what I'm wondering is are

199
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:11,270
they gonna go to the Armageddon cuz

200
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:12,470
there's been some Mortal Kombat games

201
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:15,670
where of like Dagon in fact you know

202
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:18,500
just names that nobody remembers you

203
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,270
know what I mean like what was that guy

204
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:23,000
is a riddle of Cobra or something like

205
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,280
that he's a ripoff and masters you

206
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,600
remember that he was like a karate

207
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,400
master anyway are we gonna see

208
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,530
Armageddon are they gonna do that and

209
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:32,600
bring in some characters or at least

210
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,290
like that Dragon King so excited for it

211
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:38,480
because we know nether realms knows how

212
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,350
to tell a story

213
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:43,430
the in fighting game and yeah so let's

214
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:44,960
see what they bring to the table with

215
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:48,080
Mortal Kombat

216
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:55,430
number eight

217
00:10:55,430 --> 00:11:09,010
[Music]

218
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:15,230
which they have to come out swinging at

219
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:17,360
this doesn't have that's why we put it

220
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,920
high up there because there's some

221
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,020
expectations and if you don't deliver on

222
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,420
these expectations and use and you you

223
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,400
show this wrong you know you're coming

224
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,960
off the battlefront micro it's not

225
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,550
transactions and so we're wondering how

226
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,950
does transactions factor into this is

227
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:36,020
their season pass are you going to be

228
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:39,290
screwing people over obviously it looks

229
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:41,300
like a destiny for me it looks like eh

230
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:44,270
destiny they want to do and I'm just

231
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:47,750
really surprised at how Bioware I'm kind

232
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,210
of dropping off exactly

233
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,660
everyone's like kind of jumping ship is

234
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:55,130
something we should be worried about

235
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:57,200
yeah Bioware we should we be worried

236
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,760
about you so this is like the game that

237
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,370
you have the opportunity to show us no

238
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:03,970
we're still Bioware we still kick ass

239
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:06,590
it's gonna be crazy just I don't know

240
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:09,320
like you see this guy jumping off and

241
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:13,460
and he's flying down but like is the

242
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,470
world really that open or are we gonna

243
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:18,350
have to fly that far back up every

244
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:20,600
single time is gonna be kind of annoying

245
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,550
to go back to this video I'm getting

246
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:25,430
some blue boxes it's easy to travel now

247
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:31,580
with these cool but but I there are some

248
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,200
fascinating elements to the world

249
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,270
they've got that walking robot that was

250
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:37,040
at the beginning and it's almost like a

251
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,660
giraffe looking thing

252
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:42,980
and yeah and I think that we seem to be

253
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,750
the colossus bigger

254
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:52,070
I hope there's way more than two yeah

255
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:55,240
I'm gonna be damage dealer and we'll see

256
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,460
so as long as the story is coherent

257
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:01,430
where destiny wasn't and the gameplay is

258
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:04,520
fun and the microtransactions aren't

259
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,370
built into the progression then I will

260
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:17,840
be interesting number seven coming in at

261
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,440
number seven is battlefield five I'm

262
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,840
super excited because I got to see three

263
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,690
hours of it before that sort of Trevor

264
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:29,720
Noah thing yeah yeah and and I'm and I

265
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,180
will be at EA plays and I will get

266
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:34,730
gameplay footage and that's gonna be the

267
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,920
real kicker is is it does it actually

268
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:40,280
feel like it looks for those three hours

269
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,640
and and and I will report to you guys

270
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,130
and I don't know if you know about do

271
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:47,270
you know some of the drama that was

272
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:49,850
going on where I'm starting to

273
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:51,440
understand a little bit more you know I

274
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,520
thought I thought it was just really

275
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,990
just all they were upset with the

276
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:55,790
there's a woman on the cover which there

277
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:58,040
are some weird kind of gray pose that

278
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,440
you know or that upset over that whether

279
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,300
like bark grandpa's memories is

280
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:06,500
completely fucked it was never intended

281
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,510
to be historically accurate they said

282
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:10,190
that in that three-hour sort of thing

283
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:12,380
that we're telling these untold stories

284
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:14,630
we're going a little bit different but

285
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,460
then the message got you mixed the

286
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,990
message got mixed because they did say

287
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,910
now historically hang a bit with the

288
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:21,560
tides of war mode

289
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,360
little more historical battles so they

290
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,550
want to do both and I really really

291
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:28,620
think that's an awesome idea because you

292
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,600
saw that trailer and here's where I'm

293
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,740
starting to think some people have a

294
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,440
point it's not all you know like weirdos

295
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,269
downloading the video it's some of them

296
00:14:36,269 --> 00:14:38,839
like legitimately like sort of the more

297
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:42,029
grounded and based realism that that has

298
00:14:42,029 --> 00:14:44,370
been in the battlefields and that tracer

299
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:45,930
looked like it was a Call of Duty

300
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:49,079
trailer yeah and a single-player Call of

301
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:50,790
Duty over-the-top that everything fallen

302
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:51,959
on the ground at there but it was

303
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:54,510
because then they said this they wanted

304
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,279
to show like each and every individual

305
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:57,720
element so each and every individual

306
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,459
element you saw something just randomly

307
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:00,990
towing something you saw like a plane

308
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:03,000
smaller there's new falling animations

309
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,769
for the plane all sorts of stuff like

310
00:15:04,769 --> 00:15:06,779
this that they try to jam pack in the

311
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:09,089
trailer so we'll see if it actually ends

312
00:15:09,089 --> 00:15:11,190
up being like a Call of Duty in it

313
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:13,380
single-player which isn't necessarily a

314
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:13,829
bad thing

315
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:15,930
why because Call of Duty this year has

316
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:18,540
no single player so they're you believe

317
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,910
that I know right so you get the best of

318
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:23,430
both worlds while still maintaining the

319
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:25,410
squad playing some of the realistic play

320
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:27,720
that we all know and love from

321
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,440
battlefield 5 so and honestly when and

322
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,170
they're evolving all their systems while

323
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:37,350
Call of Duty is basically following hot

324
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:40,620
trends and I really don't want Call of

325
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:43,769
Duty to outsell yeah I know and to

326
00:15:43,769 --> 00:15:46,290
reward that kind of behavior versus

327
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:50,579
battlefield it's like in profit right

328
00:15:50,579 --> 00:15:53,819
sky high this is why I have been

329
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:55,740
defending battlefield 5 against these

330
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,209
people and say wait so it comes out you

331
00:15:57,209 --> 00:15:58,769
know and if you and if you're one of

332
00:15:58,769 --> 00:16:01,019
those that absolutely do not want women

333
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:02,550
in the game at all

334
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,589
for whatever reason go play post

335
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:07,079
scriptum which is this really hyper

336
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:10,380
realistic it's super fun so check that

337
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,670
game

338
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:18,710
number six all right

339
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:21,230
so number six on my list is death

340
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:24,890
stranding okay this is Kojima course Shh

341
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:27,170
free from the shadows this is time to

342
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:29,330
shine it is time to shine with Sony

343
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:31,370
they're probably letting him run wild of

344
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:32,870
course they are because I've seen the

345
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:35,960
gentleman del Toro in a we've got Norman

346
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,770
Reedus from from The Walking Dead and

347
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:42,560
this game is crazy but I expect to see

348
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,720
some gameplay here because I still have

349
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,540
no fucking clue what this game is but I

350
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,970
have faith in him and I really think at

351
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:52,130
this point he's mixing in elements of

352
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:55,640
the silent pt remember how much related

353
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,430
entity I hope he mixes some elements

354
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:02,450
into that this game from PT and really

355
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:03,980
make it something interesting but it

356
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:06,980
looks it's just one of those fascinating

357
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:10,400
worlds from a bizarre mind that you want

358
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,360
to explore and we want to know more we

359
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,010
want to sing gameplay we want to see all

360
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:19,040
that kind of it's about it's about a

361
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:30,350
baby between life upside down and you

362
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,330
know everything Mads Mikkelsen in it

363
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:34,790
he's like always plays villains and

364
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:36,620
stuff so he's in it and then they were

365
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,590
talking about some sort of online

366
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,300
incorporation where maybe there's an

367
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,550
online element to it and people have to

368
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:45,650
work together on stuff to get things

369
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:47,330
accomplished which kind of sounds like

370
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:49,280
PT because remember how like everybody

371
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,600
had to work together to figure out that

372
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,520
what is in the game and like how

373
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,190
exploring different things are always

374
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:57,290
going on though i do think you could die

375
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:58,940
multiple times and you keep coming back

376
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:01,760
from that underwater world I don't know

377
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,610
tell us this is why we put this one on

378
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:06,500
the list so high because we want to know

379
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:11,100
more what the hell is the game shows

380
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:18,880
number five so number five you don't

381
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,670
tell me about this game I'm not sure

382
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:24,070
what it is but you said it's Bethesda

383
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,930
yeah they made great games

384
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:29,170
yes RPGs oh yeah a star-filled aren't

385
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:33,100
you yeah so so so I tease Joe with this

386
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,990
I was like hearing rumors of this

387
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:37,270
project called star field which is

388
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:40,030
Bethesda the same people that do you

389
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:42,280
know fallout with Joe really likes and

390
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:45,220
and Elder Scrolls it's not really like

391
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:48,580
in our opinion the best RPGs out there

392
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:51,880
and here's the thing so this one is a

393
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:55,300
sci-fi one rumored that you will be you

394
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:59,890
know exploring different planets I don't

395
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:02,380
know fallouts post-apocalyptic I have no

396
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:02,920
idea

397
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,650
here's the thing we don't know jack

398
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:07,900
about star field and I don't know jack

399
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:11,260
so that's why but the potential for this

400
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,780
one is so high and I think Bethesda this

401
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:16,960
year their showcase could potentially

402
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,500
beat Microsoft beat Sony meet Minnesota

403
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,720
cuz it I think I saw something is like

404
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,370
yeah we're working on the Elder Scrolls

405
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:27,520
6 that's later on but right now we're

406
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,520
working on - who said that oh that was

407
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,010
last year I think right don't tell me

408
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:35,050
they're not gonna do elders close this

409
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:38,200
they said it's still coming mid still a

410
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,420
while okay well as well

411
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:44,410
don't ruin my maybe maybe you okay I

412
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:45,610
said you say well maybe we'll get a

413
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:48,880
little bit of starfield teases to hold

414
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,640
people over until next year and we'll

415
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,860
get that okay we'll see we'll see

416
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:57,990
so starfield a sci-fi RPG from Bethesda

417
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:01,710
very exciting

418
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:14,170
number full what what whoa

419
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:37,620
[Music]

420
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:41,160
[Music]

421
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:45,130
number four beyond good and evil to Joe

422
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:47,890
so first I've never played the first one

423
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:50,140
I'll admit it so I'm coming in fresh I

424
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,610
don't care about the first one I know I

425
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:53,560
just move got a bunch of downloads

426
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:57,520
because I know it's a well blow yeah

427
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,650
well I know that was no easier trainer

428
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:01,630
buddy to get me excited in it and my

429
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:03,970
imagination ran wild like what kind of

430
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:05,800
game is this could you literally go to

431
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,380
different planets or it looked like

432
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:10,420
almost 5th element had that kind of feel

433
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:13,000
to it and and and like sort of he was

434
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,520
stealing off you know artifacts or

435
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,080
something I don't know and then their

436
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,970
spaceships and then you go to different

437
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:20,710
planets and there's treasure maps and

438
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:23,560
I'm like what the fuck no way and that

439
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,900
game could have been anything right but

440
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,940
uh but Joe you're the one that actually

441
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,830
you know showed me that game player you

442
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,660
pulled up a game play yeah and this

443
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:34,870
thing looks crazy guys if this it and

444
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:37,630
it's some of it's already working I mean

445
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,130
there's either got the little monkey

446
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:41,290
character flying around you've got a

447
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:43,900
ship you've got a smaller ship you can

448
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,000
store in your bigger shoes you could get

449
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,950
different ships all your crew is in

450
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:50,950
there and they and then he zooms out and

451
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:53,830
he zooms out in scale this fucking green

452
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:56,320
he puts the monkey on top of a statues

453
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,270
head and then he zooms out and he's in

454
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:01,300
fucking space and then he goes into

455
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,280
outer space and he goes back down and

456
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,050
there's like no loading and we're like

457
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:08,350
oh my god is this going to be no man's

458
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:09,040
sky

459
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:12,150
kind of

460
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:15,090
way better it looks way better and this

461
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:17,730
game is never coming out consider star

462
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:20,580
citizen it still is them out and and

463
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,200
you've got this game so I don't know

464
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,049
Ubisoft has the potential to just blow

465
00:22:25,049 --> 00:22:28,679
people away and and bring that next IP

466
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:30,840
that we love so much like Elder Scrolls

467
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:34,080
right and with this franchise yes it may

468
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,909
not look like the old beyond good and

469
00:22:35,909 --> 00:22:37,740
evil it may not share a whole lot of

470
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,510
stuff with that but I do think it does

471
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:42,539
try to pay homage or at least bring some

472
00:22:42,539 --> 00:22:44,279
of those elements in here but just in

473
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:46,710
this wide-open gun sort of galactic

474
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:49,409
setting and I'm just wondering can this

475
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:52,440
even work this there's a pirate crew

476
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,750
mm-hmm I know but this one's saying you

477
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:57,029
could be like it's like sea of thieves

478
00:22:57,029 --> 00:23:00,419
and no man's sky and then storytelling

479
00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:04,260
combined like a grand theft auto with a

480
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:08,970
ship and space and a monkey who tells

481
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:11,580
jokes so it's gonna be really

482
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,830
interesting guys and I and there's

483
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:16,500
picture-taking and you can share have

484
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,500
conversations with NPCs it just sounds

485
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,809
way too ambitious and I I just don't

486
00:23:21,809 --> 00:23:24,270
know if this game is gonna deliver so we

487
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:27,360
need to see and that was back in 2017

488
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,799
they showed the public that trailer

489
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,630
where nobody believed it but behind

490
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:32,130
closed doors they were showing an actual

one and and can they use that one to

498
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,740
compete with Bethesda cuz it looks like

499
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,690
but this is gonna be super strong this

500
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:54,240
year

501
00:23:54,240 --> 00:24:00,580
number three number three we have Elder

fallout Elder Scrolls fallout Elder

505
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,730
Scrolls will guess what no it's fallout

506
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:15,160
Elder Scrolls give it to us don't just

507
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,290
shut up do you think they can do like

508
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:20,410
kind of doing later and your your games

509
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:22,870
talking about which was star fields yeah

510
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:26,380
and then shows fallout 76 at star field

511
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:30,880
stay better not if in the in the same

512
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,660
showcase show it in the same showcase

513
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:36,250
well it would be a disappointment if

514
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,650
they don't at least mention it or talk

515
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:41,620
about it they have to and I wouldn't get

516
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:46,810
up and I would leave yeah no all right

517
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:49,090
right okay so listen for me at the end

518
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:50,980
what about all the scrolls

519
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,300
well I know what they're gonna do

520
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,770
they're gonna show up coming they're

521
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:56,890
gonna show a new expansion for the MMO

522
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:59,410
which I here's a lot better but frankly

523
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:00,820
I'm tired of it I wanna I want elder

524
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:03,430
school then what main like I want to

525
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:04,750
return to that world

526
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:08,080
from the studio that I know and like and

527
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,610
yes you can return the world right now

528
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:11,950
with the MMO and that's great and like I

529
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:13,660
said I think but this is gonna have a

530
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:16,680
killer show this year it's big show

531
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:22,480
fallout 76 and Stark Hewitt and like

532
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,020
doom 2 and rage 2 which they have and

533
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:29,710
DLC for something and then reflect I

534
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:32,940
think this prey DLC and then end it with

535
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:37,300
Skyrim or Elder Scrolls 6 that would we

536
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:40,900
lose that would limit that would win the

537
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,880
whole show so we don't know shit about

538
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,400
Elder Scrolls 6 other than it's gonna be

539
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,710

555
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,280
Dead Redemption - huge huge fan of the

556
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:58,330
original in Florida it was like I can't

557
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:00,490
wait till they do Western open world

558
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:02,320
rila Grand Theft Auto here comes

559
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,510
Rockstar not only do they deliver that

560
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:07,180
but it is amazing it has an amazing

561
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:10,870
story it has amazing sidequest it has

562
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:13,960
diamonds their dynamic storytelling it

563
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:19,180
had a great DLC it had multiplayer it

564
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:21,550
and multi and this I was gonna give it a

565
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:23,620
9 or a 10 without multiplayer and then

566
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:26,740
they did multiplayer so wow it was

567
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,420
amazing and then they went on to do

568
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:30,370
Grand Theft Auto 5 which was also

569
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:32,710
amazing and but then they did the

570
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:34,450
monetization on Grand Theft Auto online

571
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:37,240
and then you know and then we're

572
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,360
starting to be like man start like

573
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,400
getting some antique piano practices

574
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,770
what's happening with these shark cards

575
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:46,900
or whatever they were calling those is

576
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,970
that gonna seep into Red Dead Redemption

577
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:53,830
to the online component but here's the

578
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:55,510
greatest thing is I know I know that

579
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:57,520
they have the integrity to keep that

580
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,160
shit out of the single-player so at bare

581
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,810
minimum if you're worried about that you

582
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:03,640
just play the single-player right and

583
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,530
it'd be an amazing story and hopefully

584
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:07,120
they'll have just as good side quests

585
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,880
they'll have dynamic stuff and it'll

586
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,410
tell a great story but can it really

587
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:13,720
tell a good story without John Morrison

588
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,850
we're not jungle and we're following

589
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:18,040
what is it

590
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,970
yeah I don't know yeah basically it's

591
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:23,950
the West is pretty much already all I

592
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:25,600
know and that's another thing is like I

593
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,400
just the glory days of the West Coast

594
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:32,200
Swing it's done down so it's gonna be a

595
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,200
swan song and it's gonna be bittersweet

596
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,770
to see this age and and us to go down in

597
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:40,210
a hail of gunfire

598
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:42,040
ya know but oh man I can't wait though

599
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,800
if we could like do julene Italy you

600
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,500
said it's gonna be better Mechanics for

601
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:51,130
the gunplay and customized you could

602
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:53,650
customize weapon oh and of course the

603
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:55,090
graphics are gonna be better even though

604
00:28:55,090 --> 00:29:01,300
the graphics were already but but if the

605
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:04,810
graph is a little rough yeah something's

606
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:07,360
gonna hold me over yeah but it's it's

607
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,010
we're super excited for Red Dead

608
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:10,960
Redemption to we're hoping that they

609
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,150
show gameplay we've seen the story

610
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:15,670
trailers we've seen this we want and

611
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:17,590

636
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:51,870
they're not gonna micro transaction you

637
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:53,250
to death they're not gonna tie that to

638
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:55,770
progression they're going to give you a

639
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:59,159
substantial DLC and expansions if they

640
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:01,409
do them and that kind of stuff and for

641
00:31:01,409 --> 00:31:04,220
them to be the caretakers of this

642
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:07,529
cyberpunk world I'm so happy because

643
00:31:07,529 --> 00:31:10,799
it's a lot of the work is already done

644
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:13,320
for them because of the author of

645
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,980
cyberpunk and the RPGs so they don't

646
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:20,279
need to spend all this time creating

647
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:22,830
these things they can spend time

648
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:25,409
refining the things bringing them to

649
00:31:25,409 --> 00:31:29,820
life improving on this yeah and you know

650
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,950
the detail that these guys really and

651
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:33,690
they care and they love their games and

652
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:35,760
but we really don't know what it is

653
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,279
other than it's an RPG is it going to

654
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:40,500
feel like Witcher is there going to be a

655
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:44,220
narrator team oh yeah it are we that

656
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:46,140
lady in the trailer that has the

657
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:48,029
augments on our eyes are sort of like

658
00:31:48,029 --> 00:31:50,010
spider that come out and maybe she Sue's

659
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:52,049
military you know robot and then they've

660
00:31:52,049 --> 00:31:54,059
caught her and police are shooting at

661
00:31:54,059 --> 00:31:57,630
her and shit or are we a police officer

662
00:31:57,630 --> 00:32:00,210
flying around in this you know laid

663
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:01,890
runner yeah we're gonna find these

664
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:03,960
deviants or do you just create your own

665
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,520
character it's gotta be creating your

666
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,659
own character and now that I think about

667
00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:07,020
it

668
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:10,710
right cuz Garret was great a Rivia right

669
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:12,840
and it made the game better because we

670
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,549
really liked him but I still I just

671
00:32:14,549 --> 00:32:17,640
wanted to make my own character and I

672
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,409
think we're finally gonna get that here

673
00:32:19,409 --> 00:32:21,870
and I hope that they show us more of the

674
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:23,010
character customization because they

675
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:24,899
have sand and now I'm remembering it's

676
00:32:24,899 --> 00:32:27,870
coming back to me you know and I hope

677
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:30,360
that they show substantially some

678
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,580
gameplay this time I want it on the

679
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:38,520

forth between those halls so let me know

707
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:43,559
what you want to know which games you

708
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:45,360
want to see interviews for all that

709
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,029
stuff and I'm just so excited because I

710
00:33:48,029 --> 00:33:50,850
think this III feels to me way more

711
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:54,179
exciting than the last newsroom the game

712
00:33:54,179 --> 00:33:59,279
I mean and and I really and as man I'm

713
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,049
gonna be talking about Microsoft at the

714
00:34:01,049 --> 00:34:03,509
YouTube live at e3 with Geoff Keighley

715
00:34:03,509 --> 00:34:06,240
but if Microsoft really needs to bring

716
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:15,089
in this year yes the technical specs the

717
00:34:15,089 --> 00:34:17,460
most powerful console ever those are all

718
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,260
great things but if you don't have the

719
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,510
games to back it up nobody's gonna care

720
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:24,480
who's gonna care is the best way to play

721
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,819
the best way to play what I've got all

722
00:34:26,819 --> 00:34:29,490
the multi-platform games and exclusives

723
00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:32,190
over on the sunny side and we don't want

724
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:34,109
Microsoft to fall behind we really don't

725
00:34:34,109 --> 00:34:36,869
because competition creates all these

726
00:34:36,869 --> 00:34:39,450
creates that sense of urgency for Sony

727
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:43,200
to do this so Microsoft wake up please

728
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,329
don't let it just be halo 6 and Gears of

729
00:34:45,329 --> 00:34:47,429
War 7 or whatever

730
00:34:47,429 --> 00:34:50,010
