here for his own thing and that's

19
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:07,300
something we haven't talked about yet on

20
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,610
the vlog today seemed like a perfect day

21
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:13,330
because Dan is gonna try to be he's not

22
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:15,580
gonna try Dan is going to be making a

23
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:18,610
video for his main channel today I'm

24
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:20,800
gonna be assisting him that felt like

25
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,280
the perfect opportunity to I don't know

26
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,290
kind of explain who Dan is and what Dan

27
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:31,479
does a little bit better do I say

28
00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:34,030
something not whoa Dan what were you

29
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:37,360
doing in South Africa before you moved

30
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,210
to New York City I would direct TV

31
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:43,509
commercials what was your favorite brand

32
00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:45,610
you made a commercial for um it's not

33
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:46,900
necessarily about the brand it's

34
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,130
probably more about the commercial

35
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:50,410
itself which was a job I did for Tosca

36
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:54,100
Naga in Kenya I'm Dan Mays film director

37
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,200
from Cape Town we've just wrapped up the

38
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:02,470
TV commercial and short form for tasks

39
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:05,149
did you like being a commercial director

40
00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:07,070
in the beginning when I came into it I

41
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,899
really believe that that was what I

42
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:10,640
wanted to do I thought that commercial

43
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,790
film directing was my was the be-all and

44
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:15,890
end-all for me I got to be on big sets

45
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:18,819
have big crews work with lots of money

46
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:21,860
but then eventually my ideas started but

47
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,310
my ideas started to become watered down

48
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,380
it started to become about a lot more

49
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,480
than just the concept of filmmaking

50
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,170
I just felt that the true essence of

51
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,540
what filmmaking means to me was stripped

52
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:38,810
away and I started to forget about why

53
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:41,360
it is that I make phones so what does

54
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,610
this movie today we're making today

55
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:45,560
today I'm basically exploiting you and

56
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:53,420
your channel to get me loads of fun Stan

57
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,459
is downstairs waiting for me right now

58
00:02:55,459 --> 00:03:00,319
no joke I am truly genuinely nervous to

59
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,630
be assisting him because like when we're

60
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,730
shooting it's my video he's so good at

61
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:09,170
backing me up and I am not good at

62
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:11,150
assisting someone teaches I'm like

63
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,739
because I'm always trying to impart my

64
00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:15,489
ways on their shoe hey pardon me guys

65
00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:18,560
dude do you want to see do you want to

66
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,239
see how good of an assistant I am yes

67
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:27,350
you forgot the memory card shit okay

68
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:28,950
first team

69
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:30,780
I'm gonna get you to do this three times

70
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,700
I'm gonna take a couple to either gonna

71
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,230
walk pass to the time body there'll be

72
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,870
two of you yet it's as simple as that

73
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:42,000
and I I make films because I have not

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,510
learned anything else and I know I can

75
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:51,239
do it to a certain degree and it is my

76
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:58,950
duty one of my favorite filmmakers

77
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:02,489
Verner Herzog has 24 rules of filmmaking

78
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:04,620

79
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,049

81
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,850

97
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,570
night in jail if it means getting the

98
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:03,139
shot you need food

99
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:19,830

101
00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:26,580
intelligence yeah yeah today's today's

102
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,159
video is is about that it's about my

103
00:05:29,159 --> 00:05:32,310
journey as a film director where I'm not

104
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:34,979
where I've come from and how why I've

105
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:36,780
decided to make the step in my career

106
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,370
that sounds boring you should make it

107
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:40,400
sound more interesting for the people

108
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,440
number five learn to live with your

109
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:49,560
mistakes I've lost I've lost my script

110
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,770
I'm stressing out man it is so much

111
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,990
easier to be directed by someone else

112
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:57,300
than have to direct someone else Dan

113
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,000
you're doing a great job - in total

114

to be that double the amount of subs is

166
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,189
yeah that's totally doing it totally

167
00:08:45,189 --> 00:08:48,279
doable Oh to be honest I would want to

168
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:50,410
be living on the space of YouTube

169
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:53,290
creating content that that people want

170
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:55,329
to watch and the content that makes me

171
00:08:55,329 --> 00:08:55,990
happy

172
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:57,819
essentially that's not like I said

173
00:08:57,819 --> 00:09:00,480
that's the goal the dream is to be like

174
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,459
filmmaking for me is so much more than

175
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:07,269
making phones so we're fully done how do

176
00:09:07,269 --> 00:09:09,750
you think it went

177
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:13,689
it's it's tough like time like what you

178
00:09:13,689 --> 00:09:15,519
wish what you've been teaching me about

179
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,410
time management that's where I really

180
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:21,220
need to learn and focus on stop trying

181
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:25,959
to make things perfect so after doing 30

182
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:28,240
what we've made 31 videos you've watched

183
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,040
me make you've helped me make 31 videos

184
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,740
in like the last month what's it like

185
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:35,230
making your first video in the shadow of

186
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:40,139
like that absolutely insane manic pace

187
00:09:40,139 --> 00:09:43,930
for today I fully understand why you so

188
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:48,279
hardcore like I don't know like to be

189
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:50,589
honest I'm a part of your videos every

190
00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:52,959
day but because I'm not directing and

191
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,509
they're not my videos I'm kind of taking

192
00:09:55,509 --> 00:09:57,879
direction from you and when I you know

193
00:09:57,879 --> 00:10:00,569
to be a part of the whole idea

194
00:10:00,569 --> 00:10:02,980
consistently like working on it is very

195
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,680
difficult thing to do

196
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,839
you know so like I admire you for hey

197
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:12,720
