1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:05,779
this is this is the first time

2
00:00:05,779 --> 00:00:08,330
honestly literally I've logged into

3
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:14,210
Minecraft in months it has been months

4
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:18,289
it's been a long time and honestly I

5
00:00:18,289 --> 00:00:22,920
have no on my arm piece of

6
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,260
chocolate figures I have no frickin idea

7
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:31,099
what this is what is this login screen

8
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:34,980
I'm not used to it so welcome guys to

9
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,440
another video today I thought I'd be

10
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,530
doing something a little nostalgic but

11
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:43,079
different first time logging into

12
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,789
minecraft in months and and yeah this is

13
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:50,160
definitely a lot different I have no

14
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,140
idea what this login screen is it's so

15
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,940
foreign to me a couple things before we

16
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,960
get started is my my original account

17
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,480
got hacked it got hacked really bad and

18
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,810
I have tried recovering it and I have

19
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,299
yet to get it so I had to make a new

20
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:12,150
accounts I had to get a new account

21
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,490
because my capes my everything they're

22
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:18,180
gone they're gone somebody hacked it so

23
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,890
bad the change sort of got the email

24
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:21,630
somehow change the security questions I

25
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:22,920
don't know what the hell happened but

26
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,619
it's gone but whatever just got a new

27
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:28,290
account that mean too much so we're

28
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:34,680
going to hit play and I seriously this

29
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,520
is this new login screen is really kind

30
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,320
of stupid in my opinion it looks pretty

31
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,040
stupid looks like I'm about to like get

32
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,119
a virus I'm pretty confused I'm not

33
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:51,000
going to lie I'm be honest at least they

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,009
didn't change this this this is still

35
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:58,469
looking pretty good yeah there we go

36
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:01,320
there we go this is still looking pretty

37
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:06,000
good it's the same the same but what do

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,160
people do in Minecraft nowadays what's I

39
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,860
mean I have been on and so long what's

40
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,920
is it like mine flex

41
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,989
is that what it is mind flex I haven't

42
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:21,510
been on I really have not been on in so

43
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:25,980
long it's it's crazy stupid that the

44
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,700
last time I was actually on it's been a

45
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,370
long time because you know I recorded

46
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:34,500
some videos on the other channel but

47
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,780
those were actually pre-recorded you

48
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,400
know before I even launched that channel

49
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,190
so it's it's kind of foreign to me like

50
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,750
I don't even know what that launcher was

51
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:49,860
all about but this this right here this

52
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,040
right here is pretty nostalgic at least

53
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,650
I have my skin at least I have my skin I

54
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:57,780

83
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:16,829

84
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:20,489
maybe doing minecraft content on my

85
00:04:20,489 --> 00:04:22,789
second channel deadlocks vs. gaming and

86
00:04:22,789 --> 00:04:24,810
leaving this channel

87
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:28,770
you know real life but I wanted to kind

88
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:31,770

god oh my god oh I lived I freakin lived

98
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,160
I can't believe I lived that's crazy

99
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,680
see when I used to do minecraft it's

100
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,060
like you know doing these minigames that

101
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,680
are so fun back in the day

102
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,000
just these games going going hanging out

103
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,830
on skype with just a bunch of buddies

104
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:16,830
and just just chilling like villains

105
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:19,080
doing little mini games like this back

106
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,190
in the day you know this game was

107
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:22,290
honestly so fun I don't know what

108
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:24,750
changed for me I mean I honestly think I

109
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,410
could still have fun but it's like I'd

110
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:31,020
have to I don't know it's like I'd

111
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,760
almost have to just do it myself just

112
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:36,930
because it's just I've had such such an

113
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:41,850
odd I died such an odd experience with

114
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:44,510
the Minecraft community and people it's

115
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:48,180
like I know I was one of those people

116
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,660
who screw huge off minecraft helped mold

117
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:56,340
the community and just you know just did

118
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:59,789
what I did and it was like you know such

119
00:05:59,789 --> 00:06:02,100
a huge thing such a fun time such a

120
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,750
simple thing because it's like you know

121
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,280
even now I love doing real life videos

122
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,590
sometimes it's hard to think of ideas oh

123
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,300
that's pretty neat

124
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,910
but it's you know minecraft you could

125
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:14,070
just get in and just record a quick

126
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:16,440
video edit upload boom you're done

127
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,850
because there's just like so many games

128
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:21,810
but you know I just this is literally

129
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:23,190
the first time I've been on in a while

130
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:24,930
I'm just kind I'm really getting used to

131
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,970
it I know a lot of you guys might be

132
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:31,470
enjoying me actually being on this look

133
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:34,320
at the freaking fish holy that's

134
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:34,860
cool

135
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:38,060
oh my god that's freaking awesome

136
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,530
but I got to take a screenshot of that

137
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:43,220
that is cool I don't know guys I really

138
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,930
don't know I have such mixed feelings

139
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:48,730
right like just about this it's crazy I

140
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:51,560
I know it's like my commentary right now

141
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,290
is kind of off and I'm kind of just like

142
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:57,560
blabbing jabbering but it's just feel

143
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,510
feels weird to actually log in back on

144
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:01,040
minecraft I never thought I'd actually

145
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,290
download it again I was you know

146
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:07,180
honestly pretty butthurt but you know I

147
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:10,310
it's just being back on and just seeing

148
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:12,500
all this stuff getting back into the

149
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,050
game it kind of feels interesting it

150
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:17,860
feels definitely feels interesting I

151
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:20,960
kind of like the the break I took from

152
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,440
it to be honest because it honestly

153
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,200
doesn't feel forced it feels fresh kind

154
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:31,190
of almost refreshing playing this just

155
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:33,590
playing this it's probably not a good

156
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:38,330
idea to be on this that ship but it's

157
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,250
like I'm totally just thinking about

158
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:43,100
making double X versus gaming like how

159
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,560
it was way back in the day calm down

160
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,510
what you think guys calm down what you

161
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,560
think I'm probably going to put a little

162
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,120
disclaimer in the beginning of this

163
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,390
video a some might basically just some

164
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:57,289
this video up in the beginning just

165
00:07:57,289 --> 00:07:58,460
because there's a lot of blabbering

166
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:01,460
going on I'm just kind of just kind of

167
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,380
like wow just more floored I just

168
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,169
haven't even logged in in a long time

169
00:08:05,169 --> 00:08:09,500
pretty fluid about that it's kind of

170
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,500
crazy to be honest it's crazy almost a

171
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,380
little bit depressing but like

172
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:17,600
depressing as a nostalgic like you

173
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,370
missed something you wish you could you

174
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:21,830
know be that way but you know I don't

175
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,240
think it could ever be the way it could

176
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,729
be but I think I could definitely almost

177
00:08:25,729 --> 00:08:28,400
build and mold something like how it was

178
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,180
in the past

179
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,639
on the blocks versus gaming but I don't

180
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:33,800
know but look you guys should let me

181
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,020
know about that because you know this is

182
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,360

183
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,659
