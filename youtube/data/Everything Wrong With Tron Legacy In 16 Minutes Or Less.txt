1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:11,370
the grid the narration um bom bom

2
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:16,199
bom-bom Tron roll it cycles Pyrenees

3
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:19,680
disk battles fun spectacular arenas and

4
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,380
cycles that raced on ribbons of light

5
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,930
well spectacular was 1982 computer and

6
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,460
backlit animation would laugh and I

7
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,349
called him hmm

8
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:31,109
well avatar you created an avatar also

9
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:32,550
this exposition works perfectly as a

10
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:34,110
bedtime story because it's guaranteed to

11
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,309
put us all to sleep that'll have to

12
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:36,960
learn the next time you're good with

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,629
waiting twenty years right always on the

14
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:42,180
same team whoa creepy CG unification

15
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,710
alert I guess even bridges can't span

16
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,930
the uncanny valley and come CEO and

17
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:48,239
video game icon Kevin Flynn has

18
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:49,980
disappeared good grief is this entire

19
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,690
movie exposition not even five minutes

20
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:53,489
in and we follow a full minute of

21
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:55,140
bedtime story with another full two

22
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,670
minutes of television ghosts graveyard

23
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,230
news broadcasts to jam even more

24
00:00:58,230 --> 00:00:59,969
knowledge into your brain space he was

25
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:02,190
best known for designing frog and space

26
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:04,199
paranoids the two best-selling video

27
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:06,330
games in history clearly coolspot

28
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:07,950
did not exist in this universe the

29
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,630
future of end time will most likely

30
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,580
depend on what becomes of this now

31
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,040
orphaned little boy now orphaned

32
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:14,760
seriously

33
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,200
I know news reporters can be harsh but

34
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,030
Jesus and it's not he's Annie living the

35
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:19,290
hard-knock life he's sitting on a

36
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:20,759
fortune and probably being spoiled by

37
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:22,920
his grandparents also income has a board

38
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,390
of directors who can make all the hard

39
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:25,799
decisions over the years it takes young

40
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:27,360
Sam to grow into Country Strong this

41
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,530
isn't the first company who's lost at

42
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:29,850
CEO and had to function in this way

43
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:31,320
didn't this movie see Batman Begins

44
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,909
luckily for Sam and the camera operator

45
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:34,619
these cars are perfectly spaced for Sam

46
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:38,700
to bob and weave his motorcycle through

47
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,469
is it too soon to take a cent off for

48
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:42,180
this incredible Daft Punk score cuz

49
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,579
sweet dad this is good stuff now that is

50
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:46,680
a big door indeed and if the entrance to

51
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,060
the tower is worth protecting with that

52
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,679
big a door shouldn't there also be video

53
00:01:49,679 --> 00:01:56,369
surveillance this works so only the

54
00:01:56,369 --> 00:01:57,840
third floor had a camera in the stairs

55
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,549
where's the logic in that also I don't

56
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:00,720
care if Sam's been hitting Planet

57
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,069
Fitness for years there's no way he's

58
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:03,840
still going that fast after 60 flights

59
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,640
of stairs and jeans a leather jacket and

60
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,469
wearing a parachute backpack sure comes

61
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:09,840
as no surprise who we had to thank a man

62
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,290
whose fathers own notable history with

63
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:15,720
income helped make this company what it

64
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,200
is today

65
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,000
Edward Dillinger actually this should

66
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,890
come as a huge surprise when Flynn went

67
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,269
AWOL I'm sure they had to scramble and

68
00:02:21,269 --> 00:02:22,560
get some new blood in to make sure the

69
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,849
company didn't flounder but they got

70
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:25,230
back in bed with a Dillinger family

71
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:26,579
daddy Dillinger was the guy who only had

72
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:28,110
his job because he ripped off Flynn and

73
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,519
then almost brought the company down

74
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:31,410
with this MC people there weren't any

75
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:32,970
capable software engineers available

76
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:34,230
that didn't have such shady connections

77
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,180
also movie we see perfectly good Killian

78
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,980
Murphy by not making him the bad guy or

79
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,420
even having him in the rest of the movie

80
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,730
given the prices that we charge to

81
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:44,370
students fan this dude discount Michael

82
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,959
Douglas's so hard that I had to look

83
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:48,420
that up to confirm it's not him OS 12 is

84
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,400
the most secure operating system ever

85
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,989
released the idea of sharing our

86
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:54,329
software or giving it away for free

87
00:02:54,329 --> 00:02:56,730
disappeared with Kevin Flynn man we're

88
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,200
able to squeeze a massive amount of

89
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,760
condescending dickish Ness into one

90
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,109
scene where are you gonna write through

91
00:03:01,109 --> 00:03:03,450
now hey you don't want to do that

92
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:04,829
especially considering you were right

93
00:03:04,829 --> 00:03:06,239
when you said he had nowhere to run the

94
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,889
security guards balance beam routine is

95
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:09,900
not only unlikely and unsafe it's

96
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:14,770
completely unnecessary

97
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:16,880
what kind of psychopath is driving this

98
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,680
taxi if someone lands on your vehicle

99
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,450
for any reason who speeds up and drives

100
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,590
like a bat out of hell

101
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,540
also this might take place in 2010 but

102
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,160
it sure as hell feels like it's using

103
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,540
cab drivers from 1982

104
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,940
your message to the board was very

105
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:33,170
clever yeah this actually seems

106
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:34,820
plausible considering the dog is smart

107
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:35,990
enough to unwrap the burger before

108
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:37,340
eating it instead of digging right in

109
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,260
even though this area of town is super

110
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,940
rundown and abandoned all these years

111
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,260
later you're gonna tell me that no one

112
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,940
ever sold or looted these arcade

113
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:47,810
machines and they still work both movies

114
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,400
tell us that these are the best and most

115
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,080
sophisticated computer systems ever but

116
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,130
they can't immediately tell the

117
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:53,450
difference between a user and a program

118
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,130
digital upskirting what's up with the

119
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:56,630
weather in the grid I realize we have to

120
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,250
be darkened downward but the sane LA and

121
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,510
Blade Runner it's a completely digital

122
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:01,280
fabrication and has no need for storms

123
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,990
why are these Fembots just staring and

124
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:04,190
waiting is there a line in their code

125
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:09,950
that programs for maximum creepiness man

126
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,570
sure was nice of Sam's opponent to wait

127
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:13,190
attack until after Sam was able to see

128
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,840
that expositional delecia they're polite

129
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,580
but firm in this universe what reason is

130
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,169
given that Sam is so goddamn good at

131
00:04:18,169 --> 00:04:20,180
video games at least 1982 Tron had a

132
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,709
scene where Flynn beats the high score

133
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:23,510
on a game all we've seen Sam do is some

134
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:24,800
computer hacking BASE jumping and

135
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,300
motorcycle hijinks Inc the scene no

136
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,350
matter how cool it may be it's

137
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,210
definitely not earned Sam is a disc to

138
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:30,950
glass floors I feel like I just got

139
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:33,169
downtime why do I feel like Sam wouldn't

140
00:04:33,169 --> 00:04:34,669
last two goddamn seconds in this game

141
00:04:34,669 --> 00:04:36,380
considering he's not only an experienced

142
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,880
in it he's never been in the fucking

143
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,540
grid at all

144
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,100
the Curious Case of Benjamin bridges

145
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,440
what do you do same thing I'm going to

146
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,560
do to you

147
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,889
that's racist what exactly is this crowd

148
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:49,419
is there an upper and lower middle class

149
00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:50,710
in the grid that scrounges to gather

150
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,509
enough cash to finally take the family

151
00:04:52,509 --> 00:04:54,370
to the big game is tailgating involved I

152
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:55,900
mean that's the movie I'd rather see

153
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,360
excellent words sir the crowd seemed

154
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,360
quiet energized it wasn't meant for them

155
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,830
it was obviously meant for the movie

156
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,479
audience because this movie is much more

157
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,009
interested in boring exposition than

158
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:07,840
actual droning now this second deal

159
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,310
because he rides a motorcycle in the

160
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,259
real world we saw him hop one goddamn

161
00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:13,030
interstate ramp earlier not competing to

162
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:17,919
death race involving toxic chemicals but

163
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,210
don't actually discuss the plan

164
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:20,979
just nod split off and hope for the best

165
00:05:20,979 --> 00:05:22,509
aya Sam still holding on to this light

166
00:05:22,509 --> 00:05:24,669
cycle baton if his now D resolved friend

167
00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:25,720
had already grabbed it shouldn't have

168
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,169
let go

169
00:05:26,169 --> 00:05:27,340
or was he planning on dragging him

170
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,750
around by the arm how did Sam get his

171
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,400
disk back clewd took it from him back at

172
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,960
the control room did Ron just hand that

173
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,949
back over to him and who needs to

174
00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:37,449
upgrade to some better grid security

175
00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:44,050
how did cor even get near here yeah but

176
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:45,460
you could easily answer that one like

177
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,930
just saying to meet someone would

178
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,120
probably be sufficient dinner soon we'll

179
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,250
talk then you can make actual food here

180
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,139
how's that possible why is that possible

181
00:05:53,139 --> 00:05:55,389
- spectacular how the hell did they

182
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:56,650
adjourn to the sing room not only

183
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:58,659
mid-story but practically mid-sentence

184
00:05:58,659 --> 00:06:00,699
the possibilities of their route code

185
00:06:00,699 --> 00:06:03,820
their digital DNA disease history

186
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,130
science philosophy the screenwriters are

187
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:07,570
clearly feeding Jeff ridges random

188
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:09,099
dictionary words to see which ones he

189
00:06:09,099 --> 00:06:10,780
can make sound most lebowski in bio

190
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:13,539
digital jazz man nice try dude but

191
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,159
people don't even know what regular jazz

192
00:06:15,159 --> 00:06:16,750
is so your presentations falling on deaf

193
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:19,719
ears the ISOs we're gonna be my gift to

194
00:06:19,719 --> 00:06:21,880
the world and movies back to expositor

195
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,289
again I swear there's more this movie

196
00:06:23,289 --> 00:06:24,969
told us exposition then actually shown

197
00:06:24,969 --> 00:06:26,710
as part of the story so what happened

198
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:29,349
clue in the foyer with a candlestick I

199
00:06:29,349 --> 00:06:31,060
tried to get back but I couldn't get to

200
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:33,310
the portal it uses massive power and it

201
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,630
can't stay open forever

202
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,039
it can only be open from the outside

203
00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:37,870
that seems like pretty important

204
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,280
knowledge maybe you share it with at

205
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,479
least one other person on the outside

206
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,219
like Alan so you never get trapped in

207
00:06:42,219 --> 00:06:43,990
your own system with my disk it's

208
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:46,750
possible and then one game over the guy

209
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,120
doesn't dig imperfection but how even

210
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,530
though he's got a bunch of minions lined

211
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:52,060
up now is he for sure we're gonna take

212
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,469
over the world it's a decent army but

213
00:06:53,469 --> 00:06:55,659
it's not even the size of like the NYPD

214
00:06:55,659 --> 00:06:56,260
helmet

215
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,180
brought you here through the grid um

216
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,220
Disney's prime directive is to cash in

217
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,960
on every last drop of nostalgia juice I

218
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,650
said it was clue clue set that page

219
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:07,000
that's why you're here

220
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,590
the more they try and use this page as

221
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:10,240
the inciting incident the less sense it

222
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:10,600
makes

223
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,400
how did clue even have Allen's number to

224
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,960
get a call-out to the pager how did clue

225
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,430
know Allen and or Sam would even

226
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:16,960
investigate or figure out how to get in

227
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,380
the game

228
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,300
how did clue even know what a pager is

229
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,860
am I good stone yeah that you don't want

230
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,330
to be stuck in this place for eternity

231
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:24,010
either that's quite a good instinct

232
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,690
considering wyldstyle here hasn't even

233
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:27,460
spoken once yet about what she wants or

234
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,900
who she even is he's basing this leap

235
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,880
solely because she loves jewels burn if

236
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,840
there's one thing that movies have

237
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,430
taught us it's that when introspection

238
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:34,780
time comes they're sure to be a nearby

239
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,310
mirror

240
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:38,050
this is his sector and no other

241
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:39,820
information man I hope there's a foxy

242
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,200
character that has somehow I met Sam

243
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,550
earlier today that'll guide him to the

244
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:44,470
right place also there's so much in this

245
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:46,210
movie that's only partially explained

246
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:47,500
like there are discs on their back that

247
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,390
are apparently both weapon and ID chips

248
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,770
but what exactly do they do all I know

249
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,330
is that it made Sam's eyes flash blue

250
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:53,680
when he put it on about a half hour ago

251
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,030
and he hasn't even asked anyone why

252
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:59,290
since look I know we need to get

253
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:00,610
everyone in place for the finale but

254
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:02,770
Holi does this movie throw the shoots on

255
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:04,270
any momentum it had during the second

256
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:06,040
act movie prompts the sudden realization

257
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,360
that I never wanted to have sex with

258
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,010
multiple simulated programs until just

259
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:10,510
now and what a couple punks

260
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:16,060
the son of innumerable possibilities he

261
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,250
has to walk into mine why does everyone

262
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,990
know Sam exists it Flynn's biggest

263
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,550
concern and reason he's still here is

264
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:22,960
because he didn't want clue getting out

265
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,980
then why would he give away any

266
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,360
knowledge of his business or familial

267
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,160
ties in the outside world also what

268
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,630
purpose did Castro serve in the original

269
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,100
game was it like Grand Theft Auto where

270
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,540
instead of playing with disks or light

271
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:32,860
cycles you could just pick up hookers

272
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:38,890
and casters club libations libations and

273
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:40,090
for everybody vibrations are

274
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:41,740
specifically drinks for deity and gods

275
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,450
maybe I could see why they would look at

276
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:44,740
Sam in this light but whomever the

277
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,690
equivalent of casters norm is can just

278
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:49,650
stick to the cold Coors Light thank you

279
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:52,480
y'all host between this Twilight and

280
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,830
passengers it's clear Michael Sheen

281
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:55,510
could make a good living just stealing

282
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:57,160
the thought of middling sci-fi movies

283
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:01,090
that star pretty people thank you my

284
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:02,470
name is Johnny you know what's truly

285
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:04,150
outrageous Jim that despite being told

286
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:06,130
how dangerous the grid is Flynn jr. just

287
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:07,600
keeps trusting every program he comes in

288
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,250
contact with main antagonist and his

289
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,120
posse systematic

290
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,410
position to look more badass when

291
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:14,740
appearing on the scene cliche okay who

292
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:15,850
made the decision for trying to be

293
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:17,470
turned into a growling man beast

294
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:18,730
what did clue even do to him to make

295
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:24,760
this happen King Jarvis metal apples the

296
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,770
go-to fruit of digital assholes grid

297
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:31,089
why'd you our clue I am clue you will

298
00:09:31,089 --> 00:09:33,520
create the perfect system I will create

299
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,660
the perfect system

300
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,670
bing-bang-boom also no wonder this

301
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:37,960
didn't work out well Lin yadda yadda

302
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,760
through the important worse than John

303
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,830
Hammond after the Pudge I needed to

304
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:44,350
reinvent myself I guess all the Uncle

305
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,029
Sam creepy skeleton and neon horror

306
00:09:46,029 --> 00:09:48,310
masks were taken so castor Zeus went for

307
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:50,020
an Alpina look but we're not here to

308
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,010
relive the past

309
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:52,810
oh my dear Zeus that's unfortunately

310
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:54,790
exactly why we're here and you'll need

311
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:56,980
to forge this not easy these days if you

312
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:59,110
say so discount albino matrix twin the

313
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:00,580
truth is we know so little about how

314
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,020
those discs work it's almost like

315
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:08,800
nonsense anyway so Agent Orange crashes

316
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,150
through the roof and everyone panics but

317
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,650
the DJ's are just like oh we totally

318
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:13,540
have a group for this if the staff does

319
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,100
the job why waste time on kicks and

320
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:18,300
punches

321
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,730
well suck my desk you son of a glitches

322
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:23,170
what Flynn should have set in the

323
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:24,190
version of this movie where they

324
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,690
realized they had already gone so far

325
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:26,740
off the rails that they might as well

326
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:31,870
embrace it they use latex Makana why is

327
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,910
Flint sanity here just now stepping into

328
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:35,350
this fight and using whatever these God

329
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:37,240
powers are he rode with Cora right if he

330
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,800
can neo this matrix that hard why not

331
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,110
lead with it so what do we do now we do

332
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:43,330
nothing we do it your way

333
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:45,730
full-on sprint to the portal well that

334
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:46,630
escalated quickly

335
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:48,640
would be clue there we have a chance but

336
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,230
why didn't clue leave for the portal the

337
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:52,150
second that he got Flynn's disc why does

338
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,650
he have to make a rousing speech gah

339
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:55,450
this is still technically a game right

340
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:57,519
aren't there rules this is

341
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,139
well good thing whatever the this is was

342
00:11:00,139 --> 00:11:01,519
sitting right there ready to take off

343
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,019
movie is doing a terrible job of helping

344
00:11:03,019 --> 00:11:04,729
us understand why getting to the portal

345
00:11:04,729 --> 00:11:06,649
is such an insurmountable task she said

346
00:11:06,649 --> 00:11:12,470
I saw the last I saw all right and I so

347
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:14,149
of course that would explain this much

348
00:11:14,149 --> 00:11:15,769
younger female live-in companion much

349
00:11:15,769 --> 00:11:16,999
better than what's been creeping me out

350
00:11:16,999 --> 00:11:18,649
for the last hour of this movie now it's

351
00:11:18,649 --> 00:11:20,149
time for you to tell me a story

352
00:11:20,149 --> 00:11:22,549
dammit Flynn no enough story time this

353
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:24,169
movie has more stories than the building

354
00:11:24,169 --> 00:11:25,939
formerly known as the Sears Tower ice

355
00:11:25,939 --> 00:11:28,539
caps are melting war in the Middle East

356
00:11:28,539 --> 00:11:32,059
Laker Celtics back no mention of Robert

357
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:33,619
Pattinson and Kristen Stewart making it

358
00:11:33,619 --> 00:11:35,209
official the beginning stages of one

359
00:11:35,209 --> 00:11:37,039
direction or the Lady Gaga meat dress

360
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:38,749
why is Sam leaving out all the important

361
00:11:38,749 --> 00:11:41,269
events should have seen this place back

362
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:43,970
then couldn't wait to show it to you man

363
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,499
I thought Flynn couldn't sound any more

364
00:11:45,499 --> 00:11:47,089
like a nostalgic hippie but apparently I

365
00:11:47,089 --> 00:11:49,189
was wrong I'm gonna head home for one

366
00:11:49,189 --> 00:11:50,239
more day with you

367
00:11:50,239 --> 00:11:52,069
Jesus Flynn's character Arcas flimsier

368
00:11:52,069 --> 00:11:53,779
than a sheet of digital saran wrap wait

369
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:55,879
is that the chrome logo on Zeus's

370
00:11:55,879 --> 00:11:57,829
forehead I mean bar owners do have to

371
00:11:57,829 --> 00:11:59,599
open multiple tabs so I guess it makes

372
00:11:59,599 --> 00:12:05,739
sense you had the drink

373
00:12:05,739 --> 00:12:08,059
how did chrome-dome not see this

374
00:12:08,059 --> 00:12:09,799
double-cross coming and more importantly

375
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:11,119
why is he just standing here when it's

376
00:12:11,119 --> 00:12:12,229
obvious this building's about to blow up

377
00:12:12,229 --> 00:12:16,069
the Sun yeah I've never had to describe

378
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:20,509
it before wha radiant beautiful and one

379
00:12:20,509 --> 00:12:21,709
of the few things that could wake you up

380
00:12:21,709 --> 00:12:23,509
after Garrett Hedlund vocal cadence put

381
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:26,389
you to sleep oh just another unnecessary

382
00:12:26,389 --> 00:12:28,189
plot device that pans the run time

383
00:12:28,189 --> 00:12:29,749
seriously this needs a harsh fucking

384
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,459
editor it's got cool ideas great music

385
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,139
and excellent visuals can't get out of

386
00:12:33,139 --> 00:12:35,209
its own weight I've seen what users are

387
00:12:35,209 --> 00:12:37,190
capable of glue

388
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,590
you don't belong with them what exactly

389
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:41,270
are users capable of doing playing

390
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:42,950
Uncharted for 72 hours straight while

391
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:51,470
ingesting Ho Hos and dr. pepper but it's

392
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,510
closing up soon right so maybe you cut

393
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,920
the speech a little short or just mix it

394
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,690
all together he's taken all this with

395
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:59,690
him these figures out how to do it yes

396
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:01,010
because the disk thing is in the

397
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:02,300
stand-up thing and the glowy lights are

398
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,710
moving and there's orange stripes and

399
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:05,360
stuff every single light in this area is

400
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,560
glowing orange except for the one our

401
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,660
hero happens to need for camouflage so

402
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:13,400
that worked out nicely I'm not a program

403
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:17,750
my name is Sam flan really movie has

404
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,790
been nothing but more philosophizing and

405
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,680
story exposition for the last 25 minutes

406
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,150
but the second the action is about to

407
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,320
get good you pull the cut to the

408
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,760
surprise guy in the other room hearing

409
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,770
it happen routine not cool man not cool

410
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:31,340
at all totally so I'm taking this

411
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:38,270
vehicle you were not authorized Jedi

412
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:39,710
mind-trick has certainly evolved over

413
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:42,620
the years China honest you're gonna need

414
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,090
it sure clue is coming after these

415
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,890
assholes with a literal army and the

416
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:47,270
portal may close at any moment they

417
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:48,560
still definitely have time for what

418
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,060
passes is witty banter in this movie

419
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:55,010
nice sure but couldn't she have just

420
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:56,690
flown over did he just give a subtle

421
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:58,400
hand signal to another moving jet from

422
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,020
50 yards away I got a hand signal for

423
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,430
your movie but it's not exactly as

424
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:04,760
subtle as that one so you've got a

425
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,620
hotshot kid in the rear gunner chair in

426
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,090
a space battle I think what you mean to

427
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:09,890
say is I've got a bad feeling about this

428
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,880
Tron

429
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,320
come I've been asking myself the same

430
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,790
question for the last hour and 47

431
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:19,509
minutes miss Hoover it's all in our

432
00:14:19,509 --> 00:14:21,940
dream Sam you know dreams awesome I

433
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,110
guess we'll never know what the hell

434
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:24,459
happened to this poor bastard even

435
00:14:24,459 --> 00:14:26,019
though his character is the namesake of

436
00:14:26,019 --> 00:14:30,220
the franchise that is take it down hang

437
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:33,819
on ruff I guess every landing scene is

438
00:14:33,819 --> 00:14:35,470
required to include this dialogue even

439
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:37,000
though Korra has never flown this ship

440
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,709
before or landed anywhere near the port

441
00:14:40,709 --> 00:14:43,360
exactly they saw Tron take out clue ship

442
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,529
so how would he have gotten here well

443
00:14:47,529 --> 00:14:49,600
maybe for 2010 but Flynn should try

444
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,279
watching this movie now as if it didn't

445
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,079
borrow from a galaxy far far away enough

446
00:14:53,079 --> 00:14:57,839
she has an actual lightsaber

447
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:00,100
this twist is remarkable for being

448
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,630
extremely obvious and somehow at the

449
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:02,829
same time completely incomprehensible

450
00:15:02,829 --> 00:15:04,389
since when can you wear someone else's

451
00:15:04,389 --> 00:15:04,930
disc

452
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:06,130
can someone please do an explainer on

453
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:08,800
how this technology works oh and you

454
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,870
were right about what I'm behind

455
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,850
everything no seriously what exactly was

456
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:14,110
he right about we've been gridlocked for

457
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:15,459
about two hours here and honestly can't

458
00:15:15,459 --> 00:15:16,930
remember what he said to you what's next

459
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:19,209
Sam I guess we're supposed to change the

460
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:19,600
world

461
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,220
how does Corps exist in the physical

462
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,870
world where did her body come from can

463
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:24,069
someone help me understand the mystery

464
00:15:24,069 --> 00:15:26,829
