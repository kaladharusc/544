00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,380
Welcome back to &quot;Totally True Documentary.&quot;

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:10,600
Today, we follow controversial teenage influencer Brianna Boho, to get a glimpse of her daily life.

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,520
Oh my god

4
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:13,780
*gasp*

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,680
Oh f***. Am I on queer eye?

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,840
Oh no Brianna. Um, this is the documentary *inaudible* telling you about

7
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,600
Um, they were waiting here for like 6 hours.

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,700
Oh my god, you guys wanna follow me around

9
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,020
Oh my God, my first stalkers.

10
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,020
I'm Brianna Boho, bitches!

11
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,860
I'm 18 years old, been arrested twice

12
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:32,600
once for public nudity and the other for public nudity

13
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,920
I also gained 10,000 subscribers a day

14
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,140
So, eat my ass

15
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,960
Like, for real, what can't I do?

16
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,740
First off, I own a mansion

17
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:44,640
So, here is where the magic happens

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,780
backdrop for videos, obviously

19
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,080
Merch, posters..

20
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,820
Swipe up ;)

21
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,920
And yes, so this is like a creative space and

22
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,140
What inspires me to create is like

23
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:57,760
Me

24
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,360
I mean like, obviously I mean *inaudible*

25
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,900
But yeah, I'm making music speKCifically

26
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,380
I make rap

27
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:06,980
Had a convention but somebody died

28
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:11,260
I'm gonna do this with the rest of my life. Yah. Yah. Yah bitch

29
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,260
Yah, yah. Yah

30
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,940
Who wrote this? This is really good

31
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:22,480
Fans love a good story time about my life. Like they eat that up. These kids will watch anything dude, like

32
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,340
Anything!

33
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:25,420
except for right now

34
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:27,040
My views are kind of trash

35
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,560
but, all I'll  have to really do is just like, start another Twitter beef with Vince

36
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,320
You probably don't know who he is. I'm like, way more relevant.

37
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:39,880
Vince DiMaggio a.k.a. ItsYaBoyVD, is an Instagram comedian featured on one of our previous episodes

38
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:45,420
He recently caused controversy when he uploaded a video of himself building fighting robots out of roadkill

39
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:51,760
Yo, yo, yo my lack of empathy makes me look cooler to kids

40
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,840
Yeah

41
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,540
*knocking*

42
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:58,340
Yo, what up Vince Nation!!

43
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,840
It's ya boy VD

44
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,140
Still in the game

45
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,320
Killin' it!

46
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,340
Monique, turn that ass around

47
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:05,840
Tag me!

48
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,159
Nah, bitch

49
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:08,920
Every time I make a video with Brianna

50
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,500
I get at least two million views in a day

51
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:18,220
Gotta milk that cow till' it's dry aka make videos with her until she gets UGLY

52
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:21,000
Well, if you want to get Instagram followers too then we're gonna have to do it that way.

53
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,900
Yeah. Well look the look B, look B

54
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:26,200
I'm not gonna make a response video, unless you give me some like good footage

55
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,540
of you being a psycho in public

56
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:33,560
I want a subtweet, a fight video and a response video with like an apology and a comment about my ass

57
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:40,640
Uh, LMAO my ass off, that's asking way too much. I would never do that in a million years. I

58
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,960
Unless you gave me some nudes.

59
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,940
NO

60
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:44,580
Maybe

61
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:48,700
Tell you what, we do a live video of us fighting right? Right?

62
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:52,840
Then we do like an apology video and then an Instagram post about how we friends again

63
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,240
Shmoney? Shmoney.

64
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,020
Aight, so who's gonna film this this then?

65
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,220
Monique, she's nothing better to do

66
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:02,840
Oh, word

67
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,360
Yah, yah, yah, yah.

68
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,500
Okay, you going? Okay, I swear to God if you bring up my nose job -

69
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,280
Screw off VD, I'm done.

70
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,600
Well, then why you always gotta subtweet me? Is it 'cause you're jealous of me?

71
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,360
No you're jealous I got clout

72
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,160
You're just jealous cause I have these hot ass extensions

73
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,900
while you're stuck hiding your balding ass head with a hat

74
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,540
Yo, B

75
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:26,240
Cut it. B, we can't talk about the hair. Alright?

76
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,800
It's sensitive subject to me aight? Okay.

77
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,860
Roll it again

78
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,920
Oh yeah VD? Oh yeah VD?

79
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,740
Oh yeah?

80
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:39,520
Well, watch this!

81
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:47,940
Oh my god, Monique! Stop playing dead to keep retention! Nobody cares if you die

82
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:54,680
Yo... this bitch dead

83
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,980
After the public outrage over Monique's death,

84
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:08,420
Brianna took a week off from YouTube, then came back with an anti-killing your friend video.

85
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:15,870
I have learned so much about how my actions cause the problems that I cause with my actions and

86
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:19,280
it was a lot of problems when I

87
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,480
Accidentally killed my not very close friend accidentally

88
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,060
So, I'm talking to other people who have also

89
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,740
accidentally killed their friends

90
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,940
So,

91
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,940
you killed your friend?

92
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,080
Yeah.

93
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,800
We were in a car

94
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,300
Wow. Wow!

95
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,760
And then out of no where it just like -

96
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,240
That's so deep.

97
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,960
That's so deep

98
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,020
Yeah, it was unbelievable. I just couldn't not -

99
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,420
Don't accidentally kill your friends.

100
00:04:47,420 --> 00:05:04,320
I will carry this pain with me for the rest of my life and this, has changed me forever

101
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,660
Raaaaawrrr getting it raspyyyy

102
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:16,820
It brings my voice box back down to its raspiness, so now I gotta go

103
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,280
Oh my god not the fireplace again!

104
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,360
Monique? Monique.

105
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,520
Okay, so let's move on to the kitchen. It's mostly gushers

106
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:29,630
Whoa, uh oh

107
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:32,630
Where am I supposed to go in here?

108
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:35,500
Yo, do you remember how we got in here?

109
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,300
I'm lost.

110
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,240
Oh it feels like gummy bears and vodka!

111
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:45,640
Do I look okay?

112
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,920
Yeah

113
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:51,860
*laughter*

114
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:54,610
