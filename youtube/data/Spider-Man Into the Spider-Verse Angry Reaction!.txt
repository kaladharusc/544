31
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,820
okay that was a freaking awesome that

32
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,860
was freakin amazing Joe what do you

33
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,590
think I don't know it just seems like

34
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:19,800
too much too much no how dare you man

35
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,230
okay spider pig maybe for some serious

36
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:25,210
spider aficionados here's the way I look

37
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:26,770
at this Joe we got our regular

38
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:28,840
spider-man movies already let me

39
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:34,540
convince Joe movies right yeah this is

40
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:37,780
an opportunity for the animated studio

41
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:41,860
and animation to do amazingly Marvel has

42
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,050
always sucked at sort of animation right

43
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:47,080
DC is the best at animated movies but

44
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,360
with now you see Marvel got enough money

45
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,610
now to put money into the animation I

46
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:53,920
don't want to see what cuz they already

47
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,860
did this kind of with the miles for the

48
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,630
Disney Channel I want to see how that

49
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:02,680
did cuz like now I drop in knowledge

50
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,570
bombs I would I kind of want to watch it

51
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,970
but I never really got around to it so I

52
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:10,810
don't know how well it did but now that

53
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:13,720
the the spider-man game came out there's

54
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,670
so much hype around exactly especially

55
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:18,190
Miles Morales yeah I'm down to watch it

56
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,620
but to me the whole pig you know

57
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,660
everybody else for the powers from all

58
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,760
these dimensions right I didn't really

59
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,860
think into the spider-verse was really

60
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,919
gonna come into plan story you know what

61
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,090
you i'm starting to see your point a

62
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:32,770
little bit i thought it was just a story

63
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:34,570
between Peter Parker and Miles Morales

64
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:36,910
and I think if it had remained that then

65
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:39,520
the story might be stronger but what I

66
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,919
why I was so excited at the end is

67
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,919
because I don't mind this

68
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,460
I don't mind my crazy story they're just

69
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,020
giving everybody powers now

70
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,300
all right right see I've always been a

71
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,669
fan of you know miles getting his powers

72
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:55,050
through like some sort of blood

73
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:57,300
transfusion from Peter I was hoping that

74
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,180
they'd go that direction in the

75
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:03,090
spider-man to ps4 but that's not the

76
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:04,499
case because he's from a you know a

77
00:05:04,499 --> 00:05:06,719
different dimension you see so obviously

78
00:05:06,719 --> 00:05:09,180
well actually there was a Peter Parker

79
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,710
in that dimension too but he died in

80
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:13,919
Miles Morales took over his position but

81
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,469
okay so here's there's a lot to go over

82
00:05:16,469 --> 00:05:19,919
here I just I really like the animation

83
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,050
stuff though okay I want to talk about

84
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:24,360
the animation style don't like it so I

85
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,210
really like it but there's one thing

86
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:30,029
that I absolutely hate that I think

87
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:32,580
ruins it do you know what it is no I do

88
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:36,139
know if you if you look at the animation

89
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:41,819
look at how jumpy it's very jumpy it's

90
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:44,279
like I'm I come from the computer world

91
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:46,740
we're all constantly making reviews and

92
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,810
videos on the computer and when frame

93
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:50,849
rates drop this is what it looks like

94
00:05:50,849 --> 00:05:53,939
we're dropping frames here Joe look at

95
00:05:53,939 --> 00:05:55,620
the way he's talking his lips move it

96
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,409
but yeah we're dropping frames yeah I

97
00:05:58,409 --> 00:05:59,789
can reminds me the whole Wallace and

98
00:05:59,789 --> 00:06:03,210
Gromit right so it is that's exactly

99
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:05,969
what it is Joe it's it's a style it's

100
00:06:05,969 --> 00:06:09,149
not unintentional it's intentional and I

101
00:06:09,149 --> 00:06:10,740
just want to know what it would look

102
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,080
like if the animation was smooth I think

103
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,639
if the animation was smooth it would

104
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,620
work better but this is a stylistic

105
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:20,550
choice and it's not gonna bother me I've

106
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:22,110
already gotten used to it from the

107
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:25,349
trailers but but here I just love the

108
00:06:25,349 --> 00:06:27,800
fact that we're gonna get Big Time

109
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,560
animations in the theater and what

110
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,330
that's gonna do is it's gonna open

111
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:35,729
things up even crazier for not only

112
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:39,389
Marvel but my boys DC you see because DC

113
00:06:39,389 --> 00:06:44,729
rules the animated world okay and you

114
00:06:44,729 --> 00:06:46,710
guys know it even Marvel fanboys know

115
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:49,379
this now if this does well in the

116
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:51,930
theater what I'm thinking is that DC

117
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:52,820
will go

118
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,880
hmm okay and they'll put a ton of money

119
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,640
or a ton of effort into a theatrical you

120
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,960
know type thing just like this

121
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,060
and and that just opens the door for all

122
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:07,190
kinds of stuff comic book fan heaven

123
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,840
it's already comic book fan having with

124
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,800
16 17 18 films in the Marvel Universe

125
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,300
but the DC Universe is where it's

126
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:18,590
hurting so DC fanboys that's where we

127
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:20,630
have our hope in spider-man into the

128
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:21,140
spider-verse

129
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,480
not only is a great spider-man story but

130
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,790
also you know as other things but man

131
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:27,890
this reminds me a lot of the Sam Raimi

132
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,570
there was a lot of scenes in here Sam

133
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:31,010
Raimi spider-man this is Sam in

134
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:32,690
spider-man and then you remember when

135
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:34,580
that the car coming through the window

136
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:39,200
except it it ended differently so that's

137
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,400
really fun

138
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,740
you got the comic book style here and

139
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:47,930
you know he's telling the story about so

140
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:49,190
what do you think about spider-man's

141
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:52,520
voice I remember his name but I I don't

142
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,710
know his real name

143
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:58,160
he's Nick from the new girl alright yeah

144
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,830
yeah

145
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:11,420
Jake Johnson at first I didn't like it

146
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,730
but then I guess over time I you know

147
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:15,530
watching the trailer and him having that

148
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:17,950
that five o'clock shadow and being all

149
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:20,900
right fine whatever I'm not gonna

150
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,660
complain about that you know but boy I

151
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,670
really didn't expect all these different

152
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,800
characters no I thought it was really

153
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,990
just gonna focus on him and spider-man

154
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,880
was gonna make a small cameo scene right

155
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:35,840
and so I got even happier when I saw

156
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,250
spider-man towards the beginning of this

157
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,260
trailer it's a buddy movie it's like let

158
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,790
me teach you how to do these things and

159
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:42,770
I was like yes yes yes and then I

160
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:45,170
understand once you get over here where

161
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:52,850
Joe's like no no no cones so I guess in

162
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:54,980
in the spider-man comics now I don't

163
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,420
want I don't read every single

164
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,430
spider-man comic outside the main line

165
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:00,770
there's some universe we're going Stacey

166
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:03,260
is not a spider powers I'd like to know

167
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,760
in the comments leave how she got her

168
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,560
because if she got bit by a spider -

169
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,600
it's like alright guys come on now let's

170
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,520
come up with some more creative things

171
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,380
maybe some blood transfusions or

172
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,880
something like I'm kind of curious how

173
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,980
the pig got its powers - I don't even

174
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,020
know if they will actually cover that in

175
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,490
this film joke see that's what I'll say

176
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:23,010
it's too much it's too much you know I

177
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:25,020
was thinking maybe Gwen and then I said

178
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:31,520
but no now we have a film noir robot

179
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,080
which is gonna do well with overwatch

180
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,770
fans you know and and then we have

181
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:45,150
Spider straight animation which I think

182
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:48,480
it's a really fun man I love it but I

183
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:54,779
hate how low frame rate yeah I need that

184
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:57,589
smoothness I want the film to be smooth

185
00:09:57,589 --> 00:10:00,570
all right so let's so we're speculating

186
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:06,360
on the villains here that I think maybe

187
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,350
has something to do with Miles Morales

188
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:13,560
is uncle or no I think this is the film

189
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:20,160
this is what his name is like I don't

190
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,610
know but I thought I saw scorpion

191
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:25,800
I think this is what is it what was that

192
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,860
guy tombstone or what's his name the guy

193
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,680
in spider-man I think it's tombstone and

194
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,650
then I think this is Green Goblin so

195
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:37,650
we've got three right there and I'm sure

196
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:39,630
we're missing one you guys let us know

197
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:43,860
which one we're missing but yeah it just

198
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,560
to me it looks funny as hell it's it's

199
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,990
definitely an ensemble film one two

200
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:52,950
three four five six six different spider

201
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:55,650
people might be getting a little big I

202
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:58,290
guess maybe this is a security guard or

203
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:05,130
Peter Parker's friend or mouse

204
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:07,410
alright so oh and the fact that it's on

205
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:09,390
Christmas I think this thing is gonna do

206
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:12,630
really well I want this to do as well as

207
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,829
a feature

208
00:11:13,829 --> 00:11:16,709
you know Marvel film right it's not

209
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:18,580
going to I don't think because

210
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,170
you know maybe the adults are like

211
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:22,750
animated I need live action what do you

212
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,280
