3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:17,850

4
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,949
to start here in this hotel room it's not a particularly glamorous hotel room

5
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:29,550
got this couch got this then there's one window with a great view of the parking

6
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:34,800
lot like this kitchen at situation over here and I probably shouldn't show you

9
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,660
the roof of the parking garage

10
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,770
it's the only place I could find in all of VidCon where I can say flight that

11
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,789
grow without having any security or police getting a really hard time
