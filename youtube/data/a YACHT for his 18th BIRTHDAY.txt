I also feel bad for Owen he was up literally the entire night

73
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:47,830
I guess jet lag got the better of him so now he's just like completely zonked out

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,450
I think this car ride to wake him up oh and you only go for the car right now

82
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,900

83
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:38,610
easy to turn

84
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,610
your boat

85
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:45,820
Oh

86
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,600
breaks up I'm real and the day

87
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,779
ship to an automatic

88
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:53,980
this road is like they're pretty terribly this like an inch wide

89
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:59,860
on the other side and just like they don't know

90
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,360
each other like animals

91
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,930
can you believe what happens when you hit the gas

92
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:07,930
oh my god it's incredible

93
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:44,300
depending on how to make the drive the car drive itself look run the highway

94
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:49,740
the car is completely driving itself right now it's scaring my feet are off

95
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:52,800
that breaks and gas hands-free

96
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,580
straight chillin over here literally on the freeway look at this

97
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:03,360
but look at this look at this cars the bloggers dream

98
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:06,710
still have to pay attention

99
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:10,700
but the car does do a very nice job of driving she's doing well

100
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:13,940
watch it move look at it

101
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:25,089
taking a really quick break from driving here going to the super Marche that

102
00:10:25,089 --> 00:10:28,089
means supermarket French

103
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:32,630
that's fine . that is a pretty car huh

104
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:38,120
yep the lock yeah we're getting here

105
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:47,649
what do you get it what about freebo's get some rebounds for me

106
00:10:47,649 --> 00:10:50,649
that's it I think so

107
00:10:51,310 --> 00:11:01,870
it is 7pm now we've just got back a long drive and exhausted but I promise no one

108
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:05,740
would you swim in the water which apparently is freezing

109
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:08,740
and since we leave tomorrow morning that was our only chance

110
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:12,639
so we are going to some of the water

111
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,910
it's called a particular or vernacular

112
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:28,060
oh and that water does not look kosher for swimming in but it does what he does

113
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:31,630
jonylah's when it's on a cable can we take this

114
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:34,630
yes but we are closer than they appear on the talk

115
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,240
yeah this is Christy

116
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:44,499
locked

117
00:11:44,499 --> 00:11:47,980

118
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:50,980
yeah

119
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,320
this is where you want to go for a cool dip

120
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:00,190
look at the way

121
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:03,190
working with

122
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:07,630
you don't think this is too rough owned

123
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,380
all right

124
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:15,890
yeah

125
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:23,630
what

126
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:34,510
hey

127
00:12:54,810 --> 00:13:00,570
yeah

128
00:13:31,939 --> 00:13:34,819
where you start out
