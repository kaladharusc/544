1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,540
here this this is miss survival I saw it

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,279
on Steam it had good reviews for it it's

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:06,569
like a single-player Zombie Survival

4
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:08,309
kind of thing so I'm gonna try it out

5
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:10,759
and do that thing ooh

6
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:12,900
who do you get Sam at a shelter

7
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,299
management based shelter shelter command

8
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:16,590
you can manage the shelter by observing

9
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:17,940
the house symbol the dwelling will have

10
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,500
the symbol on the front door when you

11
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,090
enter the shelter's command mode you can

12
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:22,710
choose to change the base shelter and

13
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:24,060
manage to the survivors in your camp

14
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,130
survivors are only active in 50 meters

15
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:27,660
around the base mister vent the

16
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,369
appearance of each fog is company by

17
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:31,230
some events players must be prepared

18
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,480
infectious can come out outdoors only at

19
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,130
night or when there's no Sun that means

20
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,570
they can also hunt while the fog is

21
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,579
covered traveling in fog is quite

22
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:39,870
dangerous but in the mean time and this

23
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:41,640
was at the village ability of bandits

24
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,379
worsened as well bow and arrow

25
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:45,450
high-performance equipment can be used

26
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:46,950
without noise suitable for hunting or

27
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,390
assassination you have to install the

28
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,010
quiver that contains the arrows already

29
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,789
before you can use it the higher quit

30
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:55,649
you can switch arrows while using the

31
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:57,690
bow pressing our longbow can be used to

32
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,550
kill bandits and single shots when use

33
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,620
with hunting arrows fatigue and stamina

34
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,449
press 7 to sleep on the ground good to

35
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:07,560
know all right so this is mist survival

36
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,990
I think it was miss survival which I

37
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:11,250
think just means that we got to survive

38
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,619
in the mist so I guess it's kind of like

39
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:23,189
a forest style survival thing but give

40
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:26,400
give give to me give ok

41
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,400
we got that I could sleep shelter

42
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,530
command well this is a shelter

43
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,180
manager room by clicking the green space

44
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,100
we don't even have rooms it's just 2

45
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,439

48
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:44,070
houses just a pile of sticks and leaves

49
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,829
with like some kind of a tarp a carpet

50

that's not I had on this side

166
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:11,009
[Music]

167
00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:14,669
oh yeah I'm just turning my back to this

168
00:08:14,669 --> 00:08:17,849
bear that was over there who knows if

169
00:08:17,849 --> 00:08:20,849
it's still there mmm I don't know

170
00:08:20,849 --> 00:08:28,969
oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah

171
00:08:28,969 --> 00:08:31,529
okay well it was falling realistically

172
00:08:31,529 --> 00:08:33,329
right up in there until the end okay log

173
00:08:33,329 --> 00:08:38,010
log log log log I got log so was it that

174
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,870
bear that was making the rocks all fall

175
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:42,269
down something like that maybe I don't

176
00:08:42,269 --> 00:08:44,399
know seems like it might have been

177
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,829
something was going off there no no what

178
00:08:46,829 --> 00:08:50,730
but it wasn't fun and nope right at the

179
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,319
end there gets all kind of against

180
00:08:52,319 --> 00:08:53,220
physics okay

181
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,290
so I got some logs I don't have any gas

182
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:58,680
but now I've got a home base so oh I'm

183
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,899
full up apparently so I can make

184
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:03,240
firewood I can make regular wood which

185
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,360
is probably good let me do some regular

186
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,690
wood standing out in the open there's a

187
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:12,000
bear over wait is that for wait whoa

188
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,019
they said something about fog wait a

189
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:19,079
minute wait a minute they said something

190
00:09:19,079 --> 00:09:22,019
about fog I remember the name of this

191
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:24,630
game might be mist survival maybe I

192
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,360
could beef up the other defenses here

193
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,170
but maybe I could there's like a hammer

194
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,940
a sleeping bag I don't have any

195
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:38,610
oh how do I make up mm can I

196
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:45,569
make a bowl just gonna grab these hope

197
00:09:45,569 --> 00:09:49,920
nothing bad happens okay miss gone

198
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:56,459
apparently I guess the mist is gone it's

199
00:09:56,459 --> 00:09:57,959
gonna get night here soon and that's

200
00:09:57,959 --> 00:09:59,670
probably not good why does it keep

201
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:01,350
saying I have so many logs I don't have

202
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:04,350
that many logs logs

203
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:06,779
okay now I'm apparently out of logs but

204
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:09,779
just hasn't updated okay so I'm slightly

205
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:12,149
wounded I don't know I don't know when

206
00:10:12,149 --> 00:10:14,220
that happened I thought I thought I was

207
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:17,160
fully unmuted but apparently not I'm

208
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,870
just gonna create keep making these cuz

209
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,730
I don't know when and where I'm supposed

210
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:22,500
to not do this alright that's good I'm

211
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,709
out of bandages too so I guess I'm just

212
00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:27,420
 I'm gonna leave here I'm gonna go

213
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,860
somewhere else I don't know where that

214
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,600
bear would the Bears right there okay

215
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,560
I'm gonna go in the opposite direction

216
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,259
of where the bear was and hopefully not

217
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:35,639
run into another bear hey here's

218
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:40,079
something well that looks fun I like to

219
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:41,310
look at this I don't know who built a

220
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:43,500
house in the middle of nothing not even

221
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,920
a road leading up to it but I like it

222
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,509
oh there is a road I'm just an idiot

223
00:10:48,509 --> 00:10:51,779
okay so does this one have any gas in it

224
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:52,800
I bet not

225
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,560
no no gas okay I bet doesn't even work

226
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,959
all right

227
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:03,329
hello anybody home I got an axe just so

228
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:08,819
you know whoo knock knock knock knock

229
00:11:08,819 --> 00:11:11,009
can't unlock it I don't have a crowbar

230
00:11:11,009 --> 00:11:16,709
okay wood wood wood duh what is this it

231
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:18,740
I can't get to the other area I guess

232
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:21,000
okay I don't have a lockpick and I don't

233
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,279
have a crowbar they got a lot of

234
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,889
firewood though so that's nice for them

235
00:11:24,889 --> 00:11:28,589
but not much else of anything else

236
00:11:28,589 --> 00:11:31,050
I just bash open one of these yeah yeah

237
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:35,250
why not right right right right

238
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:38,569
Oh

239
00:11:38,569 --> 00:11:42,060
what broke right just break what adds

240
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,009
break what did I break not what I wanted

241
00:11:44,009 --> 00:11:45,449
to break well what did I break I don't

242
00:11:45,449 --> 00:11:45,930
know whatever

243
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:47,699
okay that didn't work let's move on it's

244
00:11:47,699 --> 00:11:48,990
gonna be night soon ooh there's another

245
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:50,850
bear I don't want to get in a fight with

246
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:52,350
a bear what is that

247
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:56,160
what are those Oh wind turbines is this

248
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,290
a farm man I know nothing about this

249
00:11:58,290 --> 00:11:59,670
game but there's a barn over there so

250
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:01,110
I'm assuming that there's gonna be stuff

251
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:02,910
towards the buildings I mean that's just

252
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:05,370
my general instinct on anything this

253
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:07,500
one's got gas but this one's got no oh

254
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:11,880
but wait maybe I can fill the can no but

255
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,800
maybe if I find a can I can fill I get

256
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,910
this one has gas in it so yeah oh oh the

257
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:23,279
trunk oh da the trunk okay I'm gonna put

258
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,430
beef kick me again

259
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:28,410
it could be kept for a long time without

260
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:31,889
spoil let me put my rocks in here I'm

261
00:12:31,889 --> 00:12:34,170
gonna take the components match is

262
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,420
probably important sticks not as much

263
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,000
but I'm not gonna

264
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,410
just anything in the Aaron's gonna put

265
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:41,120
the rocks in there I should have checked

266
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,490
the trunks on the other one then but I'm

267
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:47,930
done can can can oa4 gasps oh okay so

268
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:53,420
can put this here fill the can now we

269
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:56,660
got gas all right cool we got two point

270
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:59,300
eight five liters of gas cool so now I

271
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,940
can go over to the other car that I saw

272
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,620
and I should definitely be checking the

273
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,150
trunks of these bad boys but there was

274
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,620
another car over here so let me just go

275
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,150
over here and check the trunk first and

276
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,950
then I can use this is like my storage

277
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:11,990
vehicle and always keep stuff in it and

278
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:14,300
it'll be good to go right oh it's got no

279
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,450
tires oh that's that would be a problem

280
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:20,180
okay yeah this says okay this this is

281
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,130
more problem than just no gas okay I bet

282
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:23,480
the other one had tires though because

283
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,160
it had an option to actually drive it

284
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:34,070
right why what happened was weird okay

285
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:36,590
whatever Zef tires no tires okay that's

286
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:41,090
a problem okay well I'm gonna fill the

287
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:44,030
tank up ah tires need to go get tires

288
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:48,020
okay problem all right what if I just

289
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:55,610
here we go okay close I don't think it's

290
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:57,440
going nowhere okay so that's going

291
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:02,330
nowhere but but but but what but big but

292
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:04,310
let me let me fill the can take this

293
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,620
with me but now I think I got an idea of

294
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,839
what I'm gonna do so oh I need to grab

295
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:11,660
that can so I think I'm gonna use this

296
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:12,950
as my home base I'm gonna fill the

297
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:15,410
locker with stuff that things I don't

298
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:17,660
need like this extra wood I don't need

299
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:20,330
yet this stick these sticks I can get

300
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:22,220
that anywhere I'm gonna take the rope

301
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:25,580
the fuel the matches some food and some

302
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,770
water that's why I'm gonna take with me

303
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:30,140
I'm gonna go over to that barn I'm gonna

304
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:32,630
see what's up it's cool like this is a

305
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:33,980
surprisingly well-made game I mean this

306
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,170
is an early access one so I just saw it

307
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:37,820
randomly on Steam but I was like hey

308
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,740
what seems like it's got some potential

309
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:43,070
here oh cool I'll take that hammer that

310
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:46,160
seems useful I don't know why but it

311
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,740
seems useful does Ainley ooh give me

312

315
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:59,330
don't ask me I don't know I don't know

316
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:01,070

638
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:49,320

then I could make stuff out of it right

648
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:11,850
crafting is probably gonna be pretty big

649
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:15,149
in this sewing kit can I so up my wounds

650
00:34:15,149 --> 00:34:18,929
looks like a big nope on the gun kid's

651
00:34:18,929 --> 00:34:22,919
room kids room gun maybe no it's like a

652
00:34:22,919 --> 00:34:25,169
big negative on that one all right no

653
00:34:25,169 --> 00:34:27,179
gun in the earth yeah a lot of good

654
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:29,280
stuff but no gun maybe there's something

655
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,169
in the barn that I could use if I don't

656
00:34:31,169 --> 00:34:32,879
get a med kit soon I'm gonna be very in

657
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:35,220
trouble or at least some bandages if I

658
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:37,679
hadn't lost him when I died which was

659
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,690
totally I'm still swinging my

660
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:43,889

663
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:48,810
nope let me go over to this building

664
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:50,040
maybe I can make it my home base and

665
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,840
then go for the bandit place I didn't

666
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,280
see this before because obviously it was

667
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,310
too dark yeah let's make this my base

668
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:59,609

674
00:35:14,339 --> 00:35:15,780
keep the sewing kit on me just in case

675
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,970
okay cool let's go see what's out of

676
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:19,140
this camp and then I'm gonna go say hi

677
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:20,580
to the people in the band of base and

678
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:21,690
maybe go up to that tower there's

679
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:22,820

shot straight up as soon as I get close

685
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,900

686
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:39,810
to sneak in grab some bandages and get

687
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:48,680

688
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:55,079

00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:07,599
chocolate so really I'm the winner here

704
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:09,160
I'm the winner I'm a winner

705
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:12,609
I win things a lot I like to win I win

706
00:37:12,609 --> 00:37:16,450
at a great deal of things and pretty

707
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:19,059
goddamn good at my winning I just want

708
00:37:19,059 --> 00:37:20,440
to see if there's like a gun on the

709
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,210
ground because it wasn't on his body

710
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:23,950
but maybe it's one of those things where

711
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,779
it's not geared it's it's that weird

712
00:37:25,779 --> 00:37:27,490
game mechanic where he has a gun very

713
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:29,680
clearly has gun but he's not guaranteed

714
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,390
to drop the gun like that's the thing

715
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:33,730
that's the discrepancy I'm gonna soup

716
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:34,960
you should oh there's a building over

717
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,130
there too maybe there's something in

718
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:38,109
there I like I want I'm sneaking I get

719
00:37:38,109 --> 00:37:40,289
quieter cuz I'm like a little Jewish

720
00:37:40,289 --> 00:37:44,319
don't wanna spook him okay doesn't look

721
00:37:44,319 --> 00:37:48,970
like anything that was their sewing kit

722
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:51,430
wait is that my wait is that the

723
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:56,170
 I dropped wait if I go back no

724
00:37:56,170 --> 00:38:00,339
please okay is it is it like that where

725
00:38:00,339 --> 00:38:02,950
if I go back to where I was I might be

726
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:06,970
able to get my stuff again maybe no you

727
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:08,260
don't see nothing I don't know

728
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:11,650
you talkin bout Meester imma steal your

729
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:17,770
soda why can I steal this ooh I thought

730
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:20,770
I saw somebody you compare Li can't

731
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:23,020
steal things when you're crouched didn't

732
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:25,380
know that a gun I see you got in there I

733
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:28,030
want that this is probably like the

734
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:29,920
hardest way you could possibly play this

735
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,440
game trying to assault like this bass

736
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,240
with nothing but a knife and some

737
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,550
blueberries but I'm doing it I'm doing

738
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:39,010
it I'm gonna do it I'm doing it

739
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:41,860
oh I am doing currently am do okay so it

740
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,450
seems like it's just these two guys that

741
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:45,210
guy don't even have a gun

742
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:47,500
stupid idiot and this guy off to the

743
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,540
right picking him off

744
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:51,520
yeah that guy so this guy patrols back

745
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,280
and forth II all back he forth he like

746
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,930
but none of them seem to look over this

747
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:58,240
way so maybe if the front doors unlock

748
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:02,920
oh that there was another guy there was

749
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:06,100
another guy I thought there was I don't

750
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,310
know where he was where did he go

751
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:12,700
where'd he go where'd he go Oh Darius

752
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:19,720
oh ah into the sunday okay here's how

753
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:20,920
I'm gonna play this because I killed

754
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,990
that guy off to the left first last time

755
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:25,300
and that didn't go good for me so I'm

756
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,800
trying to kill the guy off to the right

757
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,370
this time and that'll probably also not

758
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:32,860
go good for me but I'll feel good about

759
