1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,740
what's up ladies and gentlemen of

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,540
YouTube boogie2988 coming at you llamas

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:04,950
again through the power of the Internet

4
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:06,480
and you are watching my weekly gaming

5
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,400
news show so let's just get right into

6
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,620
the games I wanted to start off this

7
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:11,820
week by talking about the story about

8
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,179
IGN getting accused of plagiarism and

9
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:16,980
it's not just an accusation in this case

10
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,300
when you look at the evidence it seems

11
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,369
pretty clear-cut and dry and it's almost

12
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:21,750
a word-for-word

13
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,600
ripoff and I know it's easy to presume

14
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,070
that IGN is innocent when you see this

15
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,390
kind of stuff because IGN gets accused

16
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,279
of stuff all the time people say that

17
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,990
you know they do do fake reviews they

18
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,210
get paid off they get BS all kinds of

19
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:34,770
different stuff I don't think any of

20
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:36,239
that stuff is true but in this case I do

21
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:37,980
think it is definitely true if you watch

22
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,809
the video I've listed a thumbnail for

23
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:41,309
here or I'll probably link in the

24
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:42,660
description box below as well

25
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,309
it's called IG and copied my dead cells

26
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:46,379
review what do I do the evidence is

27
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,030
pretty overwhelming now there is such a

28
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:49,530
thing's called parallel thinking where

29
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,270
two people might play the same game get

30
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,370
the same thoughts and set side by side

31
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,050
they might look slightly similar or

32
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:56,940
relatively similar but if you watch this

33
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,219
video it is almost a word-for-word case

34
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:01,170
by case structure for structure a

35
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,840
paragraph by paragraph reproduction

36
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,519
there's not just a handful of lines but

37
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,590
a mass majority of both videos are

38
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,659
almost identical it's it's really

39
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:11,729
surprising dead cells figures out an

40
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:13,380
intriguing way to have your roguelite

41
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,479
and Metroidvania experience all in one

42
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:17,400
by focusing on your failures and urging

43
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,900
you to try something new the next time

44
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,759
dead cells strikes a perfect and

45
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:22,140
engaging balance between the

46
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,450
metroidvania and roguelike experiences

47
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,790
by focusing on your failures and urging

48
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:29,009
you to experiment each time you do fail

49
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:30,150
now obviously I'm someone who's going to

50
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,500
give anybody the benefit of the doubt

51
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,729
and I'm hoping that this wasn't

52
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:34,409
malicious or nefarious maybe it was

53
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:36,570
accidental the folks over at IGN are

54
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,280
doing the only thing that they can do

55
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,720
which is they took the review down

56
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,610
they've issued a kind of apology and

57
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:42,659
said they are launching an investigation

58
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:44,700
to get to the bottom of it to see if

59
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,740
this is plagiarism that's about the only

60
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,960
thing I think we could respect here my

61
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,159
biggest concern is this might be a

62
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,020
reviewer who has reviewed a game that

63
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,670
they barely even played or did not play

64
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,380
and instead just watch somebody else's

65
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,689
review and then copied that review to

66
00:01:57,689 --> 00:01:59,490
replace it as her own and the biggest

67
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:01,049
issue with that is the fact that he is

68
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:03,750
giving a review score on a national

69
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,850
website one that will affect Metacritic

70
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,469
one will that affect the sales of this

71
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:09,780
game one that will impact the way these

72
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,879
developers succeed or fail or get paid

73
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:12,840
you

74
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,670
can't do that that's absolutely not

75
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:16,110
something you can do and don't get me

76
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,220
wrong there's periods of time where I

77
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,629
haven't played a game yet but I choose

78
00:02:18,629 --> 00:02:20,250
to still discuss it but I would never

79
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,290
say that I played it I might just show

80
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:23,580
you the review scores I might show you

81
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,230
what the community's talking about but I

82
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:26,879
would never lie to you and say I have

83
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,019
played a game that I haven't played

84
00:02:28,019 --> 00:02:30,750
especially giving it a review score

85
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,519
that's going to affect the developers is

86
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:34,290
that's that would be absurd completely

87
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,060
absurd and if you look at boom stick

88
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,709
gaming where this video came from and I

89
00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:38,670
hope that you do it because they do a

90
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,590
very good job over there it's a very

91
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,420
small publication it's a very small

92
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,489
youtuber and it seemed like maybe they

93
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:45,870
thought they could get away with it by

94
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:48,000
lifting the the script from a smaller

95
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,310
youtuber that would be absurd to think

96
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,140
that you can do that the internet always

97
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,239
finds out the internet always finds out

98
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:55,769
that's why I'll never plagiarize that's

99
00:02:55,769 --> 00:02:57,629
why you should never play dereyes the

100
00:02:57,629 --> 00:03:00,120
internet will always find out if you

101
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,890
copy a small youtuber he'll make a small

102
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,599
video about it and then that video will

103
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,160
get on the front page of Reddit and the

104
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,090
next thing you know you're getting

105
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:08,790
investigated by IGN said just don't now

106
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:09,780
here's another thing that's very

107
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,099
upsetting to folks of us who were

108
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:12,930
excited about Spyro the reignited

109
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,780
trilogy which looks pretty fantastic

110
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,250
especially because they're building it

111
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,930
kind of from the ground up the way that

112
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,930
they did Crash Bandicoot but the folks

113
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,730
over at Activision always ready to

114
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,799
disappoint have decided to disappoint by

115
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:29,040
including only one of the three games on

116
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,440
the actual physical disk the other two

117
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,569
games you're gonna have to download of

118
00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:35,609
digitally if you want to play them and

119
00:03:35,609 --> 00:03:37,109
that's even if you buy the physical disk

120
00:03:37,109 --> 00:03:38,790
now for those who are saying I buy all

121
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:41,220
my games digitally I understand I do as

122
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,750
well so this is probably not going to

123
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,459
affect me but a lot of people who are

124
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:46,889
into retro games and retro remakes who

125
00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:48,660
are going to purchase this are the kind

126
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,799
of people who would like to buy the

127
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:51,480
physical media so that they can play

128
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,280
that again eventually and here's the

129
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,299
thing they're not gonna be able to do

130
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:55,500
that without internet access they're not

131
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,700
gonna be able to do without digitally

132
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,019
downloading it they're not gonna be able

133
00:03:58,019 --> 00:03:59,880
to do it once the servers are gone this

134
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,950
remake will be lost internet history

135
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,840
because there will be no physical copy

136
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,880
of number two and number three and that

137
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,349
kind of stinks now to be fair to

138
00:04:07,349 --> 00:04:08,700
Activision I can think of a few

139
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,349
legitimate reasons you may need to do

140
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:12,540
this the first of which is maybe there's

141
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,980
just not enough room on the disk for all

142
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,630
three games though that seems very

143
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,849
unlikely considering the games that

144
00:04:17,849 --> 00:04:19,950
we're talking about here secondly it

145
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,930
could just be that the had worked on and

146
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:23,430
finished the first game by the time they

147
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,380
were ready to go gold with the disc the

148
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,210
additional two

149
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:27,680
Gamze they are not even close to

150
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,910
finishing yet and they're gonna need

151
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:31,039
literally every day to get the game done

152
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:33,169
though that bodes very very well for the

153
00:04:33,169 --> 00:04:34,910
quality of the second and third game if

154
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:36,560
that's the case regardless the folks who

155
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,060
were designing this game did make a

156
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,039
statement even though it's very much an

157
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:41,509
on statement they basically said we know

158
00:04:41,509 --> 00:04:43,190
people are excited we're sorry that this

159
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:45,199
is happening but it is happening and

160
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,310
it's not the first time it's happened in

161
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,389
the industry other people have done it

162
00:04:47,389 --> 00:04:50,060
too they didn't really give a reason but

163
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,740
I guess if you want to buy Spyro just

164
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:52,940
know you're gonna have to download the

165
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,229
second and third game you're only gonna

166
00:04:54,229 --> 00:04:55,789
get one game on disk if that's important

167
00:04:55,789 --> 00:04:57,800
to you you should know now for those of

168
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,050
you who thought see if thieves would be

169
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,570
dead in the water I'll tell you it's

170
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:05,479
Undead instead so trying to resurrect

171
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:07,759
this almost dead game see if these is

172
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,349
doing it exactly as they promised and

173
00:05:09,349 --> 00:05:10,729
they're bringing players back by adding

174
00:05:10,729 --> 00:05:13,190
content updates worth the curst sales

175
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:15,289
update there's a lot of new cosmetics a

176
00:05:15,289 --> 00:05:18,020
new ship a way to form alliances and a

177
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,880
bunch of other stuff like that as well

178
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,949
as new monsters to fight kind of they

179
00:05:21,949 --> 00:05:24,530
reused skeletons and created skeleton ie

180
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:26,270
ships so instead of just fighting other

181
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,889
players sometimes you'll be fighting

182
00:05:27,889 --> 00:05:29,330
skeletons and there's a host of

183
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,430
achievements and commendations that can

184
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:33,139
be unlocked in the process of doing this

185
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:35,330
to get new titles new sales new

186
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:37,280
adornments new outfits and and other

187
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,320
cosmetic items just for playing the game

188
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,659
now this is a relatively small content

189
00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:42,919
update but as long as we continue

190
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:44,180
rolling out patches like this

191
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,070
occasionally I think this could breathe

192
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,300
some new life of the game and I've

193
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,770
already seen a lot of players said

194
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:49,880
they're going back to the game to try

195
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,500
out this content I might very well do

196
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,449
that on stream as well so if you were

197
00:05:53,449 --> 00:05:54,949
somebody who purchased this game and

198
00:05:54,949 --> 00:05:56,960
still have access to it every somebody

199
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,520
who got it through game pass you can go

200
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,500
try the new content I recommend that you

201
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,389
do the game was fun just light on

202
00:06:02,389 --> 00:06:04,520
content this is just a little bit more

203
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,229
content but it's promising if they keep

204
00:06:06,229 --> 00:06:08,150
adding stuff like this now this week's

205
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:10,190
video is sponsored by the folks over at

206
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,960
better help so if those you've been

207
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,070
following for the last year you guys

208
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,840
know that I need all the help that I can

209
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,460
get when it comes to therapy after the

210
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,349
divorce after the gastric bypass I'm

211
00:06:18,349 --> 00:06:19,580
dealing with depression I'm dealing with

212
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,800
my anxiety it's been a heck of a year so

213
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,940
a couple of months back I saw another

214
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,620
youtuber advertising better help and I

215
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,090
reached out to them and I started using

216
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:28,130
their service and I was so pleased with

217
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:29,509
their service I asked them if they would

218
00:06:29,509 --> 00:06:31,039
sponsor the channel two major reasons

219
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:32,900
I'm using better help and the first is

220
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,539
price it is so much less expensive to

221
00:06:35,539 --> 00:06:37,520
use than it is to see if somebody in

222
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,969
your local area and if

223
00:06:38,969 --> 00:06:40,739
you needs financial assistance they can

224
00:06:40,739 --> 00:06:42,029
help you with that by reducing the price

225
00:06:42,029 --> 00:06:43,799
even further and the second is

226
00:06:43,799 --> 00:06:45,269
convenience because it is so difficult

227
00:06:45,269 --> 00:06:47,039
for me to schedule time to leave the

228
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,079
house to go wait in an office to visit

229
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:50,339
somebody for an hour just to come back

230
00:06:50,339 --> 00:06:51,809
when the folks have better help is like

231
00:06:51,809 --> 00:06:53,489
having a therapist in your pocket that

232
00:06:53,489 --> 00:06:55,259
you can reach out to at any time you can

233
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:56,999
schedule a phone call you can schedule a

234
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:58,799
Skype call you can work with your

235
00:06:58,799 --> 00:07:00,839
therapist 24 hours a day and it's really

236
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:02,610
fantastic they keep in mind if you are

237
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:04,409

238
