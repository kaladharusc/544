Remember this kid?

30
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,020
Hm? You still think, you're not convinced of our sponsor?

31
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,320
YOU THINK CALCIUM IS FOR SUCKERS?!

This is him after just one glass of milk.

33
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,660
Imagine what 10 glasses of milk will do

34
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:39,920
Don't even imagine it; your head might explode

35
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,580

have you ever experienced calcium

41
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,140
symptoms include

42
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,460
intense feeling of BONE

43
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,800

bones in urine, have you tried it

50
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,940
stop judging if you haven't tried it

51
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,380
I'm so sick of all you prejudiced commenters being

52
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:27,160
*high-pitched voice*

53
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,300
Stftfffktkfktfkkkk!

54
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,180
what are you gonna do, drink soy?

55
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,280
like a little soy boy

56
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,300
oooo soy boy alert

57
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,660
soy boy alert

58
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:40,340
this guy doesn't drink calcium, he drinks soy

59
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,240
pathetic

60
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,640
today's video is sponsored by mr. skeltal

61
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,180
thank you mr. skeltal for sponsoring this video

62
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,720
literally no one else will, but he reached out

63
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,380
his... helping hand

64
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,500
and it feels good

65
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:58,340
what a lot of people don't realize is calcium is metal

66
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,580
*doesn't know where he's going*

67
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,200
you got it

68

rest in spaghetti Pompeii never forgetti

69
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:10,480
that's right if you drink calcium your body will be preserved forever

70
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,540
how awesome is that?

71
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,380

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,600
oh right so

74
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,120
a lot people have been asking me

75
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,400
Felix, how did the universe get created?

76
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,780
well here you go

77
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:26,300
whom'st are you and why

78
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:31,140
mask you acquire calcium ion

79
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,540
milk element, such as this, is rare

80
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,960
commodity friend

81
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,280
I would- it would be unwise to challenge me

82
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,600
witness the potential

83
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,120

obsorb

85
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,260
and thus meme was created

86
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,740
remember there was time when the internet before memes

87
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:51,600
*no we don't pewds*

88
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,320

rattled everybody

113
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,120
how long is this meme gonna last?

114
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,240
it's almost like we can't even last through October for spooktober memes

115
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,480
they're already dead

116
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,360
undead memes are literally dying

117
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,640
that's how bad this is

118
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,720
the fact that no one has made a meme out of memes dying

119
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,960
is beyond me

120
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,580
cause that's the situation

121
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,860
we killed spooktober and calcium memes in one week

122
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,720
nice- nice work

123
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,220
*small clap*

124
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,140

have been judging... *clapping intensifies* meme review

126
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,220
this is not fair

127
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:25,020
just because I review the memes and explain the joke to a large audience of people

128
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,740
doesn't mean I've ruined the joke okay? (It does)

129
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:30,500
*sans agrees*

130
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,400
