Phoenix x-men is kind of gone where the

4
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:12,559

00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:15,839

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,240
together right now yep

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,939
three two one go you think you can fix

10
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:36,020
me you are not

11
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,600
you're not broken to you oh she's very

12
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,420
broke the mind there's a fragile thing

13
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:44,210
takes only the slightest tap to tip it

14
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:48,060
in the wrong direction

15
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:56,070
she's crazy

16
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:02,670
bald Pro and the hell's wrong with you

17
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,729
did you just kill your parents or did

18
00:01:06,729 --> 00:01:08,530
she make the car go that way or was the

19
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:14,700
parents arguing and without answers yes

20
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,440
do you think she's a good enough actress

21
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,530
to hold the film on her own I guess

22
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:22,450
she's not on her own everybody's showing

23
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:34,600
up take a sword that they recast

24
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:42,780
oh that's cool

25
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,670
was she trying to kill that guy right

26
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:48,549
bringing the helicopter blades - she's

27
00:01:48,549 --> 00:01:51,040
still talking over for copyright Fox is

28
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:57,909
super aggressive so it's cool to see all

29
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:59,890
the x-men back together they're using

30
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:01,390
yellow suits yo you don't like the

31
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,399
yellow Magneto he's been one of the rock

32
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,170
solid - ders good performances of these

33
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:13,269
I'm not really sold on Cyclops I mean

34
00:02:13,269 --> 00:02:33,120
he's just kind of there but that's just

35
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,690
I will it's crazy they drop the x-men

36
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,970
and now the only thing that remains is

37
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:46,450
this little X from from there so having

38
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:48,489
not seen the trailer I would have been

39
00:02:48,489 --> 00:02:50,410
worried about dropping the x-men title

40
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:51,820
but that's just a marketing move

41
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:57,310
honestly because you see they're all in

42
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,940
there so I guess maybe they want to you

43
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,200
remember a long time ago there were

44
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,519
rumors that they were trying to do these

45
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,260
like little character pieces like Oh

46
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,359
Magneto right and the whole movies

47
00:03:07,359 --> 00:03:10,120
magneto yeah they kind of did that with

48
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,890
Logan though I think it was it's kind of

49
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:15,160
its own thing but now I guess they're

50
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,720
getting back into it with Dark Phoenix

51
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,549
or they at least they're not naming so

52
00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:23,859
Jean Grey has never really been a

53
00:03:23,859 --> 00:03:26,410
character I've really cared about seeing

54
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,870
like yeah again she's fucking powerful

55
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:31,660
but right especially in her you know

56
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:37,060
Phoenix form but I gotta tell you I'm a

57
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:41,560
little mad on this I think I'm Li I am

58
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:47,930
more excited about Aquaman I think

59
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:50,180
okay these these actors in this one are

60
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,609
way better in terms of we've seen them

61
00:03:52,609 --> 00:03:54,019
before we've seen a mother movies we

62
00:03:54,019 --> 00:03:55,670
know Magneto's good we know this we know

63
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,709
that I love Professor X the young

64
00:03:57,709 --> 00:04:00,859
professor X I don't know I I just really

65
00:04:00,859 --> 00:04:02,959
don't care about Jean Grey and the Dark

66
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,489
Phoenix storyline cuz I know they're not

67
00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:06,349
gonna go intergalactic they're not gonna

68
00:04:06,349 --> 00:04:08,780
bring in the aliens remember those

69
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,040
little action figure I had with that

70
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,780
little scorpion guy forgot what the

71
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,579
Breen or something breathe or let's

72
00:04:13,579 --> 00:04:19,100
start record thing so I don't know boy I

73
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,419
think you got simultaneously a lot of I

74
00:04:22,419 --> 00:04:24,590
think what they're trying to do is is

75
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:29,479
you know sort of maybe capitalize off of

76
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:31,849
Wonder Woman and Captain Marvel these

77
00:04:31,849 --> 00:04:35,449
female lead superhero focused stories

78
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:37,099
and I think now Fox wants to jump on

79
00:04:37,099 --> 00:04:38,840
that as well and so that's why they

80
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,520
dropped the x-men and they're like you

81
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,470
know no more FINA its about Phoenix not

82
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:45,410
about the x-men it's about Jean Grey so

83
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:49,070
what happens here I don't know this

84
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:51,020
looks suspicious I mean her parents

85
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:55,580
what's going on maybe she's screwing

86
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:59,449
with the the thing that's a different

87
00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:01,580
scene though you think so okay like the

88
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:04,970
tile there's no way yeah that's tile and

89
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:07,280
he's the passenger not the driver so

90
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,550
he's not distracted I just I don't know

91
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,139
I don't know what's happening here we'll

92
00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:13,610
have to see whether you know they're

93
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:15,139
doing a little bit of subterfuge okay so

94
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:21,220
we got miss you know Hunger Games

95
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:24,919
Jennifer Lawrence as well without her

96
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:27,080
makeup cuz she's like oh please don't

97
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,639
put me in that make girl she's doing it

98
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,800
for seven hours I know she still she

99
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,199
gets on it later and Wow Samus is

100
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,800
looking all grown up now and we got

101
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,530
Magneto I'm most looking forward to

102
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:42,050
seeing the young team in action how do

103
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,990
they factor in do they attack her do

104
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:47,270
they well you know she's standing

105
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:49,849
opposite of them yeah probably trying to

106
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:54,030
locate her she's having trouble

107
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:58,000
she's just going off you know so that

108
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,800
aspect is actually kind of interesting

109
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,530
she's out of control and I hope this

110
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,950
scene turns into a fight between our

111
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:07,510
because that would be pretty cool I mean

112
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:09,970
this is classic x-men here and you have

113
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:13,030
who I think is storm right younger

114
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:18,040
versions of our heroes and then she's

115
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:22,040
just fucking with the military

116
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:26,700
[Laughter]

117
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,320
[Music]

118
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,390
you got powers alright why don't you

119
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,910
just quit quit quit crying about the

120
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:35,800
pout now obviously she's tortured

121
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:41,400
there she goes blue that was

122
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,960
Nightcrawler today yeah a night crawlers

123
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,490
in it every time I see him with this now

124
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:49,110
I just make sure you're ready player one

125
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:54,000
yeah you do you do it does player one

126
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,330
magneto gets a babe god I gotta bring it

127
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:00,190
back so you got to bring it back and

128
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:02,680
everybody's happy Magneto's is gonna be

129
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,630
the one to have to take her down and

130
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,220
they're like look we got to do things

131
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:09,060
our way cuz you you're fogging it up and

132
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:14,350
they kill her no I'm serious it's the

133
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:18,340
Dark Phoenix Phoenix's are born from the

134
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,919
ashes yeah so she dies it's super sad

135
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:23,710
but really she's just rising from the

136
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:26,599
ashes and you do this

137
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:29,179
and she's a completely different person

138
00:07:29,179 --> 00:07:34,909
hot as hell though okay so what's not

139
00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:36,800
excited about it but I think after the

140
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,800
trailer I'm more excited I'm not at an

141
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,409
oxide like you said I don't know turn is

142
00:07:42,409 --> 00:07:45,469
actually gonna be able to hold it on her

143
00:07:45,469 --> 00:07:46,039
own

144
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:48,919
yeah the cast is gonna be there but it

145
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:52,189
depends on how much they're gonna be a

146
00:07:52,189 --> 00:07:53,839
part of this movie this one is the

147
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:55,520
biggest questionable mark I think for me

148
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,189
another joke we're we're like are we

149
00:07:58,189 --> 00:08:00,439
kind of done with x-men I'm ready to see

150
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:02,330
kind of a reboot of x-men even though

151
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:04,669
Professor X and Magneto those are great

152
00:08:04,669 --> 00:08:07,249
keep those two and then give everybody

153
00:08:07,249 --> 00:08:09,649
their costume

154
00:08:09,649 --> 00:08:12,589
yeah I'm ready for it Hugh Jackman is

155
00:08:12,589 --> 00:08:15,169
Wolverine he's the best but we're I

156
00:08:15,169 --> 00:08:17,389
think we're ready for you no we're not

157
00:08:17,389 --> 00:08:19,909
ready to let go Superman yet we are

158
00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:20,719
ready to let go

159
00:08:20,719 --> 00:08:22,490
that's like Deadpool said we need a

160
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:24,619
younger cast somebody young enough to

161
00:08:24,619 --> 00:08:27,709
carry on the franchise breaking the

162
00:08:27,709 --> 00:08:30,289
fourth wall alright guys so our opinion

163
00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:32,630
a little tepid on Dark Phoenix are we

164
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,459
