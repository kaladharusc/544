1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,268
-Okay, I feel like we should
try and say the name

2
00:00:02,268 --> 00:00:04,137
at the same time to see
if we're, like --

3
00:00:04,137 --> 00:00:05,171
-I mean, that is some, like,

4
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:08,174
real, like, connection vibe

5
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:09,376
if we get the same name.
-Telepathic.

6
00:00:09,376 --> 00:00:13,279
-Okay, so...yeah.
-Three, two, one.

7
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:14,748
-Bobo.
-Robinson.

8
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:15,782
-Okay.
-Okay.

9
00:00:15,782 --> 00:00:16,683
Well...
-Bobo?

10
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:18,418
-Bo -- Like Rob --
-Bo.

11
00:00:18,418 --> 00:00:19,386
No.
-One of the same.

12
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:20,687
-One.
-Oh, no, wait. There's an &quot;O&quot;.

13
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:22,555
-Okay, great, great.
So, we're sort of, like,

14
00:00:22,555 --> 00:00:24,591
on the same wavelength.
Why? Why Robinson?

15
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:26,860
-I don't know. I just think
that's a cute puppy name.

16
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,495
-It is cute.
-Robinson.

17
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:29,829
-It is cute. I like it.

18
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:31,798
Okay, next. Let's see.

19
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:33,333
Oooh, oooh, okay.
-My God.

20
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,402
-Right. Three, two, one.
-Three, two, one.

21
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:36,269
-Chi-chi.
-Foxy.

22
00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:38,772
-Oh! I like Chi-chi!
I see Chi-chi for her.

23
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:40,774
-Isn't that so cute?
-Really cute.

24
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:43,276
-Foxy's cute.
-It's maybe a bit too sexy.

25
00:00:43,276 --> 00:00:45,879
-I feel like Chi-chi's
predictable, though, for her.

26
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:48,681
-Foxy Chi-chi. Like, a combo.
-Oh, my God, yes.

27
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:50,784
Double-vowel name.
-Let's do it.

28
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:52,419
-Okay, next one.

29
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:55,221
-Oh, my God.
-This is my dog.

30
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:57,323
I don't have one,
but this would be my dog.

31
00:00:57,323 --> 00:00:59,592
Like, I love kind of ugly dogs.

32
00:00:59,592 --> 00:01:02,162
No shade. Okay.
-Yeah, yeah, super cute.

33
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:04,197
-Right. Three, two, one.

34
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:05,131
-Martha.
-Cruella.

35
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:07,267
Martha?! I love Martha.

36
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:09,602
I have a friend called Martha.

37
00:01:09,602 --> 00:01:10,904
-Look at her haircut.

38
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,640
-I love it. She's punk.
-She's kind of cool, actually.

39
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,475
I'm down now.
-She's punk. Okay, cool.

40
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:19,412
We're into Martha/Cruella.
Martha's a better name.

41
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:20,580
-Yeah.

42
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,216
-Three, two, one.

43
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:24,384
-Joseph.
-Jean-Pierre.

44
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:25,318
-Oh, my God!
-Joseph.

45
00:01:25,318 --> 00:01:26,920
-Not that far off.
-&quot;J&quot; and &quot;J&quot;.

46
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,656
-I love Jean-Pierre.
Jean-Pierre takes the cake.

47
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:32,659
-It's just like I'm saying
this dog is, like --

48
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:36,663
He lives in Paris,
he smokes Marlboro Reds.

49
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:38,932
-Some dogs, I have to say --
I love dogs,

50
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,333
but some dogs annoy me.

51
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:43,403
-Oh, Jean-Pierre is annoying?
-He looks stuffy, like...

52
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:44,437
-Is it the hat and the scarf?

53
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:47,340
-Maybe the hat and the scarf.
-You don't like the styling.

54
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,409
Okay, I see, I see.
-Not for me.

55
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:52,278
[ Gasps ] Okay.

56
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:53,346
-Right, you know?

57
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:54,714
-Hmm, wait.

58
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:57,717
Hmm...
-This dog is mad.

59
00:01:57,717 --> 00:01:59,652
-Three, two, one.

60
00:01:59,652 --> 00:02:00,653
-Burt.
-Tank.

61
00:02:00,653 --> 00:02:02,422
-Like, one-syllable name!

62
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:04,624
-100% same vibe.
-Absolutely.

63
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:05,825
Tank you said?
-Yeah, Tank.

64
00:02:05,825 --> 00:02:08,461
-Yeah, I get it.
-Burt is cuter, though.

65
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:11,364
I like Burt.
-He's just, like, a solid dog.

66
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:14,968
-Such a [bleep] cutie.
-He's maybe a bit stupid.

67
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,603
-100%. Dumb as rocks.

68
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:19,739
-Dumb as rocks.
I love that expression.

69
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:20,707
But he tries really hard.

70
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:23,643
-Yeah.
-Like, he's, like, your BFF.

71
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:24,844
-So happy to see you.

72
00:02:24,844 --> 00:02:27,580
-Okay. Three, two, one.

73
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,581
Arnold.
-Marty.

74
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:29,616
-Marty?
-Arnold's better.

75
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:32,352
-I like Marty.
Like, this screams &quot;Marty&quot;.

76
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:34,621
Now you say it -- yeah.
-Marty, yeah.

77
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:37,757
What a cutie.
-Just a chicky-chappy.

78
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:42,262
Ohhh! Russian.
-Oh, my God.

79
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:43,696
-Okay, um, hold on.

80
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:47,967
I really need to
think about this.

81
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:49,536
It's got to be something chic.

82
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:53,840
Like...
-I'm gonna think of a person...

83
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,777
You know him.
I know him very, very well.

84
00:02:57,777 --> 00:02:59,279
...that he reminds me of.

85
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:01,548
I don't know
if you'll get it, but...

86
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:03,750
-Okay, well,
is it your boyfriend?

87
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,918
-Yeah.
-Yeah, okay, okay.

88
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:06,653
So, Jacob.
-Three, two, one.

89
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:08,354
-Jacob. Doesn't he
look like him?

90
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:12,525
-Yeah, I know what you mean.
I was gonna name this dog Vogue.

91
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:13,259
-Cute. Also,

92
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:26,000
Jacob's gonna love that.
-Yeah, right.
