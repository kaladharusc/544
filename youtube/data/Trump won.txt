107
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:54,270
I'm at an airplane right now watching

108

speech truck one i just wanted to

110
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,560
address that

111
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,030
everybody on Twitter is like what do you

112
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:05,550
think what are you gonna do first of all

113
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,830
I know a lot of my viewers are Trump

114
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:11,640
supporters so congratulations I entirely

115
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,130
respect the outcome of the elections

116
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:17,340
Trump won fair and square and and I

117
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,110
think the key thing to remember whether

118
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:21,180
you agree with him or disagree with him

119
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:24,120
is that the beauty and the most

120
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,370
incredible part again to live in this to

121
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:29,010
well live in that country live in this

122
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:31,410
country is that no one person whether

123
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:33,410
it's a politician

124
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:36,120
anybody else can really control how you

125
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,450
live your life so if you disagree with

126
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:42,900
our new president-elect then then it's

127
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,760
up to you to stand up for your values

128
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,310
and what you believe

129
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:53,880
all right that's it I'm getting there

130
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,850
I feel like I just didn't get down on it

131
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:00,240
I'm sorry this is the greatest office

132
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,470
building in New York City but I also

133
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,300
feel terrible for everyone who works

134
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:08,000
here that's not the three of us
