165
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,870
sure I know what that is I don't think I

166
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:48,820
pronounced it correctly however it's

167
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,580
that nasty fish or whatever it is some

168
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:54,250
cancer in a container and what do you

169
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:57,340
know it is it's got a fucking Rhodesian

170
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:00,040
Ridgeback howling at the moon as a logo

171
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,530
I don't like this sound like this one

172
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:04,720
fucking bit well I love fish so I'm

173
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,010
gonna go into this with an open mind

174
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:08,530
it's gonna taste just like pussy it's

175
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:10,090
gonna go all my room my room is gonna

176
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:11,950
smell like absolute AIDS for 10 weeks

177
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:14,290
straight this is a contamination problem

178
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:19,810
fuck fuck okay what I've decided to do

179
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:21,280
is I'm gonna stab the top of this

180
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,570
because I was working it with the pliers

181
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:24,280
for a while and I'm not getting much of

182
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,410
any progress it's I think it's under a

183
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:27,760
lot of pressure right now because it's

184
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,320
not giving me any it's giving me a lot

185
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,810
of fucking resistance so I'm just gonna

186
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:34,090
stab the top and then maybe I can push

187
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:35,770
it down and normal can't open it right

188
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:37,300
now I can't really can't open it because

189
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,350
it's it's bowed out so much all right

190
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:46,470
[Music]

191
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,220
that's rough

192
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,740
that's really fucking rough I mean I

193
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,830
knew it was under pressure but god damn

194
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,690
oh I wish you can smell what I'm

195
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:58,570
smelling ah this poor shirt it's it's

196
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:02,890
fucking done me well I love fish I love

197
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:06,130
fish the thing about any foreign cuisine

198
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:07,780
that you're a bit uneasy about you can

199
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:10,450
make the change to like it yeah I'm

200
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:12,460
convinced that it's very much possible

201
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,890
it's difficult is very difficult you

202
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:16,810
know if you see some crickets laying on

203
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:18,100
the ground you aren't gonna say all

204
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,570
those are extremely appetizing I want to

205
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:21,669
numb those up but if you see them cooked

206
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:23,830
up in the right way and you see people

207
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,750
eating them and you say man that could

208
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,760
be a treat then you can make it a treat

209
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,020
you should have to rewire your brain a

210
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,400
little bit but what if it smells like

211
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,229
shit what if what you're about to eat

212
00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:34,270
actually smells like shit you can still

213
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,560
make the change in your head you can

214
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,229
still associate the smell of shit with

215
00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:40,210
the taste of pleasure it happens all the

216
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:41,440
time yeah I'll be walking down an alley

217
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,410
I'm not sure if I'm smell Mexican food

218
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:46,120

219
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,769

220
00:08:47,769 --> 00:08:49,269
smelling this thing for good why little

221
00:08:49,269 --> 00:08:50,889
bubbling at the surface here I don't

222
00:08:50,889 --> 00:08:53,290
like it that much but I think I can make

223
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:55,089
the change Stromberg

224
00:08:55,089 --> 00:08:57,129

227
00:09:00,939 --> 00:09:03,459
pastrami in my book I love to see that

228
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:06,670
gray paste jostling around there as I

229
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,829
try to open it other unboxings they'd be

230

236
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,500
have to cauterize it

237
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:36,639
it's nut smells good so what I've been

238
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:38,259
doing is I've essentially just been

239
00:09:38,259 --> 00:09:41,819
tonguing the stromberg like this and

240
00:09:41,819 --> 00:09:45,970
tape tasting it like that it's extremely

241
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:48,910
ass it like not acidic it just it tastes

242
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,709
like poison I don't think I might throw

243
00:09:50,709 --> 00:09:53,350
up didn't have much to eat today

244

McMuffin there's actually not even any

solids in here just a fucking puddle of

247
00:10:01,089 --> 00:10:03,939
shit it's like someone just said what

248
00:10:03,939 --> 00:10:05,759
would be the worst thing to eat ever

249
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:08,319
diarrhea in a can that way when you're

250
00:10:08,319 --> 00:10:10,779
opening it with your shaky hands and you

251
00:10:10,779 --> 00:10:12,910
smell the fucking rotting stench of

252
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:15,399
diarrhea you don't have the luxury of

253
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:17,769
not spilling it all over yourself while

254
00:10:17,769 --> 00:10:19,630
you're fucking opening it also it's

255
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:21,699
really great for transporting across the

256
00:10:21,699 --> 00:10:24,009
world so that erupts like a geyser when

257
00:10:24,009 --> 00:10:25,839
someone wants a fucking opening forget

258
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,059
waterboarding and playing Radiohead it

259
00:10:28,059 --> 00:10:31,029
really loud volumes give the inmates at

260
