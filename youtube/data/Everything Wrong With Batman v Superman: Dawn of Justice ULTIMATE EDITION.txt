2
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:10,139
well you want it you got it

3
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:11,670
let's see if this Ultimate Edition makes

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,170
this movie better in any way is it

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,900
shorter it is not shorter ah welcome to

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,430
the party gentleman loan just so you

7
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:18,840
know there's still gonna be some absurd

8
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,730
leaps and logic unexplained coincidences

9
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,800
and continued overacting in this edition

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,449
but glad you're here we've made it to

11
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:25,769
our first difference in this movie where

12
00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:27,390
we get to see Bruce's mom's face a lot

13
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,010
better in one shot thank God the shot

14
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:30,510
was restored so that the redundant

15
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:31,980
Bruce's parents get murdered scene could

16
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,360
confirm that this asshole is about to

17
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,829
shoot her in the chin luckily Bruce

18
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:36,180
Wayne is here to make sure this one

19
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,070
easily seen kid gets back into the buddy

20
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:38,550
line

21
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:40,050
The Ultimate Edition shows us the school

22
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:41,160
children to explain that there was a

23
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,540
field trip which is why there's a random

24
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:43,680
girl standing in the middle of a

25
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,149
dangerous building collapse later but

26
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:46,559
there are two teachers here one at the

27
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:47,760
beginning and one at the end of the line

28
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,500
and they can't do a simple headcount yes

29
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,090
things are chaotic but apparently they

30
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,199
prescribe to the Child Left Behind

31
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:54,989
program Africana taste the feeling you

32
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:56,399
know what hereon always says were on

33
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,379
assignment together not a goddamn thing

34
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:02,460
I like hearin so far Jimmy Olsen simply

35
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:03,780
introduced himself and asked how she

36
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,250
landed this interview he hasn't been a

37
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,200
jackass or insulted Lois in any way but

38
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,400
here he is getting cut out of the movie

39
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,689
before Warner Brothers gets a chance to

40
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:10,350
do it themselves

41
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,150
your fixer said that the general lapew

42
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,280
photos this line is included in case you

43
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,659
needed more evidence that the bad guys

44
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,430
are even bigger assholes when they later

45
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,170
smash Jimmy's camera they did not tell

46
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,270
me the interview was with a lady man

47
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:22,740
what's up with this fucking fixer does

48
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,420
he communicate anything with anyone he

49
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,860
must be a random mechanic that everyone

50
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,270
just assumes can arrange complex

51
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,710
international media encounters with

52
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,390
rebel killers who basically throwing

53
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,009
stuff I saw what I had tonight by this

54
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:33,600
point in the theatrical release Jimmy's

55
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,189
camera is already smashed watch these

56
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:36,930
two movies side-by-side and you go back

57
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,900
in time why the fuck what a clandestine

58
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,820
Drecker beacon beep this loudly or at

59
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,040
all stand down as an order how do you go

60
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,840
from a vapid military drama to an

61
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,909
oversea GI doomsday in three hours or

62
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:49,649
less stick around the ultimate edition

63
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:51,180
clears the air on whether or not the

64
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,280
stood for dudes during this gunfight is

65
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,840
there even anybody in this tank it's

66
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,770
just a park tank

67
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:57,689
right maybe it's sabotage I have no clue

68
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:00,030
but explosions you are clear to engage

69
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,770
you know if Superman had arrived a bit

70
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,990
earlier and just saved Lois and the CIA

71
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,130
went ahead and blew the hell out of the

72
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:06,479
village there wouldn't be any reason for

73
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,129
the Senate panel to investigate Superman

74
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:10,170
so Lex is extremely lucky here with the

75
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:11,700
sequence of events which is really this

76
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,970
whole movie also

77
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:14,680
talk about Lex's plan he somehow knows

78
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,480
Louis is going to interview an African

79
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,040
warlord knows the CIA is involved

80
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,020
somehow inserts his own men into the

81
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,730
situation knows that Superman will show

82
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:23,230
up knows that he can implicate Superman

83
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:24,610
when things go wrong if he was this

84
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:25,660
smart he should have won already

85
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,700
drone the Superman yeah the CIA was

86
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,410
about to bomb this entire village I

87
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:30,730
assume at least one person saw the

88
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:32,080
missile headed there and heard the

89
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,030
gunshots beforehand but everybody can

90
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,740
blame him Supes for whatever reason they

91
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:36,760
should be thanking him for saving

92
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,470
everyone else's life Jesus is fuckin

93
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:43,000
movie ultimate edition of moody contains

94
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,860
ultimate edition of Amy Adams acting

95
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:47,580
solely through her face he came down

96
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,380
then came fire now it makes a lot more

97
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:50,830
sense

98
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:52,420
Superman is being accused of burning all

99
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,100
those bodies which we didn't see in the

100
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,600
theatrical release we're still not

101
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,830
removing us in because they still

102
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:58,180
somehow find a way to blame Superman

103
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,040
based on one person's testimony a person

104
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,810
they never vet once metropolis state

105
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,580
also more exciting football action as

106
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,720
can only be brought to you by the

107
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:10,150
ultimate edition yep it's all I ever

108
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,560
hear about Gotham City their football

109
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,120
fandom erupts in violence worse than

110
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,130
vancouver after hockey loss zack snyder

111
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,690
drops a reference to another comic book

112
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:19,330
movie that he honest to god this cop

113
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:21,280
climbs more stairs in this version can't

114
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,810
make this stuff so this guy is still

115
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,010
running an underground sex trade

116
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:25,780
organization right do we give it what

117
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,269
happens to him more blood more wine more

118
00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:30,489
precoital looks also our rated ultimate

119
00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:32,410
edition still gives us a pg-13 naked

120
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:34,360
Lois Lane is rich old ladies then if I

121
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,980
was very cute you know write checks for

122
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,959
Lex I know this extended scene is to

123
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:39,190
fill some backstory about Lex's

124
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,660
relationship with his father but it

125
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,100
really only gives us a few more seconds

126
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,660
to be disappointed in Jesse Eisenberg's

127
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:46,420
performance look him in his eye and ask

128
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:50,170
him how he decides which life's count it

129
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,760
makes way more sense for Clark to be

130
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,959
seeing something that actually matters

131
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,910
to his story rather than some nonsense

132
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,410
about Batman branding people so you

133
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:57,850
should hate him like the theatrical

134
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:59,739
release dip still if you watch these two

135
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,330
versions they made Clark react the same

136
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:03,070
way to Batman's branding as they did to

137
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:04,480
this lady's testimony about the stuff he

138
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,610
allegedly did the cake is a lie what was

139
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:07,959
the direction here Henry we're gonna

140
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:09,400
show something on the TV you just stand

141
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,799
there and emote underdog dreams dashed

142
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:13,840
ten yards between Gotham and glory

143
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,100
wait the only football game that was

144
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,419
added to this edition was the blowout

145
00:04:16,419 --> 00:04:18,400
when metropolis state beat Gotham City's

146
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,440
64 to nothing how is that ten yards away

147
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,980
from anything she

148
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:24,980
and she's been gone in fact if she's

149
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,930
smart and she got out of this city how

150
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:28,400
long has it been since the Nairobi scene

151
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,960
we just saw in Louis getting back

152
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,430
yesterday but the woman from the village

153
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,570
has had time to say goodbye to her

154
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:34,430
village after the Americans left and the

155
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:36,140
government attack and she's had time to

156
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,580
move to the US appear in a Senate

157
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,380
hearing in DC rent an apartment then

158
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,000
move out I just up a winning lottery

159
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,590
ticket for an unnecessary bat sketch

160
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:44,740
benefit for the library of Metropolis

161
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,820
someone on the committee requested that

162
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,830
Clark Kent cover it and newspapers give

163
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,120
stories to reporters based on the

164
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,980
requests of random people beside doesn't

165
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,660
he have football to cover also assuming

166
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,190
Lex is the one that invited Clark how

167
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,600
the does he already know that Clark is

168
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,010
Superman there may be some logical

169
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:59,540
explanation but it's in neither of the

170
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,160
cuts of this movie so that fake-ass

171
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,890
knowledge no bourbon Kentucky girl like

172
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:05,150
yourself even though we got plenty of

173
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,410
evidence the senator is from Kentucky

174
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,330
this edition which is ultimate by the

175
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:10,220
way requires this clumsy exchange to

176
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:12,050
drive it home maybe one day that'll come

177
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,870
back if I just keep everything the same

178
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:16,580
hmm and a silly movie makes a ham-fisted

179
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,500
attempt to explain that Lex has daddy

180
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:22,370
issues far but see that past Rafi is

181
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:24,410
that Clark asked this question even

182
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:25,850
though we now know he spent extra time

183
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:27,380
investigating in Gotham where Bruce

184
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,420
Wayne is ridiculously super famous we

185
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,710
said it before we even knew that so now

186
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,270
let's double it good people living in

187
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,950
fear and the bullshit theatrical release

188
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:35,930
you didn't get this Ben Affleck smirk he

189
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:38,090
bulled theatrical release never seen a

190
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:39,980
model like this Jena Malone is here to

191
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,660
deliver a line that Louis repeats later

192
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,250
in the theatrical cut experts at the

193
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,170
Pentagon can't ID it and is thus

194
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:47,180
adorably unnecessary gotta ask why even

195
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,380
bother casting her in this for two

196
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,790
scenes sure you don't know that it's

197
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:51,110
gonna get cut out but it's two scenes

198
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,370
and it's not like everybody's looking

199
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:54,020
out for a Jena Malone cameo this makes

200
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,580
way more sense in the Ultimate Edition

201
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,290
Batman's been branding lots of criminals

202
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,580
whereas in the theatrical release he

203
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,140
branded one guy that everybody decided

204
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,490
to jump to conclusions that the bat

205
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:03,260
brand was a death sentence in prison so

206
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,400
we'll take us in off because of this

207
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,050
version but the theatrical version still

208
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:08,180
is clearly becomes too this movie tries

209
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,620
to sneak in another watchman reference

210
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,360
by speeding past it but I drink your

211
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,070
Easter Egg movie or something like that

212
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:15,500
what the do you want seriously one

213
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,210
f-bomb you could have totally given a

214
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,170
fuck in a pg-13 cut I can't even piss

215
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:22,130
stand-in out well at least the

216
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:23,330
screenwriters got to throw in some more

217
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:25,030
pissed dialogue you'll take care

218
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:27,820
good so wait is this version of the

219
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,260
movie saying that this guy is ordering

220
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,790
people with the bat brands to be killed

221
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,770
in prison for walking reason but Batman

222
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:34,150
began branding people did he

223
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:35,590
coordinators efforts with this dude who

224
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:37,420
works for Lex I just don't know why that

225
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,770
brand puts you at the top of the list

226
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:40,510
for shipping that's all oh no some dick

227
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,010
had died let me decide from the red and

228
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:44,770
blue costume and I don't know fact that

229
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:46,390
he has one third of the USA's initials

230
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:47,140
on his chest

231
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,390
I like Jon Stewart but does that mean

232
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:51,670
one third of the USA's initials who

233
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:54,190
gives it it's the sword of Alexander

234
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:56,050
ultimate cut gives us more footage of a

235
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:57,880
description of a fake artifact I applaud

236
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,260
the theatrical edition for cutting the

237
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,790
scene down by adding three more to this

238
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:01,750
bloated position

239
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,280
some people say this isn't a dream

240
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,540
sequence because it doesn't show Bruce

241
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,800
falling asleep but there is no

242
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,270
indication whatsoever that these are

243
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,860
potentially real events and he's shown

244
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,660
waking up after that scene and the flash

245
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,160
scene any reasoning like that after the

246
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,020
fact is just excusing this silly attempt

247
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,280
of putting out of place fanboy

248
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,570
wish-fulfillment into a completely

249
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,040
different movie even if it's not a dream

250
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,300
sequence it's basically that Thor

251
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,860
nonsense from age of Ultron so it's

252
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:23,230
simplest no the mark all over cards

253
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:25,990
don't care that's the judge yeah but is

254
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:27,580
he working with the bad guys remember

255
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,170
it's the guy who works for Lex who's

256
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:30,640
commissioning these bat brand Shang

257
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,230
Kings in prison what is the origin story

258
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:33,640
of the bat bran becoming an instant

259
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,930
death sentence what does it supposedly

260
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:36,820
mean it's simple to make Batman seem

261
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,530
like a morally weaker superhero but has

262
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:40,180
no foundation for becoming a thing hey

263
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,500
Batman you don't want to double-cross

264
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,270
your prisoner killing partner do you so

265
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,500
far the only interesting differences

266
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,820
between these two versions are the

267
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,740
expanded CIA attack at the beginning the

268
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,360
different ordering of scenes and Clark's

269
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,710
better understanding of the bat Brants

270
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:52,180
even though technically they still don't

271
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,470
make sense in the store this right here

272
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:54,910
isn't one of those scenes does this

273
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:56,230
woman live in Nairobi or not

274
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:57,520
how is she a credible witness during

275
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,990
that CIA thing at the beginning of this

276
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:00,310
movie I don't know if they ever explain

277
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,420
why she looks like she's lived in the

278
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,010
greater Gotham metropolis San Jose area

279
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:05,080
her whole life also we're still on this

280
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,790
si story that no one cares about but how

281
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:07,930
could they know that he'd show up in

282
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:09,670
they still don't explain this in this

283
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:11,680
version Louis again cuts herself off as

284
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,390
if she's just realized Superman is drawn

285
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,680
to my blood like Edward to Bella in

286
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,060
Twilight but they never make that plain

287
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:16,870
anywhere

288
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,889
those are ensnared

289
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:23,039
for Superman oh no it needs to run now

290
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,629
Lois Lane who is supposedly a great

291
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,159
reporter thinks this is a story you can

292
00:08:26,159 --> 00:08:27,629
just run without proof she's been using

293
00:08:27,629 --> 00:08:29,430
committee is this puppet theater okay

294
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:31,020
then why not call the meeting off you

295
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,579
know Lex has been several steps ahead of

296
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:34,199
you and you know how dangerous he is

297
00:08:34,199 --> 00:08:37,199
you see him right there I'm sure nobody

298
00:08:37,199 --> 00:08:39,000
saw that and subways have zero cameras

299
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,079
you can get away with anything down

300
00:08:40,079 --> 00:08:41,519
there another scene where Supes is

301
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,050
moving extremely slowly relative to his

302
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:44,670
abilities is this really the right place

303
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:45,690
to take your sweet-ass time

304
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:47,279
ultimate edition now with a hundred

305
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,110
percent more alfrid manual labor also

306
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,670
after that Capitol building explosion I

307
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:51,779
really wondered what alfred thought

308
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:53,370
about all this now my wish is granted

309
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:54,810
there was a sin before about not seeing

310
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:56,370
Batman breaking Alec's Court now that we

311
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,720
get a brief glimpse of how awesome that

312
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,579
break-in was I'm adding 10 more more

313
00:08:59,579 --> 00:09:01,260
things going into things more sweaty

314
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:04,260
workouts Alexander Luthor your security

315
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,000
override has been accepted in the

316
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,470
theatrical release I just assumed they

317
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,910
cut out the part where the ship decided

318
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,500
to accept Luthor's override but the

319
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,880
addition of ultimate no still doesn't

320
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,290
explain it to completely mess bhaisaab

321
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:16,139
why is Clark walking exactly can he just

322
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:17,579
fly at the top of the mountain is he

323
00:09:17,579 --> 00:09:18,810
trying to prove something burning

324
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:21,269
calories inside of the chair is like a

325
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,980
celeb we didn't send the fact that Supes

326
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,089
didn't see the bond in the first

327
00:09:24,089 --> 00:09:25,829
go-around but since this edition finally

328
00:09:25,829 --> 00:09:27,089
actually explained something helpful

329
00:09:27,089 --> 00:09:29,519
I'll remove one sit still simple sir

330
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,790
phones the Hoff Wayne this line was cut

331
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,139
for time one of the advantages the

332
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:35,790
Ultimate Edition has over the theatrical

333
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,740
release is more Nancy Grace and more the

334
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,480
Lois kidnapping that's the shot in the

335
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,220
arm this movie needs again this movie

336
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,389
does nothing to explain some of the

337
00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:43,589
biggest questions of the movie how

338
00:09:43,589 --> 00:09:45,630
Superman knows when Lois is in danger no

339
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:47,100
matter where he is in the world Lex

340
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,480
knows the identities of Superman and

341
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,310
Batman how Lex knows how to operate the

342
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:51,449
Kryptonian ships computer functions

343
00:09:51,449 --> 00:09:53,399
stuff I think an extra 30 minutes is

344
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:54,750
more than enough to explain especially

345
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,190
since most of the additions in this

346
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:57,660
movie have wasted time on extra lines

347
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,279
more violence and that cop climbing the

348
00:09:59,279 --> 00:09:59,819
stairs

349
00:09:59,819 --> 00:10:01,500
it also doesn't explain this so the rest

350
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,120
of the movie either guys not making this

351
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,490
up but this movie adds 12 extra seconds

352
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:06,779
to its runtime so we can see this

353
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:08,760
asshole walk farther more like Ultimate

354
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,810
Edition am i right

355
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,850
there is more Batman V Superman in this

356
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:13,410
Batman V Superman but it's stuff like

357
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:14,880
this he didn't get enough suddenly

358
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,230
fruitless punching in the other version

359
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:18,000
now here's even more suddenly fruitless

360
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,220
punching wha I don't think we've given

361
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,079
enough since for the scene like in

362
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,029
2046 when we're all long dead from the

363
00:10:24,029 --> 00:10:25,529
Martian volcanoes sacrifice the

364
00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:27,360
electrons in the air will sense the need

365
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,010
to sin this idea that made it past

366
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:30,360
someone's brain and on to a screenplay

367
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,220
and then pass multiple other brain

368
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,720
were actually got filmed edited and

369
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,030
released to the public sir your office

370
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,410
no sir

371
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:39,660
you don't this version touches more on

372
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,040
the romantic relationship between Bruce

373
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,990
and Alfred an area where no other Batman

374
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:44,010
movie has dared to tread

375
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,300
we're moving once in for the obvious

376
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,770
homosexual relationship that this movie

377
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:48,000
makes no big deal about the way it

378
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,270
should be

379
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,920
or Batman kicking ass and the best scene

380
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,290
is always a good thing but this mph has

381
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:54,030
me befuddled I haven't seen one thing in

382
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:54,960
this movie that would make it aren't

383
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,400
rated for violence there's no way this

384
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,350
is worse than your average pg-13 movie I

385
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:00,810
don't hate the center I hate the sin Lex

386
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:02,430
Luthor's philosophy is too dangerously

387
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:04,230
close to our own ubi does explain what

388
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,520
happened to Martha after Batman saves

389
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,810
her which is good because I was

390
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:08,010
beginning to think the Batman made her

391
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:09,390
walk home if anything this version

392
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,950
raises more questions as to why certain

393
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:12,480
things are cut and why certain ones are

394
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,100
not here's a shot of Perry looking out a

395
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,630
window that saves four seconds when you

396
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,020
cut it

397
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,340
I mean someone actually said we need to

398
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,960
lose this the brass needs an extra four

399
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,620
seconds guys

400
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,940
this probably got cut because it looks

401
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,710
stupidest while we were dumbfounded that

402
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:24,060
Superman didn't just throw the crypto

403
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,440
sphere instead of flying directly into

404
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,420
doomsday I'm even more dumbfounded now

405
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,920
that the spear didn't weaken Superman

406
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,700
enough to the point where he

407
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,230
crash-landed before being able to do

408
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:33,210
that more Superman faked death morning

409
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:35,400
oh this explains Lex Luthor's he is

410
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,560
hungry moment well we'll remove a sin I

411
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,870
guess why did they cut this still even

412
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:41,310
after he sets up the Batman fight then

413
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:42,960
unleashes doomsday Lex has time to

414
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,520
interact with an even badder batty

415
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,530
forget arresting this asshole just take

416
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:48,930
him out now Chili's ready what Kennedy's

417
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:50,820
dead food borne the lowest staring at

418
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,570
the ceiling scene

419
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:57,390
stays in seriously watch the theatrical

420
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,650
version against this version side by

421
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:00,300
side and the bagpipes start playing row

422
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,740
row row your boat they said it's all

423
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:04,020
taken care of by home animist owner

424
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:06,770
Bruce paid for the funeral pretty badass

425
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:11,610
civilization on the way matters down

426
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:13,770
looking how just show me any moment in

427
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:15,210
either of these two editions when Lex

428
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:16,590
figures this out apparently his

429
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:17,940
superpower is to just casually know

430
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,040
everyone's secret identity I refer you

431
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,590
to transfer Arkham Asylum in Cabo

432
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:24,210
no one's ever escaped it so it's a

433
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,100
perfect place to put you also great now

434
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,390
he can interact with the other super

435
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:28,560
villains for the convenience of this

436
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,130
universe

437
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:30,990
wait a minute is this burial still going

438
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,790
on didn't we see Bruce here in Kansas

439
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,260
when they dropped off the coffin then he

440
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,610
went to tell Lex Luthor what's what and

441
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:41,459
now Louis is still here

442
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:44,900

443
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,680

00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:11,920
really chopped wood before but certainly

449
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,199
looks like fun then what better way to

450
00:13:14,199 --> 00:13:15,730
make your grand entrance on the streets

451
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,980
