1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,159
what's up ladies and gentleman of

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:03,899
YouTube's boogie2988 coming at you lavas

3
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:05,370
again through the power of the Internet

4
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:06,600
and this is my rambling series does my

5
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,160
vlogging series which I just talked to

6
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:08,760
the camera

7
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,230
talk about life talk about the universe

8
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:11,070
talking about things that are

9
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,269
particularly interesting to me today I

10
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:15,059
want to talk a little bit about YouTube

11
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:17,310
in general the Francis videos what I

12
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,100
have planned for YouTube and Francis I

13
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,119
want to talk a little bit about the

14
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:22,710
boring stuff monetization is and views

15
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:23,850
and stuff like that because I need to

16
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,529
get it off my chest for the people who

17
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:27,119
do care about it then I'll talk about my

18
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,670
mental in my physical health including a

19
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,260
weight update which I don't think you're

20
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,149
gonna be too terribly happy about

21
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:35,219
because I wasn't too terribly happy

22
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:38,010
about it but we'll get into that so

23
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,379
let's start off with the Fran Friday

24
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:43,050
with Francis experiment for Friday's in

25
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:45,450
a row and the videos have done very very

26
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,789
well I'm very surprised they've done

27
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:49,829
well in terms of views when it comes to

28
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:52,320
money they are making no money somehow

29
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,329
YouTube has not given them the D

30
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:56,520
monetization signal yet they earn zero

31
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,230
dollars I don't know if it's because I

32
00:00:58,230 --> 00:00:59,399
swear on the video I don't know if it's

33
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:01,289
the Francis keyword I don't know what it

34
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:03,149
is but let's say I've it uploaded the

35
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:05,909
video that got 200,000 views that video

36
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:09,180
would normally make me $200 that's just

37
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,040
a ballpark assisity I'm just guessing

38
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,600
here it could be more it could be less

39
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,729
depending on the video a Friday with

40
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:17,580
Francis video that is at 200,000 views

41
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:22,770
might earn 20 or $40 $60 next to nothing

42
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:24,689
it's the same amount of work or more

43
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:26,250
work for less money doesn't matter

44
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,420
though because let me tell you why

45
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,189
you're enjoying when watching them and

46
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:31,290
I'm joined making them even if it takes

47
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:32,869
the whole channel even if it means

48
00:01:32,869 --> 00:01:35,310
monetization across the board just dies

49
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,259
if one in every three videos I upload

50
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:38,820
which is the current rate for Francis

51
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,640
videos gets zero money incoming as long

52
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,049
as you're enjoying them that's fine now

53
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:44,909
if you want to do me a favor watch the

54
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:46,079
other videos to get uploaded in a week

55
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,790
the gaming news specifically this is the

56
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,220
sponsored videos by watching those by

57
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,540
interacting with the sponsors you make

58
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,880
sure that I continue to be successful

59
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,979
here on YouTube while bringing you the

60
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:57,180
content that you want to watch but if

61
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,329
all you do is watch the Francis videos

62
00:01:59,329 --> 00:02:00,840
that's ok too

63
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,490
I'm just glad to have you here and I

64
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,439
have a glad I have an excuse to create

65
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:06,810
again but a lot of you guys said and I

66
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,489
felt we needed to bring back the

67
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:10,170
narrative the problem is the sister

68
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:11,370
character got written out if you haven't

69
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,950
seen the Francis abandoned by his sister

70
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,540
you should watch that one because it

71
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,300
explains all that and she's gone and the

72
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,709
actress that played her has gone my

73
00:02:19,709 --> 00:02:22,280
ex-wife so I got together with my friend

74
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,760
Jacob who is David in the Frances world

75
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,989
and we filmed a narrative it's on this

76
00:02:27,989 --> 00:02:29,370
hard drive right now shakes on the hard

77
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,830
drive for this camera right over here it

78
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:34,110
will go live probably this Friday maybe

79
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:36,660
next Friday not 110% sure but we are

80
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,120
going to tell a story of kinship between

81
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,019
David who is also had his heart broken

82
00:02:42,019 --> 00:02:45,810
and in Francis and in a recovery so the

83
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:47,340
first video is like a classic Francis

84
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,900
rage flipping tables destroying stop

85
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,330
breaking cameras stuff like that but I

86
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:53,280
think as we go on the formula is going

87
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,360
to change we're going to tell a

88
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,519
narrative with this we're going to tell

89
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:57,599
a story and try to make the videos

90
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,220
longer and make them nicer and more

91
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,790
enjoyable and more fun it's something

92
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,319
I've wanted to do for a really long time

93
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,760
gives me a reason to come back to

94
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,170
Francis and don't worry they'll still be

95
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:08,790
plenty of rages and table slips of stuff

96
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:11,130
that'll always be part of it but I want

97
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:13,560
to do something creative with YouTube

98
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,599
again I don't think it'll get a lot of

99
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,980
views I think it'll get half the fuse of

100
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,290
Francis reg Classic rage would get it

101
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:20,400
won't go viral

102
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,930
it won't do as well but for those of you

103
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:24,180
who love the character and love me

104
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,280
you'll enjoy what we create and if it

105
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,959
gets 10,000 views so it gets 50,000

106
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:29,430
years that's plenty

107
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,889
that's plenty because here's the thing

108
00:03:30,889 --> 00:03:32,850
YouTube is made sure it's not gonna

109
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:35,010
bring in any money either okay so as

110
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:36,900
long as you guys are enjoying it I'm

111
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,440
enjoying him so let's see that's the

112
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,549
other thing I wanted to talk about when

113
00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:43,260
it talks to money and algorithms and

114
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,150
stuff like that it looks like YouTube is

115
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:48,540
just on a downward turn right now twitch

116
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,760
seems to be doing great and I throw so

117
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,139
you turn into my twitch streams thank

118
00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:53,370
you for doing it I know they've been

119
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:54,959
very weird in the past we're trying to

120
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,639
clean them up and make them more fit for

121
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:57,540
human consumption

122
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,250
if you checked my twitch channel before

123
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,200
check it again I think you'll like the

124
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,299
positive changes we've made that said

125
00:04:05,299 --> 00:04:07,200
YouTube seems to be taking a downward

126
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,639
curve even keen stars up there saying I

127
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:10,079
got the third of the last views last

128
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:12,120
week all kinds of gaming channels I love

129
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,290
someone we're quitting some remember

130
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:14,069
going bankrupt

131
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:15,959
I don't know what it is this channel is

132
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:17,880
suffered to some extent views are lower

133
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,760
I blame myself I blame my content I

134
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,490
blame my consistency I blame my whiney

135
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:26,610
nature I blame the stupid things I said

136
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:27,570
on podcast

137
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:29,220
Twitter I blame that as the mass

138
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,650
majority of it but it is hard to not see

139
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,210
that there's something algorithmically

140
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:35,610
or YouTube why it happening and I will

141
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:36,870
complain about that from time to time

142
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,490
I don't really complain about view

143
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,170
numbers or ad revenue I don't like to

144
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:41,070
complain about this stuff I will

145
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,840
occasionally fall into that because I'm

146
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,540
a narcissist we all are but here's what

147
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,040
I hear here's what I will complain about

148
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,600
when it does seem to be site-wide and

149
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,520
it's not just affecting me but it's

150
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,020
affecting a lot of the channels I like

151
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,000
to watch every day that's when you're

152
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,350
really going to hear me complain because

153
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,960
I worry about so many creators that I

154
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,240
love so many big companies that create

155
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,140
content I love I don't know it's so it's

156
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:07,230
it's it's frustrating but I guess I knew

157
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:08,460
that eventually the YouTube bubble would

158
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,350
burst I thought my personal bubble would

159
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:12,480
burst long before it if it bursts along

160
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,640
with YouTube hey that's not a bad

161
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,160
problem to have we will see but I'll

162
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,210
keep you abreast of that it'll probably

163
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:19,980
be as a single video talking about that

164
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,780
as we discover exactly what's going on I

165
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,550
think it's just people went back to

166
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,500
school and you guys are real busy so if

167
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,300
you made time to watch this video thanks

168
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,970
for tuning in so mental health and we'll

169
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:31,740
say the the weight update for the final

170
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:36,240
run mental health I saw a new therapist

171
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,010
and I'm getting into pharmaceuticals

172
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:40,160
we're now on my third week of a new

173
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,390
medication as I said I still see the

174
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,620
folks over better help one of my

175
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,630
sponsors for the channel and they deal

176
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:46,950
helped me out quite a bit in fact I

177
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,180
might link them here in the description

178
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,460
box below if you want to check them out

179
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,600
they are great to have on my phone all

180
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,070
the time but they were the ones who made

181
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,630
me recognize I probably needed more

182
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:55,860
intensive therapy and I needed

183
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,320
pharmaceuticals so I've gone back to to

184
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,630
work on that process it's nice to have

185
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:02,010
that in tandem have somebody in my

186
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:03,870
pocket and then have a therapist that

187
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:06,330
I'm saying once a week as well I've seen

188
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:08,340
her once she referred me to a colleague

189
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,500
who might be better fitting to my needs

190
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,150
we'll see how that's going but if I seem

191
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:13,770
more positive this week if I seem more

192
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:15,390
positive on Twitter if I say more

193
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:17,910
positive on stream that's why because

194
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,770
I'm feeling more positive I'm beginning

195
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:21,960
to see the light at the end of the

196
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,690
tunnel and I'm pleasantly surprised by

197
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:26,810
that I'm pleasantly happy about that

198
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:30,780
it's a good problem to have I don't know

199
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:34,470
I don't know everything in my life to

200
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,510
some extent I've lost weight I live in a

201
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:37,800
nice house I have a good income and I

202
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,090
have a job I love that those things are

203
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:41,310
all wonderful this stuff is still pretty

204
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,990
scrambled up here and if I can ever get

205
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:47,760
this to match all of this I'd be leading

206
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,050
one of the best lives I think a person

207
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:51,930
could live I'm looking forward to that I

208
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:53,790
am looking forward to that enjoying

209
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:56,280
these last you know 20 years 15 10

210
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,140
however long I have left on this planet

211
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,540
and then that leads me to the weight

212
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,310
loss update so as you guys remember I

213
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,150
broke my arm

214
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,310
and when I broke my arm I did something

215
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:07,230
stupid I went back to some level of

216
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:09,990
comfort foods but I waited to tell you

217
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:14,760
that today because I put on about 12 to

218
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:18,120
13 pounds once I broke my arm and I have

219
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,310
now lost that 12 to 13 pounds I'm back

220
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:24,030
to 360 and losing thanks again to doing

221
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:25,860
a low-carb Aikido genetic diet which

222
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,560
seems to be the way to go now in the

223
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,690
next few days I'm changing things up a

224
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:32,400
lot I'm going to be streaming a lot less

225
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,720
on Twitch because I have stuff I have to

226
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,760
do I've got a real life project that I'm

227
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,860
working on that shouldn't affect the

228
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,420
YouTube schedule in fact you should get

229
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:42,150
bonus content as I'm working on that

230
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:43,380
stuff because I'm going to film it and

231
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,790
show it to you and hopefully you guys

232
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:48,240
will enjoy what I'm creating there but

233
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,940
that's in an effort to get moving to

234
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,070
eating better to doing something more

235
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,270
creative something that will help my

236
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,350
mental health something that'll help my

237
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,180
physical health and I can't wait to

238

248
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:25,830
