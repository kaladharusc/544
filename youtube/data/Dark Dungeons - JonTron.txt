mission now every young boy in Nebraska

5
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:49,900

6
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,270
down there

7
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,620

11

fear-mongering is almost complete

12
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,170
there is but one more young boy we must

13
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:14,520
capture to tell him the tides of war

14
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,320
you don't mean it's too risky we don't

of style from reefer madness back in

23
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,479
1936 warning us of the dangers of the

24
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:05,640
demon drug marijuana to the Red Scare

25
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,860

00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,380
me to today's subject the chick track

36
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,299
for those of you that don't know which

37
00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:50,100
chick tract is a short evangelical

38
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,840
literary work created and published by

39
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,720
American publisher Jack T chick in short

40
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,100
they're a bunch of brief comics that

41
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,200
warned about the folly of man and how to

42
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,079
best avoid God's wrath but sounds silly

43
00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:03,269
enough but this guy is prolific selling

44
00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:06,060
over seven hundred and fifty million

45
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,549
tracks via his publication gosh be

46
00:03:08,549 --> 00:03:11,430
damned man that's a lot of Jesus Jack be

47
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,380
nimble Jack T chick Jack be right in the

48
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,269
pile of shit you know I'm saying okay

49
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:17,940
one track though was meant to stand out

50
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:22,319
among the rest the one the only the 1984

51
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,440
publication of dark dungeons this one

52
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,609
dealt with the dangers of playing

53
00:03:26,609 --> 00:03:29,190
Dungeons &amp; Dragons and the satanic

54
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,079
inclinations of those who worship the

55
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:33,750
20-sided die I mean come on let's talk

56
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,040
some sense all right we all know how

57
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,390
dangerous Dungeons &amp; Dragons is

58
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:41,220
among the tabletop gaming community dark

59
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,050
dungeons became something of a cult

60
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:45,480
classic a cultural bookmarker of the

61
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,519
lengths that people would go to demonize

62
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,489
a simple hobby so what's this I have

63
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:52,080
here you may ask well I'll tell you

64
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,910
apparently a group of film makers

65
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:56,519
acquired the actual legitimate rights to

66
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:58,080
make a film adaptation of the dark

67
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,440
dungeons tract and yes Jack T chick put

68
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,110
his stamp of approval on it himself

69
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:06,450
what else do I gotta say it's gonna be a

70
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:10,319
good one and let's go oh and there it

71
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,049
goes 200 damage to my DVD player for

72
00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:17,160
reading the data on this goddamn disk so

73
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,739
our film begins as a secret council

74
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:21,359
discusses how it has been plotting to

75
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:23,250
bring more and more innocent youths to

76
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,639
the dark side evil will reign and we

77
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,760
will bring it forth in the flesh

78
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,410
astrology and tarot card sales are

79
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:33,510
pulling more and more young people into

80
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:36,810
the dark woods world politics are

81
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,639
steadily progressing toward our

82
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,550
one-world government and I left an

83
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:43,830
episode of Bill Nye the Science Guy on

84
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:50,039
three separate people's TVs I am excited

85
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:52,169
to announce that this year more people

86
00:04:52,169 --> 00:04:55,289
have decided to be homosexuals than ever

87
00:04:55,289 --> 00:04:56,430
before in history

88
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,950
oh yes the dark magic has been

89
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:01,860
especially strong this year gays ok

90
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,320
popping up left to right if we can

91
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,020
corrupt just a few more Souls at this

92
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:10,410
College then the stars will be right and

93
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:14,460
when the stars are right oh shit he will

94
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:21,470
awakened and rebel across the world

95
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:26,640
deity will give you a then you'll go to

96
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,010
hell with all the Catholics and Jews and

97
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:33,570
play Magic the Gathering with Satan so

98
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:35,490
here we meet friends and protagonists

99
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,890
Debbie and Marcie - devoutly Christian

100
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:39,330
girls who find themselves on a new

101
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:41,250
college campus together ready to explore

102
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,080
college life and spread the good word of

103
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,400
the Lord they head to their college

104
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,930
orientation and watch a film on a

105
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:47,490
projector that's as outdated as the

106
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:50,730
beliefs presented in this film hey who

107
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:56,040
are those people those are the RPGs at

108
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,810
this juncture were introduced to the so

109
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:00,240
called RPG years in this world they're

110
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,120
the cool kids on campus mm-hmm very

111
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,550
factual they're Marcy and Debbie are

112
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:07,950
instantly allured we've been trying to

113
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,960
get them to thrown off campus for years

114
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,419
but they're just too popular

115
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:17,510
what's an RPG you don't need to know

116
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:21,330
yeah I kind of do though but ignoring

117
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:23,250
Mike's warning against engagement with

118
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,050
this radical group I've seen a lot of

119
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:27,960
students trying to dabble with RPGs not

120
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,500
one has ever stopped the girls set off

121
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,510
to the fraternity of role players in an

122
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,950
attempt to convert some of the players

123
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:37,110
to a different way of thinking or so

124
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:39,960
they say come on you've got to socialize

125
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,080
I guess you're right if we don't go to

126
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,280
this party you and I would be spending

127
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,050
all Saturday alone together in our dorm

128
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:47,700
room and how much fun could we have

129
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:52,620
doing that not much I guess how much you

130
00:06:52,620 --> 00:07:16,700
could do there what could go wrong

131
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:20,720

132
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,640

137
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:45,530
role-playing world hydration is

138
00:07:45,530 --> 00:08:07,700

152
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,580
a couple of chickens to go their entire

153
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,920
lives without experiencing the unrivaled

154
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,620
thrill of an RPG that's their business

155
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,240
we're not chicken then prove it by

156
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,250

157
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,140
from each of you and a picture of what

158
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,450
you think a chicken is just make sure

159
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:00,680

160
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,260
so the girls fall victim and the

161
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,700
mysterious lady who is definitely

162
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,040
college aged and the correct demographic

163
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,080
for role-playing introduces them to

164
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,250
their new alter egos you are

165
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,590
lack leaf the thief who is to the night

166
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:16,590

god we don't have to kill him do we

189
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:21,540
no you could show mercy to your enemy

190
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,040
and all that would cost would be your

191
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,560
gold and your weapons cold dead stop

192
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:32,280

195
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,760

196
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,790

197
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:50,209
take it take it take it

198
00:10:50,209 --> 00:10:52,879
you know it was it was all cool and good

199
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:55,459
but after that I just I don't think this

200
00:10:55,459 --> 00:10:56,350
could be the same anymore

201
00:10:56,350 --> 00:11:01,069
that was the best RPG I seen 15 years

202
00:11:01,069 --> 00:11:04,309
and I'm only 15 or at least that's what

203
00:11:04,309 --> 00:11:06,350
the crack in my brain made my brain say

204
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:13,309
to me what is this shit so the girls go

205
00:11:13,309 --> 00:11:15,050
home and sit on their beds dreaming

206
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,490
about the fun they had earlier in the

207
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:18,350
night all the while the dark council

208
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:20,660
schemes about their upcoming sacrifice

209
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:23,089
can I tell you something when I started

210
00:11:23,089 --> 00:11:25,579
casting spells in the game I felt

211
00:11:25,579 --> 00:11:27,980
something I don't know what it was I

212
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,809
don't even know how to describe it but

213
00:11:29,809 --> 00:11:31,939
keep on trying you'll get there strong

214
00:11:31,939 --> 00:11:33,679
so you know wasn't so hard was it

215
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:36,350
so after nights and nights of RPG

216
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:38,269
playing Debbie's teacher takes note of

217
00:11:38,269 --> 00:11:40,220
her failing grades you know when you

218
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,540
first started here I thought you're

219
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,829
gonna be one of the brightest students

220
00:11:42,829 --> 00:11:44,269
here but ever since you involved

221
00:11:44,269 --> 00:11:47,360
yourself in those wicked RPGs grades

222
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,649
have been going down steadily

223
00:11:48,649 --> 00:11:54,279
month-by-month RPGs aren't that bad

224
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:59,449
spells poison battles maiming killing

225
00:11:59,449 --> 00:12:02,749
yeah but it's all imagination is it is

226
00:12:02,749 --> 00:12:04,910
it Debbie well I suggest you read a

227
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,949
totally real book that has absolutely no

228
00:12:06,949 --> 00:12:08,689
poisoning maiming or killing in it

229
00:12:08,689 --> 00:12:16,500
called the Holy Bible

230
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,280
quit the RPGs Debbie it's your only hope

231
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,500
but predictably not heating your

232
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,390
professors advice she decides to go back

233
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:26,670
in for one final game and discovers she

234
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:28,860
is ready to receive the true power your

235
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,570
cleric has been raised to the eighth

236
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:33,570
level I think it's time you really learn

237
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:35,310
to cast spells do you think you're gonna

238
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:36,480
maybe back up a bit

239
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,950
I brought else start to become a

240
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:41,220
priestess and witch yes both of those

241
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:44,580
things for some reason wait hon that's

242
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:45,900
what our preaching does that's what it

243
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,880
gives you that's fucking awesome I gotta

244
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,990
get on there right now

245
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:51,480
so Debbie uses her newfound real powers

246
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,790
to get an A+ on her paper Oh and now she

247
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,800
dresses like Morticia Addams by the way

248
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,200
and some weird shit like this goes down

249
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,510

250
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:05,960
casting so delicate and small yeah

251

the same kick it used to have you know I

260
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,690

wrath of forever losing their privilege

to play RPGs with her no that would be a

279
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:28,150
truly unbearable fate you come across

280
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:31,300

00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:59,399
if you act you will be breaking

331
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:01,860
character oh god anything but that

332
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,989
so Debbie comes to the conclusion that

333
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:06,720
she must betray Marcie as not to break

334
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,730
her character and Marcie is declared

335
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:11,039
dead from the game Marcie get out of

336
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:14,029
here you're dead you don't exist anymore

337
00:17:14,029 --> 00:17:18,419
so just walk away my god this is gonna

338
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:20,010
be really awkward when they get home

339
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:21,970
into their dorm tonight

340
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:28,710
oh yeah that's awkward

341
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:31,750
yeah no like I mean you really didn't

342
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,950
this whole thing wasn't really a big

343
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:35,049
deal honestly it's my fault

344
00:17:35,049 --> 00:17:38,350
black Leif died I can't face life alone

345
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:41,830
so yes Marcy fucking actually hangs

346
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:44,350
herself over exiled from the RPG and

347
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:46,809
well fun fact about this frame it's

348
00:17:46,809 --> 00:17:48,370
actually ripped straight from the

349
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:50,320
original chick tracked right down to the

350
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,600
formatting and the font of the text now

351
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,270
that's how you do an adaptation take

352
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:58,030
note of that Dragonball Evolution you

353
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:00,429
fucking anomalous wretch in need of

354
00:18:00,429 --> 00:18:03,070
euthanization I can't get Marcy out of

355
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:05,679
my mind how could she do something like

356
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,809
this would have happened sooner or later

357
00:18:07,809 --> 00:18:09,880
all she was good for was reading the

358
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,000
Necronomicon and summoning the food oh

359
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,039
come on that's it that's all she was

360
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,409
good for being upset that she caused her

361
00:18:17,409 --> 00:18:19,570
friend to commit suicide as one does

362
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:21,669
Debbie gets even more fired up and plays

363
00:18:21,669 --> 00:18:24,039
right into the hands of mrs. frost so

364
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:25,900
logically she goes into the nearby steam

365
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,669
tunnels and starts casting spells at bat

366
00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:30,250
sounds and also she encounters a pupu

367
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:36,309
monster that tries to eat her oh I feel

368
00:18:36,309 --> 00:18:40,659
that why you just can't oh gosh the

369
00:18:40,659 --> 00:18:43,000
ghost of Marcy is back it's a miracle

370
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,360
it's your fault I'm okay even if that

371
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,340
were true little subtlety take you a

372
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:52,450
long way

373
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:57,540
I will Marcy I will

374
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:01,050
it's one big party and all your friends

375
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:01,950
will be there

376
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:04,410
oh yeah well that sounds an awful lot

377
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,300
like what a disguise

378
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:17,370
Satan would say hey Debbie what's wrong

379
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:20,010
well it's a bit of a long story

380
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:21,600
does your friend ever hung herself

381
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,460
because you killed her character and

382
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,620
Dungeons &amp; Dragons evil without end is

383
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,830
about to descend upon the works of man

384
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:30,990
and none of my RPG tome said the answer

385
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:33,060
how to stop it been there girlfriend

386
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:36,500
Debbie I told you Jesus is the only

387
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,630
answer using RPGs to fight evil will

388
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:46,410
never work because RPGs are evil Debbie

389
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:49,230
amen so now with the help of deus ex

390

JRR tolkien

402
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,750

heartthrob and you know it if you doubt

406
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,890
the occult nature of these books just

407
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:34,410
take a look here no kid should be going

408

00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:51,720
peer-reviewed study the better

415
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,240
help me so Debbie gives in to the power

416
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,220
of the Lord and asks to be absolved of

417
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:04,500
her inner demon you really want to lose

418

Emanuel he's pretty cool

425
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:25,019
now back at base the demon computing

426
00:21:25,019 --> 00:21:26,909
systems are going off the charts because

427
00:21:26,909 --> 00:21:28,620
Debbie renounced her role-playing

428
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:32,309
character the stars are no longer right

429
00:21:32,309 --> 00:21:34,470
why are the stars no longer right

430
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:36,299
systems are malfunctioning

431
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:43,040
John is clocking in at a whopping 319

432
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,140
I see Cthulhu nice to know you like to

433
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,550
see I haven't have any of you what the

434
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:49,130
fuck is this and so with that balance is

435
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:52,960
restored Wow holy crap

436
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,540
was that necessary okay and the film

437
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:59,030
ends how else but with a mass book

438
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:02,480
burning beautiful thank you boon for

439
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,750
setting me free

440
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,340
that is word-for-word how the comic

441
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,110
strip goes and it even makes mention to

442
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:11,630
the specific works of CS Lewis and JRR

443
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,430
tolkien which makes it so much better

444
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:15,170
that it's actually in the movie now you

445
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:17,060
can argue that this movie didn't take

446
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:19,640
this or these topics seriously but the

447
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,890
writer of the original work did and this

448
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:25,220
is a true adaptation so that makes this

449
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,590
movie legit and that's all that matters

450
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:29,900
to me so everyone thank you for going on

451
