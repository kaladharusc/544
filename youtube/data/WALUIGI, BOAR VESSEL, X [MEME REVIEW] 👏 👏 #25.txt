00:08:04,545 --> 00:08:09,075
 

173
00:08:09,075 --> 00:08:12,595
 

174
00:08:12,595 --> 00:08:15,585
Wow look at that 
5 people voted to get

175
00:08:15,585 --> 00:08:17,695
Waluigi in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate

176
00:08:17,695 --> 00:08:20,445
Everyone send this to Nintendo right now!

177
00:08:20,445 --> 00:08:23,275
And we can make an impact finally
Change.org

178
00:08:23,275 --> 00:08:26,685
Anytime I sign a petition, it actually happens

179
00:08:26,685 --> 00:08:28,605
The power of petitions guys!

180
00:08:28,605 --> 00:08:29,625
We have to show them

181
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:31,500
This

182
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,520
I rate this meme:
DEAD

183
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:44,120
&quot;I Don't Want to Set the World on Fire&quot; by the Ink Spots

184
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:52,680
 

185
00:08:52,680 --> 00:09:07,740
(swedish viking singing)

186
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,660
well this meme has sorta turned into the

187
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,380
&quot;What's the better soundtrack?&quot; meme.

188
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:17,600
(bad song)

189
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:27,480
(I Got Spurs That) Jingle Jangle Jingle by Kay Kyser
(the good shit)

190
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,760
Come on!

191
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,240
The New Vegas soundtrack (and the game)

192
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,160
mwahh

193
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,740
Beautiful!

194
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:41,760
(bad)

195
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,780
&quot;Big Iron&quot; by Monty Robbins
(good)

196
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:44,960
 

197
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,840
(laughs)
The fallout Vault 76

198
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,535
announced it with the &quot;Country Roads&quot;
yea-yea-yea-yea-yea

199
00:09:50,535 --> 00:10:06,295
yapity-dapity depity

200
00:10:06,295 --> 00:10:07,995
 

201
00:10:07,995 --> 00:10:16,205
 

202
00:10:16,205 --> 00:10:21,965
 

203
00:10:21,965 --> 00:10:24,835
Did I force this meme in enough for ya?

204
00:10:24,835 --> 00:10:26,515
That's right this meme gets a:

205
00:10:26,515 --> 00:10:29,445
SSS

206
00:10:29,445 --> 00:10:32,375
Alright next- or a the final thing

207
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:35,245
I just wanted to dedicate to

208
00:10:35,245 --> 00:10:37,385
XXXTentacion that passed away recently

209
00:10:37,385 --> 00:10:40,155
It was confirmed he was shot dead in Florida

210
00:10:40,155 --> 00:10:42,985
He was supposed to do this charity thing as well

211
00:10:42,985 --> 00:10:45,835
It's really heartbreaking
I found XXXTentacion

212
00:10:45,835 --> 00:10:47,465
Through memes

213
00:10:47,465 --> 00:10:50,415
He was sorta part of creating this meme rap

214
00:10:50,415 --> 00:10:53,085
movement where rap music would become popular

215
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:55,175
Through memes

216
00:10:55,175 --> 00:10:57,945
Obviously standing it's own ground but I think a lot of people

217
00:10:57,945 --> 00:11:00,345
found XXXTentacion through memes

218
00:11:00,345 --> 00:11:03,395
He sorta wore the punchline of a lot of memes

219
00:11:03,395 --> 00:11:06,435
With a very grungy, loud type of

220
00:11:06,435 --> 00:11:09,335
Overly

221
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,675
started from

222
00:11:10,675 --> 00:11:17,145
his type of music
Him and Bones

223
00:11:17,145 --> 00:11:17,865
 

224
00:11:17,865 --> 00:11:20,495
he gave a lot of great memes 
But most of all

225
00:11:20,495 --> 00:11:23,515
A lot of great music
Personally I really-

226
00:11:23,515 --> 00:11:25,625
Liked X
I thought his music was great

227
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:27,845
I loved a lot of his music

228
00:11:27,845 --> 00:11:30,765
he seemed- I know there was a lot of

229
00:11:30,765 --> 00:11:33,595
bad stuff around him
I don't want to just-

230
00:11:33,595 --> 00:11:36,565
ignore all of that, but also
i don't know anything about it

231
00:11:36,565 --> 00:11:40,155
Personally, I really looked up to X
I thought he

232
00:11:40,155 --> 00:11:42,855
was an inspiring artist
he took his own path

233
00:11:42,855 --> 00:11:45,675
He made his own moves

234
00:11:45,675 --> 00:11:48,545
Despite sometimes it would become memes
I still admired it

235
00:11:48,545 --> 00:11:51,555
I still thought he was really cool
And I really really liked, genuinely

236
00:11:51,555 --> 00:11:54,255
A lot of his songs
It's just awful

237
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:57,735
To see what happened
And I hope whoever shot him down

238
00:11:57,735 --> 00:11:59,785
Gets brought to justice

239
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:02,825
And we've even talked a little bit
I've spoken to him a bit

240
00:12:02,825 --> 00:12:05,075
And he wanted to

241
00:12:05,075 --> 00:12:07,255
Go on a livestream with me

242
00:12:07,255 --> 00:12:10,275
And I was too much of a pussy to even say yes

243
00:12:10,275 --> 00:12:13,265
And the final reason I wanted to bring it up on Meme Review

244
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:15,735
Is not because I wanted to

245
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,985
Meme it or whatever
It's moreyjngtjtyjyygfnjh

246
00:12:18,985 --> 00:12:21,885
I see a lot of people posting like
Super

247
00:12:21,885 --> 00:12:24,805
Edgy memes abyjytjtjout it
And it's just so cringy in my opinion

248
00:12:24,805 --> 00:12:27,815
I feel like i've expressed myself 
incredibly poorly about this

249
00:12:27,815 --> 00:12:29,095
 

250
00:12:29,095 --> 00:12:30,405
um

251
00:12:30,405 --> 00:12:33,875
But maybe I- I don't know
I just don't know

252
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:37,265
how to say it
Rest in peace X

253
00:12:37,265 --> 00:12:39,000
You will be missed
