Frankenstein's hands maybe scratch that

10
00:00:49,269 --> 00:00:51,100
last one yeah I don't think that's a

11
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,570
thing don't forget about this is a man

12
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,629
not the season well I didn't realize you

13
00:00:58,629 --> 00:01:03,460
were going to go ape shit stop clock

14
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,680
tower it's a series best known for the

15
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,659
game released on the PlayStation 1 but

16
00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:09,430
it actually had its start on the SNES

17
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:10,780
which most people don't know because it

18
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,490
was never released outside of Japan I've

19
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:14,409
always wanted to try it out seeing as it

20
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:15,909
is one of the earliest entries into the

21
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,860
survival horror genre some would say

22
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,840
this game pioneered survival horror but

23
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,970
can an SNES game elicit the same kind of

24
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:23,710
tear we associate with such titles as

25
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:26,619
Resident Evil and Silent Hill somehow I

26
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:29,310
doubt it

27
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:42,710
[Music]

28
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:46,850
o'clock towel that's not very scary Oh

29
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:48,210
God

30
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,580
raised in the granite orphanage Jennifer

31
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:53,940
and her friend friend Z ooh typos

32
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:56,520
already getting scary were wanted as

33
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,040
adopted daughters yes I'd like to adopt

34
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,840
the two of them like puppies from a

35
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,250
kennel after all

36
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,740
anything can be fucking sold for the

37
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,100
right

38
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:11,220
it happened in September a bit of a

39
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,780
missed opportunity if I'm saying so

40
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,519
myself I mean the scary monsters one

41
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:19,320
over oh that's the one from now on what

42
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,850
kind of place will we be living in

43
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:23,220
that's the fifth time you've asked yeah

44
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,450
well maybe it'd be the last time if

45
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:26,489
you're just fucking told me don't worry

46
00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:28,410
it's a very nice place we're almost

47
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:32,459
there see Oh

48
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:34,800
majestic yeah you know all that's

49
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,569
missing I think is just a big old sign

50
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:39,090
saying definitely not haunted I think

51
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:40,440
that'll be an amazing touch in

52
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,750
Clocktower you play as Jennifer Simpson

53
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,610
an orphan girl who has just been adopted

54
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:47,400
by a mr. barrows the story picks up as

55
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,900
you've just been brought to his secluded

56
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,090
and creepy mansion in the woods I gotta

57
00:02:51,090 --> 00:03:02,319
go get mr. barrows everyone wait here

58
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,310
do you think you can maybe give me an

59
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:07,370
ETA on that man this game sure is off to

60
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:11,959
a slow start oh no that can't be good a

61
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:13,849
musical change like that can only mean

62
00:03:13,849 --> 00:03:16,489
one thing I gotta get out of here ain't

63
00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:18,170
gonna be the first down so you have much

64
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:21,230
right now locked doors huh I don't know

65
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:23,030
where to go it's all wonderful the

66
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:23,870
lights went out

67
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,930
okay well I guess I'll just try to go up

68
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:30,739
these stairs even though it's gonna take

69
00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:33,920
my entire goddamn life okay yeah it's

70
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,310
nothing up here oh look at that turn the

71
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:40,010
lights back on it's almost like we got

72
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:42,470
somewhere I have to say for this era of

73
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,000
gaming there really was nothing with

74
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,099
this kind of intense atmosphere most

75
00:03:46,099 --> 00:03:47,810
horror competitors at the time are just

76
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,459
platformers or action games that had

77
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:51,860
spooky themes nothing quite got to this

78
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:56,180
level yeah what was it well I better

79
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,590
hurry and see what just made that blood

80
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:02,090
curdling scream oh no I was too late

81
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:05,120
maybe I should I ran the game works on a

82
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,799
courser system it's basically like a

83
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,630
point-and-click adventure I eventually

84
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,250
found out that if you DoubleTap she

85
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,510
starts to run which is nice because

86
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:13,220
otherwise I'd be walking everywhere like

87
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,410
that as you walk around the mansion

88
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:17,570
crazy events can happen at random which

89
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:21,169
keeps the tension high whoa okay

90
00:04:21,169 --> 00:04:22,760
guess I'm glad I was walking this time

91
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,130
honestly the lack of a direct input on

92
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:26,570
your character helps add to the feeling

93
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:30,289
of helplessness it's pretty cool ah yes

94
00:04:30,289 --> 00:04:32,150
there's nothing like a portrait of a

95
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,250
skull with no eyes to really bring a

96
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,080
home together this is actually a

97
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,160
original Vincent van ghoul people don't

98
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,100
come over anymore the game also brings

99
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,570
itself to life by showing really

100
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:46,250
detailed close-ups so the items you find

101
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,050
like look at this broken picture of

102
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:50,180
these two kids the artwork is fantastic

103
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,010
so much terror is portrayed through this

104
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:54,380
angle and lighting especially for 16-bit

105
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,630
graphics it's genuinely creepy we'll

106
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,580
just because I'm being haunted doesn't

107
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:12,410
mean I can't be beautiful

108
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:14,780
at least he had the decency to be

109
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,310
delicate you know I'm saying like some

110
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:19,220
ghosts nowadays too busy to float a

111
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:22,100
little old lady across the street I'm

112
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,170
sorry I I don't think I can get over

113
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:26,750
this yet he spins her around and gently

114
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,150
pushes her after he's done strangling

115
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:32,390
her and she just daintily Falls what

116
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:34,490
even well fine if you're not gonna be

117
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:36,350
nice I'll just have myself a refreshing

118
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:42,080
talk with the bird oh god no please you

119
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:47,570
say something I kiss you I kiss you I'm

120
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:49,730
near you I'll kill you

121
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:51,470
not now chop I'm trying to figure this

122
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:56,600
out Todd you miss me up dead from like

123
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,580
addiction I'm getting a bit sick of

124
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,170
these dead ends I just want the plot to

125
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:12,410
progress already

126
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:14,490
you know I'm having second thoughts

127
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:16,560
about this adoption I think I'll give

128
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,550
you guys a call

129
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:19,560
oh my god I am outta here but then again

130
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,090
that did look like a bit like Angus

131
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:22,290
Young but then again his signature

132
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:23,790
doesn't mean anything if I'm dead but

133
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,560
you know I'm a huge ac/dc fan so I think

134
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,910
I'm gonna check one more time just to

135
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:28,980
make sure it wasn't him what is this

136
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:31,710
person is this actually the main enemy

137
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:34,410
of the game after all this time all this

138
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:36,420
atmosphere and our nemesis turns out to

139
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,220
be Jay Leno on a schoolboys body with a

140
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,050
serious case of moldy prune face and

141
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:42,660
what's he using as a weapon exactly that

142
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,660
that that's hedge clippers we're not

143
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,360
getting around this Jason had a machete

144
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,880
Freddie had a curry pea claw hand

145
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,910
scissor man he's got scissors that's it

146
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:54,810
that's the end that's where it ends

147
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:56,640
Edward Scissorhands

148
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,670
this is Edward scissor man uh what do I

149
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:00,120
do

150
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,940
I better grab that shovel no wait get in

151
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,160
the car and get out of here no even

152
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:05,580
better

153
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:08,340
I'll hide up here ain't no way his

154
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,400
stubby legs are climbing up this ladder

155
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:17,850
that's right see you later buddy I did

156
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:20,100
not pack them in the warp ability all

157
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,230
right let's try this again this time

158
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:24,030
going straight for the car no messing

159
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:26,970
around the upstairs okay bad idea I can

160
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:29,400
see that now car made us steel let's go

161
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:37,500
but the others fucking as silly as he is

162
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,210
after scissor man hits the scene this

163
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:41,970
game becomes ten times as scary every

164
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:44,490
room becomes a trap every object becomes

165
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:47,160
a game of deadly trial and error he can

166
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,770
appear literally anywhere at any time so

167
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,419
you better be careful because game over

168
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:53,100
is back to the beginning like it is with

169
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,260
these old games that's gonna scarier

170
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:59,040
than the monsters other random things

171
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,760
can happen too okay well this is

172
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,380
unfortunate now I got to play the rest

173
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,150
of the game as Pig puns Pigpen for the

174
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:09,620
people of peanuts picked up some ham

175
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:13,300
this'll kill

176
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:16,990
it's a swimming pool actually that's a

177
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:19,420
window ah hole in the floor

178
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,220
we meet again I guess I'll just put this

179
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,280
simple wood plank over the top of it

180
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,040
just a simple plank of wood who are you

181
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,350
to judge with everything this game does

182
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:31,120
right it still suffers from a lot of

183
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,290
hiccups that old point-and-click

184
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:34,240
adventures do for instance like when you

185
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,650
think you figured out the solution to a

186
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:37,150
puzzle but the game has decided that

187
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:39,160
that is not the way the puzzle is gonna

188
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,230
be solved which of course leads to you

189
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,970
having to backtrack and put a piece of

190
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:44,380
ham in your pocket or something just

191
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:47,140
some obscure tiny object that you paid

192
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,540
no mind to all the way on the other side

193
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,400
of the map is the key to progressing

194
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,990
wouldn't it be funny if someone were

195
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,310
like hiding behind the drapes like it

196
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:55,930
was a horror movie or something all

197
00:08:55,930 --> 00:09:00,730
right really there Susan what are you

198
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:03,100
fucking seven actually I think you are

199
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,300
actually you are seven aren't you all

200
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,670
right checks out okay well maybe I'll

201
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,620
just see what's behind these drapes it

202
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:09,460
couldn't be worse than that

203
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:18,550
nightmare-inducing shit so can I start

204
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,170
therapy now or should I wait for the

205
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:22,420
nightmares to set in eventually you get

206
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,040
to the top of the clock tower and find

207
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,990
out the dance is Ehrman yeah yes by the

208
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:28,240
way his name actually is Dan really

209
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,460
hates the sound of tower bells in for

210
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:35,710
some reason listen even if you don't

211
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,360
like the sound of bells that was just a

212
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,480
very poor route to take also this lady

213
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,890
backs up the cliff because some birds

214
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:44,800
were bothering her yeah that's the story

215
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,280
folks

216
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,860
remember that powerful scene from Star

217
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:50,050
Wars where Emperor Palpatine backed off

218
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:51,430
into the nebulous void because he's

219
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:52,480
annoyed yousa Birds

220
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,160
I still cry

221
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:01,410

that was so embarrassed believed it was

224
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:10,420
real but it's all in the spirit of the

225
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,010
holiday I mean it's good to sit back and

226
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:13,690
remember that sisters don't actually

227
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:21,490

narrated by Campbell Scott and like I

246
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,820
said I got a second mouth to feed this

247
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,290
guy over here he's basically skin and

248

show you the true tear of Halloween this

250
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,470
guy at the store was labeled as pumpkin

251
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:57,680
with face I don't know about you but I

252
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,850
think there's a little bit more going on

253
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:06,000
here than pumpkin with face
