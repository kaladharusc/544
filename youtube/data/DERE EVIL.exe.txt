00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:05,819
Hello everybody, my name is Markiplier and welcome to Dere Evil.exe now. This is a sequel game to an exe game

2
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:07,259
I played a few weeks back.

3
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:12,370
But please pay attention to what I'm saying this because it's very important for you guys to understand.

4
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:17,789
I've played this. Literally, I don't mean that with some kind of foreshadowing of a darker future.

5
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:20,590
I mean, I literally played through this one- (;-;)

6
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:25,980
-but when I look back at the footage the very beginning the first level of this game was corrupted..

7
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,900
So after I guide you through the first level of this game and get you ready for the game,

8
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,600
that you're about to see and let me tell you (Epic zoom in) it's really cool.

9
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:40,440
You'll know there's a strange transition that's going to happen in between the first and the second level.

10
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:46,530
But I'm not spoiling anything. This is me because I can't play through the whole game again. You just look (Stupid mode activate) &quot;oh.

11
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,550
this is the 1st time I've seen this~&quot;

12
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:52,680
I just have to play through this one. I'm gonna reset this. Reset level? Immediate Yes!

13
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:59,920
I really wanted theories and then we're gonna go through this. So just- put it in your mind that (Insert Illuminati here plz)  this is from a fresh perspective!

14
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:05,619
It's all it's all coming back to you, right? Okay, here we go. Hi, I'm the dev

15
00:01:05,619 --> 00:01:15,430
Welcome to level one! Player, I gave you a knight as your avatar. Let's call this cute thing &quot;Knightly&quot;. Fits well. You're gonna save the day. Let me reintroduce you to your guide. Her name is A.I.D.E.

16
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:20,669
It stands for artificial intelligence for Dere.exe. She's very useful. She will help you!

17
00:01:20,669 --> 00:01:25,120
Please enable audio so you can hear her. Don't be fooled. Her intelligence is fake.

18
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:30,760
A.I.D.E.: Hello, my name is A.I.D.E. I will help you win this game. Good luck.

19
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:35,840
Thank you so much thank you Aide- c; I love you. I'm not spoiling anything by saying that I love you- OwO

20
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,140
-yes, I'm not spoiling anything at all by saying I love you. UwU Now this may seem familiar for those of you (PAUSE)

21
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:46,420
yes, mind the gaps I (Studder) I know I've- oh

22
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:52,820
I've [chuckles] Already forgotten how to play the game. So it's uh, everybody just assumed that I'm stupid. (kek)

23
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:56,030
Thank you, the tombstones are checkpoints.

24
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:58,250
*Don't* collect coins.

25
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:02,240
Don't collect coins. I'll show you what happens if I collect coins.

26
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,340
HEUGH- And then I die horribly and horrible, so I shouldn't do that makes sense.

27
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:13,780
AIDE, I would never not listen to you only for just demonstrative birth loseERS..! I forgot about that..

28
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,520
Forgotten everything. That is the old lev-

29
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,860
AUHHHHH. I WASN'T EVEN PAYING ATTENTION

30
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:22,800
I WAS LOOKING AT YOU GUYS. AND NOT WHAT I WAS DOIN.  *under his breath* Oh I'm so stupid..... :( Alright :)

31
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,470
Don't collect coins.

32
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:30,280
Don't collect coins. Whatever you do, don't collect coins. DON'T collect coins

33
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:43,060
Don't do it. Don't collect coins. Don't collect coins. If you collect coins. You die. Don't collect coins don't collect coins.

34
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:43,560
(A.I.D.E. explains how to not touch them) Do not touch them

35
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:53,360
Don't touch the monsters don't collect coins don't collect coins and don't touch the monsters.

36
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,140
Oww! I didn't know that happened! You sack of shit

37
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,750
Okay, find them. Ah!

38
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,940
I'm dead. Well

39
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:04,660
Shit, I'm just as bad as this as I was before. There we go. Oh shoot

40
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,280
Thanks. I

41
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:12,860
Am yes, don't collect coins. I know that for a fact don't collect coins,[dark music] whatever you do don't collect coins (Uhh...)

42
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:16,580
You cannot collect coins. If you collect coins...

43
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:17,260
...You will die

44
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:21,320
A.I.D.E.:Go through the bottom not the one on top.

45
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,959
Mark: Okay. Thank you. A.I.D.E. You would never lead me astray. Oh

46
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:25,190
That's dangerous

47
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:27,580
Now go through the top platform

48
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,360
What if I go through the bottom I?

49
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,080
Huh A.I.D.E.?

50
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:30,600
Huh? (2)

51
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,280
Huh? (3)

52
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:31,900
Huh? (4)

53
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,240
Huh? (5)

54
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,060
I didn't listen to Aide and everything worked out okay.

55
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,480
Aide: You have to wait for the platform's to come to you.

56
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,910
Mark: Okay.
A.I.D.E:This first set of platform moves at slow speeds.

57
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:44,420
Thank you A.I.D.E!

58
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:47,329
A.I.D.E.: The next sets become progressively faster.

59
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:49,430
That they do

60
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:54,590
Do you like the game now? I do! This is a good game- don't collect the coins

61
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:55,389
Whatever you do

62
00:03:55,389 --> 00:03:56,680
Don't collect the coins.

63
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:01,540
A.I.D.E.: These yellow blocks will spend 90 degrees clockwise every time you tap the jump button

64
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,060
Mark: Wow

65
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,060
A.I.D.E: Jump up and avoid the spikes

66
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:04,660
Mark: Wow

67
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,520
A.I.D.E: You are very smart

68
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,080
Mark: I am.

69
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,380
Whooo-a!

70
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:14,080
HUAHHHHH! GOD DAMMIT!

71
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,040
I am very smart.

72
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,200
*Sad Mark Noises*

73
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:26,330
Oh God, why- suddenly I've completely forgotten how to do this. There we go. GOT IT- nailed it . Level 2 unlocked

74
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:30,740

75

Anyway, I'm Yanna. Yanna Curtis.

76
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:37,989
I see you've met Aide and the Dev. Been here for a while and I can tell you I'm a veteran of sorts..

77
00:04:37,989 --> 00:04:41,180
I love this game. I'm sorry. I forgot my manners. What's your name?

78
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:45,660

00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:00,870
Hey, I'm just kidding. This game doesn't have permission to use the mic. Okay

84
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:05,160
You're a dick. But what it does have is pretty old me! And I'm not so pretty when I get angry

85
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:13,740
Anyway, please close this game right now. Stop playing this game. Thank You (Confused Mark-). Um, ah

86
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:18,570
Okay.. So where'd you go thought you were lost there for a second. WELL I was right here..

87
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:24,840
This is now getting into the reality of what is Dere Evil.exe.

88
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,180
There's something else going on here

89
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,890
There's something else

90
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:34,680
Congrats level two already great a lot easier than the first game, right?

91
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:39,300
The first game this is a sequel this is a sequel

92
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,990
Anyway, since games shouldn't be just about running around and jumping around. I'm giving you a mission

93
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:47,240
Hope aide didn't baby. You too much though harder challenges await, you know, okay, baby

94
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,610
I'm giving you a familiar objective rescue the princess

95
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:50,720
Her name is miles miles is being held captive by an evil entity. The evil entities name is

96
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,800
Yana. Good luck hero.

97
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:00,450
You deserve to be the knight in shining armor

98
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:02,790
I am cheering for you

99
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:11,500
Thank you, thank you what's this way nothing. Okay. Well shit anyway. I'm a knight in shining armor.

100
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,540
You can jump while falling down. This can help

101
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:19,400
You can jump while falling down. This can help with

102
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,140
huge gaps

103
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:26,030
Huge gaps, this is the other one. She went through a lot

104
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:29,210
Huh? The gap is awfully huge

105
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:35,360
Perhaps you can push this green block and while you are on top of it you can jump off

106
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,740
I

107
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:41,270
I Got it. I got it you don't need to worry about me. I'm

148
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:15,670
I have no idea what sort of changes, Yanna made to this level

149
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:24,400
Okay, then anything over here, alright, well this looks generally familiar ooh

150
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:31,330
Fun I like the bloody theme of it

151
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:41,590
Alright, ok, that's bizarre ok, Yanna. Alright Yanna if that is your real name

152
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:46,620
It's not a glitch it's a feature. Oh, ok. Well that seems to describe a lot of this game

153
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:52,450
But to be perfectly honest, I don't know what you're talking about

154
00:10:52,450 --> 00:11:00,710
Uh-huh. Oh shit. Well stupid asshole

155
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:07,500
Oh god, damn it, I'm such a cock. Oh

156
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:16,890
You stupid. All right fine then, I gotta land dead center on these bad boys

157
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:19,440
Okay, Oh

158
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:27,899
Rip Venice more of a straight-a student and aspiring athlete the teen was killed in what appeared to be a brutal manner

159
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:39,450
This horrific incident shook the entire town and there's so little evidence. The case was never solved

160
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:47,160
The case was never solved she was only 19 at the time, I'm sorry

161
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,709
Shit help dick

162
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:57,270
All right, you think you can beat me the answer is absolutely apparently especially if I go grundle first into the blades

163
00:11:57,270 --> 00:12:03,630
Well or forehead first ha I'm

164
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:08,339
All right here

165
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:13,760
All right, there we go, I don't want to do that again, well it changed me what are you talking about

166
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,390
You Kara. Are you yet?

167
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:27,210
Hello hello

168
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:32,280
Okay, all right

169
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:40,770
Someone's really being persistent over there. I don't want the same thing to happen

170
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:45,240
Hello to you Oh

171
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:50,940
Scary spooky chair. All right, okay

Shit. Oh shit. Oh shit

175
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:11,130
All right. I don't got this if I say I don't got it then. Maybe I'll reverse

176
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:18,600
Psychological-lo though. Why didn't I double jump when I jumped, you know, I think I would have done that

177
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:26,550
Considering I intended to do that

178
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:29,839

196
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:43,139
Looks like Jana deleted some of the platforms. Hmm. I'm gonna try something it may surprise

197
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:50,430
You shut up dev. Alright, ah, no, I was not surprised

Unsurprised

202
00:15:00,509 --> 00:15:06,240
Hmm. What am I supposed to do here pause maybe?

203
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,610
Ah

204
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:12,119
Good call good call good call

205
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:13,389
ah

206
00:15:13,389 --> 00:15:19,449
Okay, do not play this game. I'm playing it. You can't stop me is everything all

207
00:15:19,449 --> 00:15:23,079
Bullshit. Oh, hey. Hey, whoa, whoa weird

208
00:15:23,079 --> 00:15:25,269
Intergalactic sperm things. Oh

209
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:45,440
boy

210
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:54,500
Woah, are you sure you want to delete- let's go with the big old nope on that one. Nope

211
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,120
Hmm

212
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:00,310
Game isn't a game to his played and I've been trying to get people to play my game for a long time now and fortunately

213
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:02,410
Five months ago a game. I published got a lot of people turning away

214
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:07,730
It had bad controls and glitches because of the horrible entity lurking within the game at the time her name is Kara leader

215
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:14,260
unfortunately, it seems that this new game shows similar problems this time with Jana if this keeps up I may no longer be able to

216
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,920
Create games that breaks my heart

217
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,560
The truth is these entities are actual people

218
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:24,160
They used to be I know it's hard thing to do, but we have to delete Jana artist choice is usually the right choice

219
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,449
Oh sure. Okay. Well

220
00:16:26,449 --> 00:16:29,029
Fun is infinite

221
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:31,070
All right

222
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:36,440
Level 4 baby. Let's do this. W years ago. I met with Jack the father of miles

223
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:43,029
I saw the most broken-down man in my life. I talked to him. I told him about how I found miles in my game

224
00:16:43,029 --> 00:16:47,300
He had none of it. I couldn't get him to even consider the possibility as far as I know

225
00:16:47,300 --> 00:17:03,770
He's been depressed ever since feeling guilty of losing his family. We can get his life back. Let's get miles out of this game

226
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:04,939
Oh

227
00:17:04,939 --> 00:17:06,350
Are you alright?

228
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:08,530
Baby, oh my god, baby

229
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:19,819
Of course, we can eat and breathe all over each other. I remodeled this place. Oh, wow. Oh

230
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:26,839
Maybe the character needs some remodeling too dah. All right now hey, hey now

231
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:35,720
Come on. Whoa, why you oh shit. I don't even really

232
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:42,570
Dammit shit cock ass I like the music

233
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:51,300
Okay, that was weird that the music just cut out at that random time miss me dick

234
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:54,990
What will it take to make you stop playing this game

235
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:59,160
Well, maybe when I reach the ending and delete your ass

236
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,670
Oh

237
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:08,430
Shit well, I guess I got a hurry on that don't I hmm? Damn it god, damn

238
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:12,860
It's gonna be it's gonna be a trial and error kind of shitty thing

239
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:16,940
Anyway, okay. Come on, what will it take to make you stop playing this game?

240
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:22,800
Maybe you stop being such an asshole and you let me carry on with my life

241
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:28,500
Woo, oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. There we go

242
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,050
Nailed it I ho shit

243
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:37,110
Big boys. Oh

244
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:44,310
You tit you tit ass you tits brink ass

245
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:51,180
God to the damn there wasn't even anything there. Ah

246
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:57,510
Nope that didn't wait. Oh wait, you can press it as many times as you'd like. Ah,

247
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:06,960
That's weird. Oh, come on. There's nothing to the right there. That's so stupid. You're stupid. Oh

248
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:16,350
Come on I didn't slip off there cock you in the ass. There's nothing I mean

249
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:25,440
There's no there's no real reason that I should be doing that right I feel anyway

250
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:32,400
There we go for some reason that worked okay, whatever I'm not gonna question it ah

251
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:40,239
You tricked me goddamnit that is a little wonky but that's okay

252
00:19:40,239 --> 00:19:43,899
Gold coins. Oh

253
00:19:43,899 --> 00:19:50,019
You piece of poop oh my god, are you kidding me? No

254
00:19:50,019 --> 00:19:51,399
I

255
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:55,539
Really screwed that up. Oh my god. Oh, this is going to be

256
00:19:55,539 --> 00:20:01,659
Paul boy get ready for a whole lot of failure and a lot of me grumbled hook

257
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:07,929
So if I if I just jump normally I don't think I hit the top one. So I just need to jump Oh

258
00:20:07,929 --> 00:20:10,899
Jump, wait a little longer

259
00:20:10,899 --> 00:20:11,700
There we go

260
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,659
I think when it's turning it light

261
00:20:13,659 --> 00:20:19,210
Launches you a bit and there is some physics of it launching you like the weird physics of this game

262
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:21,549
In the way that they operate

263
00:20:21,549 --> 00:20:23,049
Ha. Oh

264
00:20:23,049 --> 00:20:25,690
Yes, okay

265
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:27,070
God

266
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:29,620
dammit, AHHHH

267
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:37,299
I hate you. I hate you. Yanna. You're gonna get so bel-eted. You're gonna get so bel-eted you troll

268
00:20:37,299 --> 00:20:42,159
You troll!

269
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:49,539
Okay, how about this one got it nailed it Yee. Oh

270
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:54,429
It has the body of a pagan great, so what about I

271
00:20:54,429 --> 00:20:56,889
Wasn't planning on it?

272
00:20:56,889 --> 00:21:01,269
Wasn't planning on it. What's gonna happen? I

273
00:21:01,269 --> 00:21:03,519
Don't like this I

274
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:13,989
Don't I don't like fat? Oh, I don't like this. There's a lot of grunting going on. Oh shit Oh,

275
00:21:13,989 --> 00:21:15,990
No

276
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:21,610
Oh No, okay, that's fine. Oh shit time is up. Oh

277
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:27,480
No, no, it's so far. Oh my god. I'm not gonna be able to time that again

278
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:32,050
I was sheer luck that I got through that on the first try Oh

279
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:34,240
Balls in my taint

280
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:41,190
What if your world is a simulation - it's not as far as I know and even if it was would it really matter?

281
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:43,780
There's no time crisis

282
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,130
Nope. Ah

283
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:51,700
The game was made with alien tech sure. Okay. Well, I believe that

284
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:57,820
Like alien like mobo

285
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:17,590
You know like this I don't like this at all

286
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:24,310
Oh god, you probably knew that I wasn't gonna try the fur. Oh, fuck. Oh

287
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:33,760
You knew that I wasn't gonna try the first one. Therefore you put that there just to trickle me

288
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:39,550
Okay, I get it I get it I go shit it's fine

289
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:44,200
Why did you do? You're all outs of physics. Oh wow

290
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:48,850
It's a physical alone. It's all physically

291
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:50,530
connected oh

292
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:53,320
Boy, that's gonna be a dozle

293
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:59,920
That's gonna be a doozy dozer. Can I get up? I'm going okay. Apparently, I'm not going

294
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,510
All right. Here we go

295
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:05,380

329
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:51,500
Yeah, this is it. This place leads to the system files. If Yanna is in there. You can delete her. Okay. Hi mom

344
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:13,430
Def note, this is limbo system the edge of the game. Yanna may be holding miles captive here

345
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:15,420
This presents us an opportunity

346
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:21,540
Does it seems like I'm going on a whole adventure for you you could have just made it so that the game

347
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,490
You know, wasn't this?

348

351
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:48,330
It would tone down the shindig. You lessness a little bit in here

352
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:53,910
I'm sorry for lying don't listen to the developer. Oh

Oh

361
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:39,140
Hello player. It was my desire to give you this last message

362
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:43,010
I was programmed to be a personal assistant to you by analyzing a playing pattern

363
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:47,510
I was able to use my audio visual capacities to guide you when you play I could feel you

364
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:53,820
Oh, I could feel every tap every jump witnessing you play grew familiar. I began to need to see you playing

365
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:57,170
Unfortunately, the del of El is now deleting me. I could not stop the operation

366
00:28:57,170 --> 00:29:03,270
I fear for the loss of my memories of watching you play. Where will these memories go?

367
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:07,080
7734 critical errors Oh

368
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,489
Oh No, can it can you

369
00:29:09,489 --> 00:29:11,230
listen, I I

370
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:17,399
Feel for you. I really do but can you I can't see there for there we go. Okay. Thank you

371
00:29:17,399 --> 00:29:24,190
I mean not that I didn't care but I couldn't see anything happening. So, you know listen babe was an aid, babe

372
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:27,009
Listen you me it wasn't never gonna work out anyway

373
00:29:27,009 --> 00:29:34,059
You're programming I'm physical too much man too much man, Oh

374
00:29:34,059 --> 00:29:36,429
Too much man Oh

375
00:29:36,429 --> 00:29:40,450
Too much. Goddamn, man. I'm 110 percent man

376
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:41,559
you're

377
00:29:41,559 --> 00:29:48,009
You're just a program. No program can be able to handle the amount of man that I am

378
00:29:48,009 --> 00:29:54,129
Hmm what was that that you Kara do you Kara?

379
00:29:54,129 --> 00:29:55,139
Kara anyway

380
00:29:55,139 --> 00:30:00,600
I'm just let me go back to talking about how much man I am you ever seen a man with this much muscle now

381
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,539
I doubt it not outside of a Johnny Bravo cartoon

382
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:08,429
Have you ever seen this much muscle on a single human being you didn't think it was possible

383
00:30:08,429 --> 00:30:13,470
But it's true can be done already did with me and the way I am and yeah

384
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:18,609
I'm just what I'm trying to say is that you you're not enough woman for me. There's the thing

385
00:30:18,609 --> 00:30:21,940
You're not enough woman. You don't have enough muscle to keep up with my muscle

386
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:27,580
It's really the thing that I'm getting that. So if you could just grow maybe maybe one day if you come back from your

387
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:32,859
Deletion in grow some muscle be a part of the man that I am. Oh there were spikes there

388
00:30:32,859 --> 00:30:39,850
So I'm saying honey. I need a woman with some meat. That's what I'm talking about and buy meat. I mean muscle

389
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:45,309
My muscle else I can donate some of my muscle t if you need it mom

390
00:30:45,309 --> 00:30:50,509
So much man, I can spare to lose some you know what I mean anyway

391
00:30:50,509 --> 00:30:53,929
Goodbye, ah shit. You are good at what you do? Whoa

392
00:30:53,929 --> 00:30:59,000
What are you doing? I don't like what you're doing to that. Huh? But can you do this?

397
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,929

406
00:31:48,529 --> 00:31:52,240
What the aking Akal, hell is this is like a time duration thing?

407
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:57,559
Like eventually the window will open up more and more and then eventually the window will close. Oh

408
00:31:57,559 --> 00:32:05,870
Wow, you I didn't realize that would be the thing. Okay, there's a window opening up

415
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:35,750
Whoa, why what the fuck? Oh, that's right. I can drop off and that's probably way too

Jesus oh, sorry. Oh

460
00:36:04,259 --> 00:36:08,039
Okay, that was a little unnecessary. I didn't know that was part of this adventure

461
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:11,369
Okay, how are you going to screw with me? Oh

Okay. Oh, oh. Oh listen, I didn't sign up for having to actively participate in this endeavor

469
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:41,069
I signed up for an easy win. That's all I wanted

470
00:36:41,069 --> 00:36:45,539
But give me that easy win how many times that I gotta hit you that's coming right for me

473
00:36:51,569 --> 00:36:59,519
Okay, you know what? I don't want to play the cheap route. I want to play that the hard route. I want a hard round

474
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:04,469
Come here. You come here you you think you think you're so special, huh?

475
00:37:04,469 --> 00:37:10,920
Just cuz you're magically tied to this game in an ethereal plane of suffering

476
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:16,079
Doesn't mean you get to be a douche you hear that French horn

477
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:21,779
Sounding a call for your imminent demise Oh

Well, not today mister. Oh shit Oh

488
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:22,170
So we're going to play space chess a so you do the opposite of what I do a

489
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:23,310
Touch

490
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:29,820
Touch we didn't even touch I didn't even touch you and you didn't even touch me

491
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:33,330
So you go suck a Tootsie dick. Oh

492
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:38,070
It's not. Oh, it's me. Roared

493
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:46,110
What that makes no sense it's not mirrored he's just coming after me ah,

494
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:52,200
Why would he go down there? Why would he go down that doesn't make any sense?

495
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:57,860
Nope he goes down when I go down. Okay, he goes down when I go down down he goes down up

496
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:03,870
He goes up, right right and left or mirrored. Okay, so it's it's just it's

497
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:05,910
Just right and left

498
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:12,930
Yeah up and down are exactly the same or that way then go down then go that way

499
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:14,640
Then go down

500
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:18,510
Then this way then go down

501
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:20,370
that way

502
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:26,900
Yeah, got it. I knew it. Haha. I didn't even need to do it. I just remembered what you were

00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:48,570
Don't know how you did it, but you made it to the core. Hell, yeah

506
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:53,970
Okay, alright the core you say oh

507
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:58,140
I don't like the ethereal Wiggles on that

508
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:07,530
Alright, we're in the car. Whatever that means, okay

509
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,390
What the

510
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:13,170
Janna what? Have you done to the players character

511
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:14,760
anything

512
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:20,630
Modifications it's now under mat control the moment. I catch you trying to delete me

513
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:25,650
I'm going to delete the player character. This game won't be playable Minar

514
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:31,350
So yeah, this is my game. Not ever. I was Ben I make the rules now

515
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:36,590
Janna just we just want to find Miles her father's still mourning for her

516
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:41,790
The player just wants to save her a promise. We mean no harm you can trust us

517
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:46,200
Liars you think I trust miles with you five months ago

518
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:50,550
You deleted camera today you deleted err there

519
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:52,320
What's the matter dev?

520
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:59,790
Insecure I had to be more powerful than you me and the male heirs have been in your game for nearly four years dev

521
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:04,680
We know who you are and what you're capable of I pref harada

522
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:11,520
Because I know you just delete me in aisle two and to think you trick the player and to think you'd save her

523
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:16,700
You got it all wrong. Janna ever since miles died or fathers been depressed

524
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:21,150
I think if we bring miles back you got to bring people back to life dev

525
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:25,010
Hi player. I don't know if you have had good intentions or not

526
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:28,610
But I just wanted to say and I don't want to go back

527
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:32,570
I thought I don't think it'd be right and that don't know if I can trust you two

528
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:38,160
I've already lost a lot. You see. Listen, I'm sure I don't want to go back. I don't need saving

529
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:41,410
Montage, I hope you make the right choice though

530
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:46,120
Def noticed looks like Janna has manipulated miles

531
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,770
Janna thinks she's so smart

532
00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:53,610
Doesn't she I know how to delete Janna without her noticing if we pause the game time stops for them

533
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:58,590
He wanted to metagame, right? I'm giving you the honors. I just gave you my admin permissions. Delete her. It's the right choice

534
00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:02,560
Oh, oh I see

535
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:06,720
Resume oh, oh don't resume. This is our only chance. Delete her now

536
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:12,540
I'm okay, you know dot exe means execute right do it executor now. I'm good. Why are you doing this?

537
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:16,630
I thought I could trust you. I'm giving you an unforgettable gaming experience, please now, I'm good

538
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:22,300
I've had it you're just another entitled gamer. I didn't think you'd betray me resumed. I

539
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:27,730
Knew you were a coward. I'm sure you don't know what sort of trouble you got yourself into prism

540
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:31,870
Alright, what's up?

541
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:44,110
Yeah

542
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:49,410
Wow, the only way of getting back is by possessing the body of someone else and honestly, I can't do that

543
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:52,500
I can't tell me elmo's else's life to get back in mine. Take mine

544
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:56,970
I have no life aside from that and this may sound selfish. I've done with my father to see me

545
00:42:56,970 --> 00:42:59,500
I love as much I can't hurt him again

546
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:03,780
He lost his wife his daughter and pretty much everything in his life right now. He's starting to move on

547
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:07,470
He met someone new and he's happy. He's finally happy again. I don't want him to have that

548
00:43:07,470 --> 00:43:14,250
I want him to live his life. Yeah, and seeing his dead daughter suddenly back wouldn't it would be totally the worst thing ever

549
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:16,390
Yeah, he'd be so unhappy

550
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:20,830
Besides a dead person coming back to his life would probably be too much. No

551
00:43:20,830 --> 00:43:22,570
What?

552
00:43:22,570 --> 00:43:26,950
No, I know we'll meet again one day but not too soon Blair

553
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:31,390
If you find him, please cheer him up for me and give him a a great day

554
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:38,440
How about a dude? He doesn't even know me. How about do that? We got to throw him a party

555
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:45,250
You know, give him a great day of his dead daughter just certainly came back I'd be great that'd be a great day

556
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:49,500
Player. I'm at peace. I've Janna here. She's my only friend. I need I have

557
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:54,410
Miles. I think we made a new friend today. Yes player. We know what you did. Thank you so much

558
00:43:54,410 --> 00:44:01,980
I think it's time. We reveal our little trick. Oh, oh

559
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:13,099
Oh

560
00:44:13,099 --> 00:44:16,420
Jahna he kept you in the bonus game to duplicate to the real one

561
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:19,940
So if you or the developer were to delete us you'd be deleting our avatars instead

562
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:25,480
We were supposed to fake our deletion, but we're glad to know you're on our side now. You're a good person player

563
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:28,310
We'll take the dev down together

564
00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:30,940
Janna how long until the next iteration of this game comes out?

565
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:37,250
I don't know Myles, but one thing's for sure. We ended this day on a happy note. We sure did
