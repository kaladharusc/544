Let the games begin.

25
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:18,040

26
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,590
Okay, um...

27
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:24,440
&quot;Awful to hear that a girl is interested in you.&quot;

28
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:30,000
(people in video laugh) (Felix laughs)

56
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:09,780
Careful what you wish for, *mmm*. This is a meme that is a lesson to learn for everyone.

57
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:22,430
You may think you wanna Capri-Sun, but do you really?

58
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:29,950
Goddamn. That was, that was hard. I'm not gonna lie, that was so freakin hard, but I pulled through and I made it.

59
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,460
Are you still in the game?

60
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:35,560
SKIPPER: Well boys, we did it. Racism is no more.

00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,800
OBAMA: Hello, Skipper.

62
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,940
SKIPPER: Mr. Obama, what are you doing here?

63
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:42,240
OBAMA: I came here to thank you for your great service to this country.

64
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,400
SKIPPER: No thanks necessary, Mr. Obama.

65
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,660
OBAMA: As a token of my gratitude. I'd like to give you the n-word pass.

66
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:53,900
SKIPPER: Mr. Obama, it is an honor to call you my...

FELIX: No, no, no, no.

68
00:03:56,510 --> 00:04:02,830
Moving on, everybody. This is going great. I'm still alive, still kicking it. It's incredible,

69
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:09,639

Okay, moving on!

72
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,500
BONGO CAT: We'll each need to take down about ten!

73
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,400
THANOS: Still your fear! It's now or never!

74
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,900
OBUNGA: We'll win this. I know we will!

75
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:29,220

Is anyone gonna make it? Come on, T-Series.

81
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:18,100
DAMN! Damn it! Damn it! How could I miss one?!

82
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,520
ddddttdt!! It doesn't work!

83
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,840
It's okay, it's okay. It's okay. All right.

84
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,560
Everyone's gonna die, it doesn't matter. T-Series will die too.

85
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:34,590
Oh no, T-Series isn't a physical being, it's a corporate entity that could technically live on forever. Oh, God.

86
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:35,940
Oh, God!

87
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:40,900
Damn it!

88
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:46,940

(unintelligible old man laughs and noises)

93
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:32,700
Come on.

94
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:37,400
He has such a beautiful laugh. There's no way you can't. Come on.

95
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:43,100

MAN: No! Please... no. No! Noo! Nooooo!

100
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:09,340
FELIX: Naw, that's what I'm saying, he dies anyway. It doesn't matter. Stop crying, it's okay, it's a video game. it's a video game!

101
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:14,400
God, ants aren't real! Jesus Christ...

102
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,800
MAN: Faster than a speeding bullet! More powerful than a locomotive!

103
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,459
...and it's strong enough to pick up pancake!

104
00:07:21,459 --> 00:07:26,050
FELIX: Oh my God. (laughs)

105
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,700

00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:30,200
What? My lettuce!

107
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,700

108
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,500
FELIX: Ice?!

109
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,500
MAN: It's so light, I can pick up a mess using my pinky!

110
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,020

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,000
FELIX: I'm freaking out over here!

121
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,400
MAN: ...your hands never touch the mess. And the Spin Broom has a mega-mouth, that's big enough...

122
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,300
FELIX: MEGA MOUTH!!

123
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,700
MAN: ...to pick up a ham sandwich! Look at that!

124
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,060

126
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:14,669

127
00:08:14,669 --> 00:08:15,940
FELIX: What about the pancakes?

128
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:16,800
MAN: ...lets you easily reach...

129
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,800
FELIX: What about the pancakes?!

130

MAN: 7 + 6 is 12, or 7 + 6 are 12?

137
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:57,310
7 + 6 is 12.

138
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:04,380
Well, it all depends on how you look at it, because from another perspective, it's 12, and from another perspective are 12.

139
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:11,230
Do you understand? It's like the criteria and the fundamentals you have as a person determine if it &quot;is&quot; or &quot;are&quot;.

140
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:18,300
FELIX: The criteria or the fundamentals as a person will affect the answer of this mathematical question.

141
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,300
Absolute mad lad.

142
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:26,800

FELIX: &quot;I am the shape of Dark Souls...2?&quot;

144
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,680
(starts off in Italian but then crazy yelling)

145
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,300
(chuckling and possible dying inside)

146
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:42,400
Who is this Italian animator that do... always do these amazing ones?

147
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,900
I want to know the source for this. Those are always great.

148
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,419
(crazy yelling)

149
00:09:47,419 --> 00:09:50,929
Okay, let's look at the result.

150
00:09:50,929 --> 00:09:54,459
Wow, it looks like I beat you again. How about that?

151
00:09:54,459 --> 00:09:58,839
