1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:07,120
 

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:15,840
Oh sweet! First edition Batman comic! You better not touch that or Sheldon will freak out. Oh, please. He'll never know. What are you doing?

3
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:31,020
Sheldon! Uh, nothing!

4
00:00:31,020 --> 00:01:15,600
Sheldon calculus joke

5
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:23,340
And now we'll add a happy little tree start with a little green

6
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,119
I am your senpai

7
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:44,300
Yeah, so yeah, hey guys, do you see the full moon outside full moon? Oh no, you won't need to get out of here I'm

8
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:58,070
Oh my gosh, he is so precious

9
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:03,020
It is time to begin my long day stapling paper

10
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:09,560
Someone encased my stapler in jello who could have done such a devious thing

11
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:15,780
It is amusing because Dwight is unaware that I am the one who did it

12
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:26,900
It's all slippery that is what she said

13
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:27,500
Mike

14
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,520
help me

15
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:38,340
too weak...

16
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:44,060
You've always had the power deep within you Lucas. Whoa, will you're okay? Yeah, where the hell are we?

17
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:50,550
Oh this is just a conveniently timed flashback of something that happened earlier in the season for some reason thinking about this

18
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:55,520
specific moment will provide you the courage and superhuman strength required to overcome your enemies also

19
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,760
Also we save a shit load of time and money by just reusing scenes we already shot

20
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,910
Oh, that makes sense, but is time frozen while this is happening or

21
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:05,821
am I too busy thinking of this when I should instead be thinking about fighting the monster.

22
00:03:05,821 --> 00:03:14,640
Oh, I can't freeze time. So yeah, you're probably getting eaten right now. So I guess I shouldn't have taken the time to question this flashback

23
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,540
Oh man!

24
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:56,600
Take one

25
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:07,280
We're charging it we're charging it get bigger get bigger bigger bigger bigger fire

26
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,049
Hey guys, thank you so much for watching this video. And yes, we know everything about anime

27
00:04:11,049 --> 00:04:15,820
So there's no reason to say that we don't understand anime in the comments because we've seen every single one

28
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:19,300
Definitely click the box on the left to find out what would happen if we put fairy tales in

29
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:28,000
2018 and click the box on the right to see if people acted like anime two
