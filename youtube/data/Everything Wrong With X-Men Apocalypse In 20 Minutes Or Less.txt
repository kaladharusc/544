[Music]

2
00:00:07,849 --> 00:00:10,410
is very to think filmmakers are

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:11,969
literally trying to put us with a length

4
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:13,440
of these logos at this point it's almost

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,570
as if wait was that noise born with

6
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,449
extraordinary abilities narration and

7
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:20,460
like most x-men movies this narration is

8
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,080
rehashed overly pompous poetic

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,880
meandering about genetic mutation give

10
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,699
someone wings and they may fly too close

11
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:28,500
to the Sun give a movie narration and

12
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,939
may prematurely expose it all over

13
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:31,859
itself also they twist cliche blue in

14
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:33,390
the x-men story while someone might get

15
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:34,800
wings they still have to obey the laws

16
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,360
of physics and are unable to fly too

17
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,710
close to the Sun like Icarus did

18
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,450
allegory be damned these mutants also

19
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:40,890
had the ability to rewrite history since

20
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:42,210
the Egyptian pyramids weren't even

21
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:43,469
started until a thousand years after

22
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:46,050
this hey even though this is a secret

23
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:47,070
ceremony and you don't need to

24
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,840
intimidate anyone be sure to snarl so we

25
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,219
can see how much of an evil bastard you

26
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:52,140
are don't worry it's a digital surgery

27
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,329
scar those heal up in 2.8 gigahertz Mali

28
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:55,800
watch the power of the Sun infused this

29
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,180
pyramid with solar power through

30
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,320
something that looks like an ancient

31
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,420
oversized microchip that melts gold and

32
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,070
races the platforms I realize it's

33
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,420
probably best that I not try and figure

34
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,339
out how this whole process is bull this

35
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:06,900
block takes out many other support beams

36
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,430
that are roughly the same size and not

37
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:09,900
only never slows down but actually

38
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:10,770
gained speed

39
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,510
oh hi Oscar Isaac guess this is the last

40
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:13,979
time we'll be seeing you at least your

41
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:15,990
real face and voice and non-verbally

42
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,640
Modi luckily for apocalypse and this

43
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,200
movie they dug the sub-basement of this

44
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,909
pyramid all the way to hell this icy

45
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:22,409
miss is so effective at blocking heavy

46
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:23,700
rocks it actually makes me wonder why

47
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,080
this wasn't done more often when they

48
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,430
were above ground getting hit by heavy

49
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,320
rocks here's the animated title sequence

50
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,540
and oh look Monalisa huh also we

51
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,650
interrupt this awkward segue from

52
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,509
ancient Egypt to the 1980s to show you a

53
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:34,829
sculpture of Jesus carrying a cross

54
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:36,720
through a tunnel by candlelight this is

55
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,250
just some place in Ohio no need for

56
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,750
specifics just no high ohing it up in

57
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,340
here are you kidding here this high

58
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,509
school kid is going through mutant

59
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:44,220
adolescents during a lecture on mutants

60
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,780
do I have that right you fuckin clowns

61
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,189
why don't you stop by the principal's

62
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:48,869
office and explain to him that you're

63
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:50,729
disrupting class again Jesus lady

64
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:51,899
he just politely asked to go to the

65
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:53,280
bathroom it's not like it was smoking

66
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,470
PCP during your bull mutant presentation

67
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,149
Scots powerful laser eyes are no match

68
00:01:57,149 --> 00:01:58,409
for the integrity of a bathroom stall

69
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:00,060
which protects the bully somehow but

70
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,409
destroy everything else so that Scott

71
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:03,149
can remain guiltless well at least they

72
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:04,350
aren't sexualizing mystique in this

73
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,360
movie also this is ten years later right

74
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,649
shouldn't she be close to turning into

75
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:09,060
Rebecca remain by now it is my belief

76
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,800
that roughly 45% of the Marvel Universe

77
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,569
have their origin stories rooted in

78
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:15,590
fighting people in cage match

79
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:17,970
and someone tell me how Nightcrawler a

80
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,760
got captured and be stayed captured also

81
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,470
wait you're matching it teleporter up

82
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,060
against a guy with wings I know this is

83
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,410
underground fighting and rules are not a

84
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:26,790
concern this fight is the very

85
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,470
definition of unfair and anyone who

86
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,000
blindly bet on angels should be storming

87
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,230
the betting windows after Nightcrawler

88
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:33,090
wins easily also I can see this as a

89
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:34,260
cage with electric current running

90
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,610
through it but how was net Karl are not

91
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,170
able to transport through it anyway he

92
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:38,580
can't just transport outside

93
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,290
hey I'm mystique can impersonate anyone

94
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:42,150
but she uses her power to change clothes

95
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:44,010
mid scene in case you confused it for

96
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:45,660
Bruce Kyle Kentucky there was no fucking

97
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,040
way Eric's been hiding out anywhere

98
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,690
after the attack on Washington that no

99
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,040
one can recognize him as Ludacris to

100
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,810
Superman Clark Kent levels I mean they

101
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,910
teach about him in Ohio schools no one

102
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,290
will be seated during the magneto has a

103
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:56,640
happy marriage and a child who has

104
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,990
befriended a fucking deer and they all

105
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,940
visit the well see where did you learn

106
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,070
that song papa I learned it from my

107
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:04,020
parents and they learned it from their

108
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:06,180
parents and then from there ladies and

109
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,270
gentlemen the x-men and one day you know

110
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:11,100
sang it 210

111
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,420
provided you don't get killed in a freak

112
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,540
arrow accident what's happened to them

113
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:17,010
Thanks oh they were horribly murdered in

114
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:18,210
a concentration camp while I was

115
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:19,740
tortured by Kevin Bacon but that's a

116
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,060
story for another night darling now get

117
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:21,570
some sleep

118
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:22,500
I've had just about enough of these

119
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,850
glamour shots of this sign thank you

120
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:25,770
very much that has now stop fresh

121
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:29,220
without remembrance ah th white yet

122
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,660
again Professor X is caught quoting

123
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,010
classic literature instead of teaching

124
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:33,240
these kids about how to fight evil

125
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:33,900
whatever

126
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,820
I guess poetry matters and somehow I

127
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,230
mean that is what the characters are

128
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:38,190
gonna think at the end of this movie

129
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,780
after a global war with apocalypse know

130
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,220
what good is a school for mutants that

131
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,840
just teaches the regular ap creative

132
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,820
writing really movie you list Ohio in

133
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,650
one location East Berlin in another but

134
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:48,030
now it's the full Cairo Egypt pick a

135
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:50,010
goddamn format already Jesus we first

136
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:51,780
saw Moya in x-men first class which was

137
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,120
set in 1962 she has no powers but in

138
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,770
1983 she still looks the same as she did

139
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,420
then even though this hole is partially

140
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,040
blocked by carpets and an unconscious

141
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,510
dude The Sun will still shine enough to

142
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:01,830
make this pyramid thing he do its thing

143
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,570
now conveniently coincidental that

144
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:05,040
you're here right now thousands of years

145
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,360
after this asshole was entombed

146
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,130
right as he's being resurrected and you

147
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:09,990
have x-men ties this is a whole bunch of

148
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,670
discount Inner Earth Tron graphics that

149
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:12,870
does not bring us any closer to

150
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,400
understanding the bull contraption and

151
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,230
just before this fucker awakens I'd like

152
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:17,489
to remind the viewing audience that the

153
00:04:17,489 --> 00:04:19,260
superhero movie is entirely predicated

154
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,790
on the idea of an ancient all-powerful

155
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,770
God going to sleep long ago and then

156
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,419
waking up just as the producers of Days

157
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:25,770
of Future past we're looking for sequel

158
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:26,790
ideas Rose Byrne

159
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:32,100
is laura croft ex person because someone

160
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,540
decided to wake up apocalypse right now

161
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,160
an earthquake in egypt was felt all the

162
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,720
way to Germany and causes Eric to use

163
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,400
his powers to save someone adding him as

164
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,930
a mutant okay if it was that damn

165
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:41,400
powerful Egypt should be in ruins

166
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,110
also I'm no seismologist but an

167
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,460
earthquake felt all over the world would

168
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,320
probably be kind of devastating to the

169
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,790
entire world right how does a quake in

170
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,140
Egypt register all over the world

171
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,490
without kind of fucking up the Earth's

172
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:51,960
tectonic makeup and I'm much more

173
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,010
permanent and we're all gonna die

174
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:54,780
fashion no you don't know what it's like

175
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,180
to be afraid to shut your eyes to be

176
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,220
trapped inside your own head gene says

177
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,750
this too literally the only person in

178
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,220
the world who does know exactly what

179
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:02,820
this is like

180
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,020
Charles locates his ex-girlfriend

181
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,460
halfway around the world but somehow

182
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,870
misses the most powerful mutant the

183
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,340
world has ever known that has literally

184
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,200
steps away from her she looks amazing

185
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,690
she's barely aged today I know right

186
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:14,220
that should raise some red flags of some

187
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,500
kind I told you who my boss the first

188
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,490
night I met you I trusted you then I

189
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:22,650
need you to trust me now Jesus Eric told

190
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:24,090
his girl he was one of the world's most

191
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,650
dangerous fugitives on the first date

192
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,180
and she stuck with him I guess the

193
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,440
future mrs. Lynde sure had already seen

194
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,870
shame haha we've somehow surreptitiously

195
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,160
kidnapped your daughter and took her to

196
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,540
this random place in the woods that we

197
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:36,030
knew you'd find eventually premature

198
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:37,740
relation also could this accidental

199
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:38,970
arrowing actually happen

200
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:40,710
possibly does it feel manufactured to

201
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,510
make Eric angry at humans again I think

202
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,130
that's the sin here also this arrow

203
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:45,810
Pierce is both Nina and Magda partly

204
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,340
because life hates Eric more than any

205
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,900
other person who ever lived but also

206
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,580
because either one of them continuing to

207
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,560
live in this world means no Magneto so

208
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,880
these deaths are for your entertainment

209
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,710
assholes recently awoke an all-powerful

210
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,600
God wastes his first few hours wandering

211
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,830
through an Egyptian farmers market

212
00:05:58,830 --> 00:05:59,970
because he's so shocked at the

213
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:01,230
advancement of society in his absence

214
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,000
he's unable to even remember this world

215
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,890
domination plan I guess luckily Yong

216
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:06,390
storm just happens to be here to get

217
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:08,190
caught shoplifting by apocalypse and she

218
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,480
just happens to know where to take him

219
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,190
when he saves her ass awesome trick

220
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:12,300
that's never used again in this movie

221
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,550
also the pod is this power I shall take

222
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:15,930
the sand from a stone pillar and cut

223
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:17,400
their necks with it I'm making it up as

224
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:17,850
I go along

225
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:20,280
death by masonry osmosis I want to the

226
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,460
minds of all memories of us Beach Cuba

227
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,370
well wind up did you do that I felt it

228
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:28,380
was the best thing for her

229
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,880
goddammit more movie idiots trying to

230
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,170
protect loved ones from emotional pain

231
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:34,140
by lying to them we were hoping that you

232
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,160
would tell us about what happened

233
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,810
yesterday in Egypt

234
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:38,400
wait that happened yesterday it was

235
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,840
daytime in Egypt and nighttime in New

236
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,750
York when Mora found

237
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,490
ruins and apocalypse will go in this

238
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:43,330
case she would have had to go

239
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:44,770
immediately from the marketplace to an

240
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:46,720
airport fly 15 hours back to Washington

241
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,010
and get to the office in time for

242
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:49,300
Charles's visit instead of the

243
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,410
screenwriters paying attention to the

244
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,000
reality of time zones ever since the

245
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,130
world found out about mutants in 73

246
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:56,470
there have been cults who see them as

247
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:58,660
some kind of second coming or sign of

248
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:01,090
God I was tracking one of them because

249
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:02,890
the CIA is most interested in using its

250
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,480
money and resources to track down colts

251
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,530
who think mutants are gods

252
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:06,940
luckily they sent me the person who

253
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,200
Charles fell in love with in first class

254
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,390
they think he lived all that time yes

255
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:12,370
and no they believed he had the ability

256
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:14,290
to transfer his consciousness from body

257
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:16,690
to body to use exposition like the Four

258
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:18,070
Horsemen of the Apocalypse

259
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:21,010
wha-wha also rule credits great fighter

260
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:23,830
she's my hero I want to be like her but

261
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:24,580
you can't

262
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,320
she has transforming powers you have the

263
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,730
ability to control the weather so you

264
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:31,380
aren't and never can be like her

265
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,360
learning from touching a TV in 1983 sure

266
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,830
you can learn everything you ever need

267
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,000
to know from that contraption

268
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,770
they're called learning electrons and

269
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:40,480
apocalypse binge watches the historical

270
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,919
documents of I Dream of Jeannie to learn

271
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,570
about modern culture we're sure to see

272
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:45,010
lots of stuff about war here because

273
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:46,450
every supernatural being who learns

274
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:47,800
about the world through speed reading or

275
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,570
Fifth Element or how Lucy did it in that

276
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:51,070
movie whose name I've forgotten runs

277
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,720
across copious amounts of war and almost

278
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,940
zero porn if I can't take over sue are

279
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,169
these assholes still walking away from

280
00:07:56,169 --> 00:07:58,330
the underground cage match please aren't

281
00:07:58,330 --> 00:07:59,860
they somewhere stories taking place yet

282
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:02,440
sign up gets a little jealous and that's

283
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,880
all you'll ever hear or know about this

284
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,380
character basically how far can you

285
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,990
cover as far as I can see or if I've

286
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:09,550
been there before but not if I'm in an

287
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,440
electric cage I cannot get past that

288
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,450
because of electricity sorry to break it

289
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:14,650
to you but you're not the biggest freak

290
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:17,680
in the school and love cut I thought I'd

291
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,930
see her again yeah me neither yeah it

292
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:21,220
took six million and the promise of

293
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,070
filming in Europe to convince me I was

294
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:25,660
afraid this is what Aaron Rodgers said

295
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,070
to get her to go out with him and his

296
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,450
coincidentally the same thing he tells

297
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:29,590
himself in the mirror before every

298
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:31,390
football game I know the kind of mutants

299
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:33,250
you're looking and I know where to find

300
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,770
me how does the god apocalypse need some

301
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:37,630
non God human mutants help in finding

302
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:39,310
the mutants he needs like he totally

303
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,020
doesn't right the only thing American

304
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,430
about this place is that it used to be

305
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:43,930
British when did Scott become this guy

306
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:45,520
he gets a pair of shades that protect

307
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,780
his eyes from blasting everything and

308
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:49,180
now he's an asshole

309
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,399
you think I'd knock off a sin for the

310
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:53,020
movie using a deep cut Metallica song

311
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,910
but when the song says on the nose as

312
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,740
the Four Horsemen it gets a sin with no

313
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,360
remorse this is the guy they took

314
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,830
apocalypse to even though they're very

315
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,450
aware of more powerful mutants like

316
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:03,250
mystique or Quicksilver Jean Grey or

317
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,649
really almost any other except for that

318
00:09:05,649 --> 00:09:06,910
little who can blink and change the

319
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:07,330
channel

320
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:09,040
he's got metal wings that throw knives I

321
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,570
guess his body constantly regenerates

322
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:12,339
the amount of metal he needs to fly and

323
00:09:12,339 --> 00:09:14,380
fight at the same time no it's cool damn

324
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:17,310
it it is cool right

325
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:19,899
you this movie gave Wolverines line to

326
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:21,550
magneto and this movie should be ashamed

327
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:22,899
this guy just litters body parts

328
00:09:22,899 --> 00:09:24,399
wherever he goes I'd like to know why

329
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:25,779
his power leaves certain things intact

330
00:09:25,779 --> 00:09:27,010
is it because it looks awesome in a

331
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:29,860
movie let's see and that is all it takes

332
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,480
for super independent air to just go

333
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,700
along come and see Jesus if only Charles

334
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,380
had known all these years that this was

335
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,880
the magic phrase to get Erik to listen

336
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,589
to your argument this is where your

337
00:09:38,589 --> 00:09:41,470
power was born um his power was born

338
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:43,360
when he was because its genetic you mean

339
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,740
to say this is where your power was a

340
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,420
weakened by Kevin Bacon I think did we

341
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,740
really need to go back to Auschwitz to

342
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,300
turn Erik to the dark side didn't the

343
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,890
loss of his new family already do that I

344
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:51,850
feel like this is already embedded

345
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:53,350
motivation in the first place we know

346
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,850
this story already we've got to spend

347
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:55,900
time and a two-and-a-half-hour movie

348
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,000
rehashing it I know heavy flying rocks

349
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,589
and debris expert but this appears to be

350
00:09:59,589 --> 00:10:01,240
a dangerous place to be for anyone who

351
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:06,339
was in a mortal right now you are

352
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:08,290
clearly playing miss pac-man not the

353
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:10,300
same at all it's so much about this

354
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,070
place Moira is working on one of the

355
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,510
most important mutant stories in history

356
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,130
but hasn't thought to contact the school

357
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:17,230
for mutants for their input I'm just

358
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:19,390
saying Empire is still the best it's the

359
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:21,190
most complex that our most sophisticated

360
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:23,230
here's a popular Star Wars opinion being

361
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:24,610
presented to something fans were saying

362
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:26,470
on their way out of having seen Return

363
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:27,730
of the Jedi which is simply not the case

364
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:29,830
Empire rose to prominence years after

365
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,660
the original trilogy completed and this

366
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,610
already trihard movie is now overdosing

367
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:38,020
on try harm you'll be going for humor

368
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,640
ends up with a morbid prediction also

369
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,950
this is 1983 or very few franchises

370
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,690
actually had a planned continuous story

371
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:45,399
overall trilogy you can't make a

372
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:46,930
definitive statement like this as if it

373
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:48,910
were common in 1983 to have trilogies

374
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:51,100
like this so up the Academy was released

375
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,779
in 1980 so if this theater is still

376
00:10:52,779 --> 00:10:54,579
showing it in 1983 along with Return of

377
00:10:54,579 --> 00:10:55,029
the Jedi

378
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,890
it's in rough financial shape I mean to

379
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:59,260
turn it into a real campus University

380
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,870
not just for mutants either

381
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,810
for humans - about humans yep Charles

382
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:06,370
has somehow been too afraid or too lazy

383
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:08,140
to use cerebro to look for his lost

384
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,760
friend Erik all these years and stays a

385
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,440
future past that's actually supposed to

386
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,910
be believable but one visit from

387
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,650
mystique and his gripping look for Erik

388
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:16,300
using cerebro fear is released I'm

389
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,990
connected to all of their minds oh you

390
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:21,400
are you connected to all mutant minds or

391
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,990
not these two statements uttered within

392
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,400
ten seconds of each other mind you are

393
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,339
entirely in Congress these are all the

394
00:11:27,339 --> 00:11:29,589
mutants I'm connected to all of their

395
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:31,150
minds and I will explain this process

396
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,830
again in this movie because we're trying

397
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,000
to match the number of times Bruce

398
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,350
Wayne's parents were killed in movies

399
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:37,510
you think because you can see into my

400
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:40,360
head you know how it feels actually I

401
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,589
thought his power gave him more than

402
00:11:41,589 --> 00:11:42,940
just access to your brain but also

403
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,770
emotions but I'm the least concerned

404
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:45,970
about this person on the entire planet

405
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:47,950
so I'll just sin and move on so I can

406
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:51,370
help you oh yes this movie gave Erik a

407
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:53,200
new tragedy in the loss of his wife and

408
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,970
child but still this is the exact same

409
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:56,170
argument these two have been having for

410
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:59,050
all the x-men movies how did you not

411
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:00,940
already know that either cerebro totally

412
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,260
missed the mutant standing close to Erik

413
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,670
or Erik somehow block them from his mind

414
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,920
someone's taking over cerebro at this

415
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,120
point you're basically dealing with God

416
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,589
the very idea that this guy could be

417
00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:17,050
defeated as a fantasy dialog is starting

418
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:18,220
to sound more and more like Radiohead

419
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,140
lyrics as the movie goes along yes in

420
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,000
the event of nuclear holocaust Stan Lee

421
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,820
will die just like you and me making

422
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,170
cerebral work as hard as hell in these

423
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:27,790
movies but breaking that damn near

424
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:31,779
impossible for some reason even though

425
00:12:31,779 --> 00:12:33,580
control over anything my brain does

426
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,830
anymore I do have enough backup good guy

427
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:37,270
power to tell you what needs to be done

428
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,650
to save humanity I feel like this could

429
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:40,150
have been done way earlier but you know

430
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:41,860
plot sequencing I'm glad he's here

431
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,240
because Quicksilver is the best thing

432
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,800
about the last couple of movies but damn

433
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,510
this is amazing timing first off let me

434
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:48,130
remove the reasons before I start being

435
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:49,810
an asshole about this scene the problem

436
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,610
for me is I know Quicksilver is like

437
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:53,440
super fast like our minds can't even

438
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,480
comprehend how fast he is but even if

439
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,589
he's faster than the speed of light

440
00:12:56,589 --> 00:12:58,480
which he's not he's somehow able to save

441
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,010
everybody in the mansion going inside

442
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:01,930
then outside inside then outside an

443
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:03,070
explosion like this wouldn't take

444
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:04,300
terribly long to blow the whole mansion

445
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,380
but we're supposed to believe he's

446
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,520
quicker than this some of them and I

447
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,050
ain't buying it I love it but I ain't

448
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:09,640
buying it also you know it'd be great

449
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,959
after seeing something like this the

450
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:12,490
normal speed version on videotape or

451
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:13,839
something did Quicksilver just kill

452
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,130
these two kids who

453
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:16,780
blows up the x-men mansion like it's the

454
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,550
Starship Enterprise or something the cop

455
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:20,530
team why because in the last movie she

456
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:22,330
was an evil attempted assassin pretty

457
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:23,380
sure I got everybody

458
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,720
Alex was closest to the blast which I

459
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,700
guess means he's dead then Quicksilver

460
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,470
cup that badly was it because he spent

461
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:30,790
so much time slow mowing around with

462
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:33,220
dogs and pizza cuz I bet it was anti

463
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,810
mutant power gun seems like an awesome

464
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:36,280
weapon against mutants so of course it's

465
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,210
never used again in this movie

466
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:38,830
thankfully Stryker is disabled all

467
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:40,570
mutants weapon which is some bull by the

468
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,100
way didn't reach far enough to affect

469
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,630
these teenage mall visiting slackers

470
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:44,290
phew

471
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,580
I know gene doesn't have much control

472
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,470
over her powers but maybe she might try

473
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,610
to infect the minds of all these

474
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:49,870
soldiers and make them just go away

475
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,280
especially after this dude doesn't see

476
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,870
them and gives the all-clear seems like

477
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,370
she could do something to stop this

478
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:55,630
other than the plan that she comes up

479
00:13:55,630 --> 00:14:01,060
with later I can't some kind of

480
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,500
electrical field prevents genetic

481
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,060
mutants from using their powers because

482
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,290
electricity and genetics are so

483
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:06,940
inextricably linked and such these

484
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,530
characters are all sad about havoc dying

485
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:10,090
and I don't blame them it's just that

486
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:11,290
have we really ever gotten to know that

487
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:12,610
dude over three movies he's basically

488
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:14,170
done nothing right I had to look up this

489
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:15,760
guy's name like ten times during this

490
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,350
one movie alone character and actor

491
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:19,150
because these x-men movies can't seem to

492
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,410
escape previous plot points and

493
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:22,090
emotional motivations we now return to

494
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:24,610
alkaline lake o Jawa Olivia Munn poses

495
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:26,230
for her action figure here because she's

496
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:28,450
given nothing else to do whatever it is

497
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:31,510
you think you saw in me Charles I buried

498
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:33,730
it with my family

499
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:36,700
families Erik families that event

500
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,830
emanated from exactly where we found you

501
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:41,230
at the home of the world's most powerful

502
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:44,620
psychic so you're going to tell me where

503
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:47,260
is Charles Xavier if the whole point was

504
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,760
to find Charles why did they leave all

505
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,440
the other possible witnesses lying on

506
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,090
the lawn outside and why didn't they

507
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:53,980
check the mansion they just flew in shot

508
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,540
some sort of unconscious cannon rounded

509
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,650
up the few main characters and then

510
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:58,780
bounced what did you mean when you said

511
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,640
someone more powerful than Charles

512
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,410
what's Hank not there during the whole

513
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:03,620
cerebro event

514
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:07,690
[Music]

515
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:10,130
wait a fuckin second the last time we

516
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:11,720
saw Jean Scott and Nightcrawler they

517
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,130
were in the back of the helicopter you

518
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:14,270
know the one where they have the special

519
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:15,590
force field that keeps them from using

520
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:17,660
their powers so how in the did they get

521
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,310
out of that helicopter did Stryker turn

522
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:20,600
the force field off when they landed and

523
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,830
why would he do such a stupid thing like

524
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,450
that during this massive worldwide

525
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:25,460
telepathic message a lot of this traffic

526
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,260
continues to move normally in New York

527
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,180
man they don't get distracted by I guess

528
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,950
no reason for a magic mutant force field

529
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:32,750
in this area what could go wrong also

530
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:33,920
they sure found a way to shoehorn

531
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,510
Wolverine Weapon X into this movie

532
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:37,040
didn't they yes nothing to do with this

533
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,170
fucking movie but here he is and is this

534
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:40,760
even a teaser for a later movie and the

535
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,560
next movie is old so I guess they're

536
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,850
gonna skip this part of the Wolverine

537
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:45,530
evolution and this was just a big excuse

538
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:46,700
to get some Wolverine action into the

539
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,380
movie this would be badass Wolverine

540
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,760
fight scene is rendered moot by this

541
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,860
movie's pussyfooting pg-13 rating thank

542
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:52,700
you pussy footage

543
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,530
this goes on for some time an hour and

544
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:56,120
38 minutes into the movie and I'm still

545
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,560
wondering why the hell apocalypse needs

546
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,970
any of these assholes to complete his

547
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:00,320
plant he looks like he's doing just fine

548
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,030
on his own destruction on a scale so

549
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:03,710
large it will take seven whole days for

550
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:05,840
Lex Corp to fix it hey guys flight suits

551
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,820
which we'll all surely for this wipe

552
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:10,580
clean this one was there even any need

553
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,960
for apocalypse to tell the world he was

554
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,520
gonna everyone fit up and start his

555
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,720
godlike rule if he was just gonna

556
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,310
destroy the fuck out of cities like this

557
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:18,140
really the only reason why someone this

558
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,490
powerful needed to send a message in a

559
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:20,720
movie like this was to give Charles an

560
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,280
excuse to send a secret message to Jean

561
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,200
once again the bad guys main weakness is

562
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,630
boasting we called ourselves the x-men

563
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:28,580
reminiscing well it kind of looks cool I

564
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,500
can think of no reason all-powerful god

565
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,240
apocalypse would need his underling

566
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,100
magneto to pull a centuries-old ship out

567
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,600
of the ocean whatever weapon he intends

568
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,040
to make out of this ancient metal surely

569
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,300
there are easier ways for him to do it

570
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,310
considering he's a all-powerful God and

571
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:42,440
holy Sh apocalypse had time to make

572
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,240
statues of the horsemen I mean I thought

573
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,800
this was just a starter temple but he's

574
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,180
already decorating he's dying to

575
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:49,220
transfer his consciousness into the

576
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,470
professor if he does that he'll have the

577
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:53,420
power to control every mind in the world

578
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,860
pretty much confirms that apocalypse

579
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,120
could have done this first before making

580
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,920
Charles do it which led to him sneaking

581
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,510
a message to Jean but that's an

582
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,740
inconvenient detail these filmmakers

583
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,270
hope you don't notice this girl is

584
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:03,950
playing young storm and I mostly feel

585
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:05,300
sorry for her since I don't think she's

586
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,410
spoken more than one or two lines of

587
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:08,300
dialogue this entire movie good news she

588
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,680
got the role of storm the new x-men

589
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,450
movie bad news you have practically no

590
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:16,180
lines

591
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:18,740
yeah it's what's her name again

592
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,480
and then the job that really what's her

593
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,040
name anyway

594
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,540
Aaron Rodgers girlfriend cut the car in

595
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,100
half but the piece is still nearly

596
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,870
killed storm so I'm guessing if you ran

597
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:28,610
a simulator 20,000 times storm will be

598
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:31,970
dead in 90% of the scenarios Olivia Munn

599
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:33,530
gets the Ray Park one-line treatment

600
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:34,910
proving Bryan Singer's at least not

601
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:36,860
sexist I know you think you've lost

602
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:39,530
everything but you haven't this

603
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:41,870
eventually works you have more family

604
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:43,580
than you know well that's the end of

605
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,900
Quicksilver because everyone who gets

606
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:45,980
close to Erick dies

607
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,330
sorry kid if I could tell you to avoid

608
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:48,800
Ultron I would let's talk about

609
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,510
apocalypses plan which was to wait

610
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:51,890
thousands of years to be resurrected

611
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:53,600
then recruit a team of four horsemen

612
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,310
helpers that each still have issues then

613
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,930
attack the entire world so that the

614
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:58,730
x-men will respond then kidnap Charles

615
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:00,410
and hook him up to this convenient duel

616
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:02,240
slab Egyptian ceremony thing and you

617
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,400
know what I'm done right here this out

618
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,930
of control in the name of a few pre

619
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:07,370
planned effect shots you assholes have

620
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:08,720
allowed this film's plot to veer into

621
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,610
the territory of the insane should we or

622
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:12,050
should we not follow the advice of the

623
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:14,180
galactically stupid this procedure that

624
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,680
formerly required a parade and

625
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,420
incantation several onlookers and the

626
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,310
son to be just right in the sky now can

627
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,870
be done in two minutes flat and positive

628
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:23,030
seems a inch bigger than yourself movie

629
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:24,920
pads it's already ridiculous run time by

630
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,420
showing flashbacks to previous movies

631
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:29,810
Jesus movie and and oh I like that cute

632
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:31,250
she thought the guy who was buried under

633
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,720
a rock for several millennia and has the

634
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,620
power of God was gonna die from this hey

635
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:38,390
remember when apocalypse use sand to cut

636
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:39,860
off those guys heads but never used it

637
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,360
again in super obvious situations like

638
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,620
this one she's not the real

639
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:43,910
what's-her-name then what the fuck is

640
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:44,870
the real what's-her-name doing

641
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,400
I guess she's somewhere jerking off this

642
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,170
movie is super not fun this is Charles

643
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:49,820
physically beating a man in some sort of

644
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,140
dream state I don't know what the

645
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,700
punches really represent but I guess

646
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,110
this is causing some sort of pain I

647
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:55,640
don't know a fight between mutants with

648
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,290
extraordinary powers devolves into a

649
00:18:57,290 --> 00:19:01,850
punching match basically yep Charles

650
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,410
pretty much kept the rules of Inception

651
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:04,940
there Apocalypse knew he was in a dream

652
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,320
and the projections took over

653
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,150
rookie mistake Magneto's definitely the

654
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:09,530
type of guy who enjoys dramatic

655
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:11,150
entrances and taking all the surprise

656
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,770
out of an attack he could've blindsided

657
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:14,360
apocalypse wit this seems kind of early

658
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,710
for Jean Grey does suddenly burst into

659
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:16,430
