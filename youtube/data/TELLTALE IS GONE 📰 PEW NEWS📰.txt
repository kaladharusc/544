Man: &quot;THIS IS CNN BREAKING NEWS&quot;

3
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:07,100
SPECIAL NEWS REPORTING! This has just come in.

4
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:14,000
The Walking Dead developer, Telltale, hit with devastating layoffs as part of a 'majority studio closure.'

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,540
Telltale games is SHUTTING DOWN!

6
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:24,020
I'm Poppy Harlow, and you're watching the special news reported [report] of Pew News. The most trusted news source of all...ᵘⁿᶦᵛᵉʳˢᵉ

[Pew News intro music]

8
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,480
Thank you for tuning in live on this special news report.

9
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,520
Telltale Games is ShUtTiN dOWN

10
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,020
They made a statement saying;

11
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:49,060
&quot;A small group of 25 employees staying on to fulfill the company's obligations to its board and partners&quot;

12
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:54,200
Telltale Games which, of course, has made such popular games, like, 'The Walking Dead' and 'The Wolf Among Us'

13
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:59,060
and this means a layoff of 225 people

14
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,520
That's a lotta people.

15
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,920
But they &quot;Will fulfill the obligations to its board and partners.&quot;

16
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,400
They JUST released 'Walking Dead: The Final Season',

17
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,880
Episode 2 is supposed to come out next week!

18
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,280
But apparently, they're not gonna finish it.

19
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,980
We're not gonna get the end of Clementine; the final story.

20
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:19,200
Most likely they're not gonna release Episode 3 and 4.

21
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,860
Uh- what will they release, however, to appease their board and partners?

22
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:25,220
MiNeCrEfT

23
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:28,520
Yea, that's right, Netflix &quot;Minecraft: The Story&quot;

24
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,300
At least  we will have that. Thank you, Telltale.

25
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:36,300
So what happens to everyone that bought The Walking Dead Final Season?

26
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,380
AEHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH no

27
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:41,020
A lot of people were very sad and upset about this.

28
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:46,820
Obviously, it's a big problem. A lot of people lost their job; that's never something to be celebrated.

29
00:01:46,820 --> 00:02:01,900
Brandon, who is one of the developers on Telltale said *reads tweet*

30
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,540
He's not getting even a severage(severance?) package

31
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:07,700
people are just let go uh- out of nowhere

32
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:16,140
Apparently, people even- uh -relocated cross-country and they were hiring people 2 weeks before this announcement.

33
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,480
ʰᵒʷ ᶜʳᵃᶻʸ ᶦˢ ᵗʰᵃᵗˀ

34
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,480
Way to keep people in the dark.

35
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:25,820
The good news out of all of this is that a lot of big companies have reached out and said, &quot;Hey, don't worry, we got you.&quot;

36
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,860
Blizzard reached out, &quot;Anyone that is looking for a new job.&quot;

37
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,580
Twitch reached out, same sentiment.

38
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:35,580
DICE reached out , Paradox reached out, Epic Games reached out, Naughty Dog made a statement,

39
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,620
HALO, Ubisoft, PLAYER UNKNOWN

40
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:45,140
All these, big, big developing companies are opening their doors and uh- that's great.

41
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:49,280
I think- Yes, it sucks that a lot of people got- lost their job,

42
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:55,080
but if this is how they treat their employees anyway, then I'm sure they'll be better off

43
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,080
I know it sucks now but-

44
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,840
Telltale's Walking Dead: Season One was HUGE for my channel,

45
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,420
a big chapter for my career, even.

46
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:10,320
When we played it, it was one of the most fun things I've ever done because we got to share this amazing experience-

47
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:14,620
with a huge pack of people that enjoyed it an equal amount.

48
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,940
And just sharing that as a group was incredible...

49
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:21,080
and being so invested in the characters that in the end you were even crying (oh we were the ones crying, Felix?)

50
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,960
And i think a lot of people were so emotionally invested as well that they did the same thing.

51
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,960
I'm super thankful for that, and i will never forget that.

52
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,700
*stutters*

53
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,700
I'm so glad I had that experience

54
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,740
And even Season Two, I thought, was great; I loved it as well.

55
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:43,380
as a fan of the- uhh- the series- to see it go down like this doesn't make me sad, it makes me really, really disappointed

56
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:49,700
Coz I'm mostly critical of things , not bec- out of nowhere, but because i know they can do better.

57
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,720
I knew they can do better than this.

58
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,840
That's why I'm so... I'm upset. I'm pissed off.

59
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,380
Even 2 years ago, when i played The Walking Dead: Michonne, this was my reaction.

60
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,380
*sigh*

61
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:03,060
*music*

62
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:09,400
I'm really disappointed; I think you could tell already; very very very very disappointed.

63
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,940
Why was I so disappointed?

64
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:16,480
Well because the whole experience was completely lackluster- in -compared with what they did in Season One.

65
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:20,380
Do I expect them to top what they did originally every single time?

66
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,540
Absolutely not.

67
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:27,060
But to constantly introduce new characters over and over and over,

68
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:31,860
to then just be met with an ending that felt like- it -nothing really mattered.

69
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,700
I- it's upsetting.

70
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,580
Game of Thrones- I didn't even bother finishing.

71
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:41,320
Batman- I didn't even continue playing because I wasn't invested enough.

72
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:50,300
They released so many games; two seasons of Minecraft, Walking dead Michonne, Walking dead-all the DLCs, Guardians of the Galaxy

73
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,540
it ruined your eagerness to play more,

74
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,460
which is such a shame because they did do really good games.

75
00:04:55,460 --> 00:05:00,000
And I know it sounds a bit- uhhh -childish to have that sentiment,

76
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
but I think a lot of people agree with it.

77
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,940
They've just made too many games instead of focusing on the really good ones.

78
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:09,060
[The] Wolf Among Us was a series a lot of people were excited about;

79
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,800
that was *five* years ago,

80
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,620
and now we will *never* see it because of all these bad decisions.

81
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,200
They kept adding new characters to everything.

82
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:21,920
How- how many characters from the original season of the walking dead-

83
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,880
which everyone played; so many people played.

84
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,000
How many are left in the last season, just Season Three.

85
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,920
ONE. It's Clementine.

86
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,920
Everyone else is gone.

87
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,220
How many people lasted from The Walking Dead DLCs

88
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,040
ZERO.

89
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,520
How many people from Walking Dead: Michonne-

90
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:43,380
all those characters that spent so many times trying to pick the right choices for-

91
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:46,240
How many of those characters are in Season Three?

92
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,080
NONE

93
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:51,380
They just keep giving you more and more characters and after a while, you just don't care.

94
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,240
Combine that with way too many games,

95
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,980
You-you're just not invested anymore.

96
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,440
Their engine has not been improved on until now.

97
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,780
It's such a shame as well because it seems like they're finally picking up their mistakes now,

98
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,540
when it's clearly too late.

99
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,540
Their engine is incredibly buggy

100
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:11,780
The lip-syncing is terrible, which takes you out of the immersion.

101
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:15,120
The graphic will just drop out of nowhere.

102
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,380
You'll see characters appearing in the background an disappearing

103
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:21,420
And just- uhh - just awkward movements in general.

104
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,500
It's just bad.

105
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,600
And then finally, the illusions of a choice

106
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:35,420
When you play TWD the first text that appears is, *reads what's on screen*

107
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,500
This is... not true.

108
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,680
It's simply not true.

109
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:48,880
I think most people know by now that when you play through a Telltale game, the ending will be exactly the same, no matter what choices you make.

110
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,780
But- people didn't know this when they played Season One.

111
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,160
You had that illusion of that you had a choice.

112
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:59,260
When it said that, &quot;Clementine feels hurt,&quot; and people said &quot;Restart the entire game.&quot;

113
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,000
I think people share that sentiment.

114
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,500
They were like, &quot;I really want to get the best outcome. I really care about these characters, so I'm going to try my best to really pick the best outcome

115
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:12,720
But the more games they pump out, the more you realize it's just the same ending no matter what.

116
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:20,480
And sometimes it was so transparent that you didn't even have to keep playing for more than a second to realize that your choice didn't even matter.

117
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:25,040
In game: &quot;Do something!&quot;

118
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,040
&quot;Stop!&quot;

119
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,820
&quot;Dammit Zachary, Now who is taking things too far!&quot;

120
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:34,400
&quot;What, I didn't- I- I-&quot;
&quot;Outside, now&quot;

121
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,600
Pewds: Well, that was completely pointless.

122
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,960
It made no difference anyway.

123
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:43,640
This is a reoccurring theme through Telltale games, and the more you notice it, the more it's impossible to miss.

124
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:49,060
Now, Telltale has dealt with this criticism for a long time and a lot of people have different opinions about it.

125
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:55,780
Some- from PC Gamer, for example, saying *reads on screen*

126
00:07:55,780 --> 00:08:02,640
While I saw other articles, previously criticizing telltale, saying that, &quot;Telltale needs to add consequence to out actions,

127
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:07,580
so I can sit on the edge of my seat again, and make heart-wrenching decisions that matter.

128
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:15,140
We know what actually the majority thinks because now they're shutting down coz not enough people want to buy their games anymore.

129
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:18,620
Because people don't feel that same way and engagement with them.

130
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:24,720
And we know it's not impossible to execute these interactive choices of [in] games.

131
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,240
We've seen it now in Detroit: Become Human, where how many different outcomes- you get to see all of them.

132
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,480
You understand that you can play the game very differently

133
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:39,920
If a character doesn't actually like you- if Hank will remember that- he will actually remember that,

134
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:44,000
and it will change the story of the game and the outcome of the ending that you get.

135
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,780
So a lot of people had been saying on twitter- blaming let's players for the fact that the company is shutting down,

136
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:57,960
which is not true. You have a lot of story games- uhh, being more popular than ever.

137
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:06,580
You have &quot;Stranger Things,&quot; (lmao) for example, which literally saved the company by releasing a game in a very much same style as TWD.

138
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:10,140
You have Quantic Dream doing a purely story based game, doing great.

139
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:15,800
And even if a game is a story with no interaction whatsoever, like visual novels,

140
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:21,640
it will still drive attention to the game and people will still want to experience it purely by themselves.

141
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:26,900
I think the people that just decide to watch it aren't gonna buy the game, regardless

142
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:31,380
So it doesn't really matter, you're not adding a sale to these people, but you're not taking one away anyway.

143
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:34,380
I found TWD through other let's players,

144
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:39,140
and I think they know that it was big for their game- that people played it online.

145
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:43,060
Some other games apparently were really good, like Batman and Borderlands.

146
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,840
People said that those were incredible.

147
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:48,940
But all these bad games like Walking Dead: Michonne just ruins it for everyone.

148
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:53,060
And the thing is, they made games before Walking Dead.

149
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,240
It was just that Walking Dead was their big hit.

150
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:59,860
That's what really made them take off, but it was also technically their downfall.

151
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:03,080
I'm so confident things could've been differently [different].

152
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,660
And that's why I'm not sad. I'm just disappointed.

153
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:11,360
I don't know who makes the decisions in the studio, but it seems like they have all kinds of strange internal conflict.

154
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,480
The former CEO apparently sued Telltale Games or tried to.

155
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:20,460
The developers saying that they knew about all the issues and all the criticisms that I probably already brought up.

156
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:28,260
They tried to do the best, but most likely it's not the developer's fault, it's the people making the decisions of the company, the company itself.

157
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:32,040
So I hope all of the developers can find new homes; I'm sure they will.

158
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,960
It seems like a lot of people reached out, which I'm very happy about.

159
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:39,360
I'm sad; I'm let down that we won't see the end of Clementine.

160
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,660
I think that's such a... such a shame.

161
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,040
What a waste.

162
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:48,860
I am incredibly thankful for what Walking dead did for my channel- that Telltale Games.

163
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:53,080
And it was such a great experience that I'm very very thankful for.

164
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:58,480
And to everyone that watched me playing those games- Thank you for sharing those memories with me.

165
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,440
I think it was incredible.

166
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,500
And the ones that experienced it, probably felt the same way.

167
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,960
And I think that's why I'm so emotionally invested into this.

168
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,020
That's why I'm so upset even though for most people, they don't even care.

169
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:12,620
I don't know. What do you guys think about this? What's your take on it?

170
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:17,580
I wanted to summarize everything as good as I can because- uh- that's what I like to do.

171
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:20,580
Hope it was enjoyable. I'll see you guys tomorrow. Bye~

172
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:25,000
