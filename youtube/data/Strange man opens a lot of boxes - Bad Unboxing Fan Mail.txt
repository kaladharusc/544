00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:00,600
shot of the new season it's been a while

24
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,600
since I've done this money shot

25
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:08,880
money shot part dukes coyote urine it's

26
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,900

give you a kiss yes I do happen to be

30
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,140
too pussy to drink a shot of coyote

31
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,270
urine maybe if I knew where the coyote

32
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:26,820
came from maybe then I'd be confident in

33
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,890
drinking the coyotes urine but this

34
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,290
could be as a coyote urine of a crack

35
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:33,750
dealer maybe Trump has a business where

36
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,030
he milks the urine out of coyotes that

37
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,579
is a strong odor but you know what's

38
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:40,170
funny is it's not as strong as the

39
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:43,439
calming coyote urine it's a very

40
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:49,680
dehydrated coyote yeah that oh oh fuck

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,799
that is not healthy coyote oh oh fuck

42
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:57,600

166
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,760
point I just hope that isn't out look I

167
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,420
hope you're not you accusing me I hope

168
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,940
you're not accusing me because if you

169
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,830
are accusing me I'm going to chop your

170
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:17,110
head off and put it in a dish I'm going

171
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:19,200
to put it in a dish and serve it to my

172
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,540
pinatas to my little piggy nose little

173
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,730
me home and a buncha Milky Way and a

174
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:27,580
couple of Pixy Stix EES to put in your

175
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,890
Dixie's your urethra but a pixie stick

176
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:32,020
down your urethra see what happens

177
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:35,680
I dare you do I put this on my rims

178
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,110
I don't really know God you sent me 20

179
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:38,910
of these

180
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:44,310
a ragged 20 I don't I'm sick like 20 is

181
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,270
necessary

182
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:49,550
it's a look guys is a barrel of monkeys

183
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:53,070
look I got two monkeys there that's two

184
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,770
unki three no long queue for you it's

185
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:57,390
kind of like a Miranda sings horror

186
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,050
flick

187
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:00,240
looks like someone's trying to render

188
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,180
act out Regan in to rush you know it's

189
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,440
pretty nicely you gave me this but I

190
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,440
need I remind you guys I have a full

191
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,510
head of hair we got two more packages

192
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:09,960
left

193
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:15,360
oh holy heck that's a lot of potpourri

194
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,550
we have a thing called clone of Willy

195
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:20,130
it's kind of next-level it says make a

196
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:23,670
vibrating silicone replica of any penis

197
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,770
I would do it all in this episode but it

198
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:27,840
looks like it might take more more time

199
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,570
than that this is maybe a couple day

200
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:32,039
long project so I'm gonna set this

201
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:38,490
inside very good gift very good accusing

202
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,530
me I must say I feel like the Rob locks

203
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:42,479
gentleman was the star of this episode

204
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,860
so this is to you you guys managed to

205
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:51,180
follow my instructions pretty well the

206
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:54,900
smell of potpourri it overpowers the

207
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,650
disgusting scent of the coyote urine

208
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:13,580
