00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,260
six miles at a seven forty two pace

6
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:54,840
that's a pretty serious run last week I

7
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,840
ran 70 miles seventy miles in seven days

8
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,489
that's one hundred and twelve kilometers

9
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:01,949
it's a big week for me kind of makes me

10
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:03,600
think that I should have run the

11
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,519
marathon this year this is the first

12
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,840
here in like five years where I'm not

13
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,650
running the marathon

14
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,770
you know I've run like 22 or 23

15
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,720
marathons if there's one thing I know is

16
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,880
that if you're hurt you're not feeling

17
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,670
it you don't do it but I know I'm

18
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,619
marathon day I'm just gonna like be the

19
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:20,880
most jealous guy and all in New York

20

21
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,000
okay there are like that many things did

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,950
I get super excited about that's not

23
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:32,170
true I get excited about everything but

24
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:36,149
I'm particularly excited about this okay

25
00:01:36,149 --> 00:01:41,170
so every day I mean every every day on

26
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:44,460
my way into work I get my juices

27
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,390
literally every

28
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:48,040
it's because if I don't have these

29
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,840
things I'll just see garbage all day

30
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,370
these don't last long if they're not

31
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:55,360
refrigerated so I keep this down here

32
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,790
but this I have feel like I smoked it I

33
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:59,560
got a refrigerator

34
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,810
not just any refrigerator though this is

35
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:04,090
a refrigerator that's used so mothers

36
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:06,280
that are nursing their babies can keep

37
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,410
their breast milk cold without having to

38
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:09,850
like keep it in the main room

39
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,170
I'm not kidding that's how I found it on

40
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:19,690

41

before I get into today's episode into

46
00:02:54,689 --> 00:02:56,790
today's episode I just want to address

47
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:59,609
the noise situation I mean do you hear

48
00:02:59,609 --> 00:03:03,090
it how do you not hear that this is uh

49
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:04,950
this is what goes on outside my office

50
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:19,000
all day every day for the last 16 years

51
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,049
somebody was in here somebody's smart

52
00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:22,189
and they're like I don't even notice the

53
00:03:22,189 --> 00:03:25,549
background noise I do it does bother me

54
00:03:25,549 --> 00:03:27,500
because I tried to provide you with

55
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,930
content that is considered and this is

56
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:31,040
so inconsiderate

57
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,739
I did mention last week how I aspire to

58
00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:35,659
be a technology reviewer and I'm not

59
00:03:35,659 --> 00:03:36,859
very good at it I don't really know what

60
00:03:36,859 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm doing okay

61
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,950
this is gonna continue in that thread a

62
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:42,170
while ago I got this package that said

63
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:44,810
do not open before October 18th today is

64
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:48,409
I know what this is to drone as always

65
00:03:48,409 --> 00:03:50,930
this is not a paid endorsement and if

66
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,459
this is a terrible product I'll let you

67
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:54,709
know okay so what this thing is is this

68
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:56,000
is supposed to be like an indoor

69
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,150
handheld foldable drone that you just

70
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,500
like throw up in the air and it takes a

71
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,030
picture and it sits in your pocket like

72
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,799
I don't know they like emailed me a

73
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:05,359
hundred times about it but you know I

74
00:04:05,359 --> 00:04:07,669
totally understand why companies send me

75
00:04:07,669 --> 00:04:09,530
stuff like this and I totally appreciate

76
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:13,459
it they want they want me to talk about

77
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:15,169
it here in the vlog and it gives me

78
00:04:15,169 --> 00:04:16,579
stuff to talk about it's like a total

79
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:18,620
win-win but I also think that there's

80
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:21,139
like there's definitely a risk on the

81
00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:24,680
company's part because I mean if I like

82
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,060
it I'm gonna I'm gonna tell you guys

83
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:30,320
that I actually like it but if let's get

84
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:30,680
into it

85
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,840
hovercamp a sport the hover camera

86
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,180
passport isn't an aerial drone it isn't

87
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:39,320
a selfie stick

actually before I fly this thing just in

91
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,169
case I totally destroy it like I did

92
00:04:51,169 --> 00:04:53,330
with the last little drunk let me do a

93
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:55,159
little walkthrough for you so you can

94
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:56,690
see what it looks like this is the

95
00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:00,500
camera right here it looks sort of like

96
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,349
a cell phone camera that's the camera on

97
00:05:03,349 --> 00:05:05,900
my cell phone and then that's the camera

98
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,750
on the passport how do I show you how

99
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,330
big this thing is this is my hand and

100
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:13,570
that's how big that is but this is

101

phantom 4 this is the passport it's tiny

102
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,960
unfold hover cam and hold it level press

104
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:38,720
well okay okay kind of amazing

before I take it outside I want to look

110
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:05,699
at this footage so far my review the

111
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:09,870
most fun drone I've ever played with all

112
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,129
right I don't know the practical

113
00:06:11,129 --> 00:06:12,750
applications of this thing yet cuz I

114
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:13,680
don't know if you can even fly it

115
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,020
outside but indoors is amazing it was

116
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,610
like crashing into the lights and

117
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:20,250
everything that never fell and then when

118
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,590
I just I grabbed it because there's no

119
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:28,379
propellers ok checking out the video

120
00:06:28,379 --> 00:06:31,510
quality now I would describe it as like

121
00:06:31,510 --> 00:07:03,810
[Music]

122
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:07,060
it looks like a good cell phone video

123
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,710
camera that's what it looks like

124
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:10,510
like it's pretty crispy it's pretty

125
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:13,090
smooth oh another detail I did only

126
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:15,850
shoot in 1080 because the 4k is not

127
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:16,720
stabilized

128
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,130
I'd rather have a 1080 picture that

129
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:21,400
stabilized in a 14-1 that's shaky so far

130
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,790
so good though I'm gonna take it outside

after having had a chance to dive into

137
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,820
the footage from the from the passport

138
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:24,160
it's not terrible but it's not the video

139
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,710
is not great the photos stellar video

140
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:28,660
not great they did stress me quite a few

141
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:31,240
times this is not like a DJI or a GoPro

142
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,310
drone this is meant to be something for

143
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:35,470
people who are casual and want a selfie

144
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:37,900
and for that it's amazing I even think

145
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,580
this could be good for like younger

146
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,320
people or up-and-coming youtubers that

147
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,120
just wants something that's easy and to

148
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,710
give them some shot variety could be

149
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:46,810
great it won't be replacing my phantom

150
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:48,550
for any time soon

151
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:51,280
but I will find a use for this is the

152
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,720
most fun drone I've ever flown
