1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:10,809
50 fucking seconds of celestially themed

2
00:00:10,809 --> 00:00:11,440
logos

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,350
everyone was warned but no one listens

4
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:15,879
so we will keep making whether disaster

5
00:00:15,879 --> 00:00:18,250
films until you listen congress also

6
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:20,439
narration and also also blatant

7
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:21,880
exposition ok movie are you just gonna

8
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:22,930
write this for us

9
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:24,490
well there later be some asshole

10
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:25,900
graduating from the Prometheus school

11
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,460
running away from things while eating an

12
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,470
apple and not getting a lap dance a rise

13
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:32,590
in temperature ocean patterns changed

14
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:35,649
and ice caps melted leading to what I

15
00:00:35,649 --> 00:00:37,690
can only assume is an inconvenient geo

16
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:41,200
storm floods and droughts sounds like we

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,460
just need to take the floods where there

18
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:43,989
are droughts and routes where there are

19
00:00:43,989 --> 00:00:45,399
floods then they'll cancel each other

20
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:45,670
out

21
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:47,890
you're welcome planet rip East whoever

22
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:50,559
swallowed lower Manhattan but we could

23
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:51,850
only provide this found footage style

24
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:54,010
reenactment because Dean Devlin's got to

25
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:55,149
spend the majority of his Geo storm

26
00:00:55,149 --> 00:00:56,829
budget on the Geo storm and Gerard

27
00:00:56,829 --> 00:00:58,570
Butler's half beard oil I Hate Waste

28
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:01,239
you're 2 million people in Madrid in

29
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:02,079
just one day

30
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,269
wait did 2 million people not know how

31
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:06,430
hot it was outside or did this heatwave

32
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:08,170
arrived suddenly out of nowhere like a

33
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:10,060
shark attack the world came together as

34
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,400
one and had no idea that geo storm was

35
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,659
part of the bill and ted's expanded

36
00:01:13,659 --> 00:01:15,670
universe here was God gave rock'n'roll

37
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:17,200
to you broadcast to the universe I

38
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,750
always got the timelines confused it

39
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,369
gave the satellite net attacked in

40
00:01:21,369 --> 00:01:23,080
clinic but we all came to call it Dutch

41
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,360
boy after the story of the child who

42
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,130
floods a dam with his finger someone

43
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:28,540
pitch Sean Connery's character sir

44
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,760
August a winter from the 1998 Avengers

45
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,740
movie but it was discovered in 2019 that

46
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,330
that movie was even more obscure than

47
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:36,340
the Hans Brinker novels so Dutch boy 1

48
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,229
also this is apparently a sophisticated

49
00:01:38,229 --> 00:01:40,060
yada-yada net that does blah blah blah

50
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,500
the pearls the weather with a dumpling

51
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,110
series of thingamabobs so how is that

52
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:45,520
equivalent to sticking your finger in a

53
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,860
dike it was built by a team led by one

54
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:50,470
man and that man's name was geo storm

55
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:54,490
tornado zap blizzard zap you know what

56
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:55,960
would have made a way more awesome movie

57
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,939
the sky creating Dutch boy in showing us

58
00:01:57,939 --> 00:01:59,439
his invention zapping tornados and

59
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,150
blizzards but sure let's make this about

60
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,890
when Dutch boys go wrong and may the

61
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,840
record reflect that he was nearly one

62
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,880
hour late and why does it matter

63
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,500
nobody knows no one will ever speak of

64
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,390
it again then there was the incident

65
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:13,569
where you punched a federal inspector in

66
00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:15,549
the face I hate how this movie begins

67
00:02:15,549 --> 00:02:17,079
for a variety of reasons and hearing

68
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:18,519
about what a dick Jake is before we even

69
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:19,330
get to the amaze

70
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:21,340
part of his invention is one and despite

71
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,480
the fact that I believe our government

72
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,680
is useless I find it hard to believe

73
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,450
they'd be such hard asses - the guy who

74
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:27,400
saved the world the worst series of

75
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,950
storms building in Southeast Asia and in

76
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,330
North Atlantic that would have killed

77
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:34,240
tens of thousands of people that sounds

78
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,680
low considering that heat waves were

79
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,060
killing two million people in Madrid

80
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,560
alone okay where do you get that little

81
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,240
brother huh Jake helpfully verbally

82
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,710
identifies max as his little brother

83
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:43,030
within the first minute of dialogue

84
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,950
because this is a stupid action movie

85
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:46,690
that doesn't have time for subtlety is

86
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:48,160
for arthouse movies like Avengers

87
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,650
infinity war I told ya this had the

88
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:52,330
co-wallow is that all you told him

89
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:54,010
because how to talk to senators and

90
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:55,540
don't insult the Senators might have

91
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:56,860
been a good conversation to have if they

92
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,360
can control the weather so expertly why

93
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,830
are there even wide swaths of desert

94
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:00,490
anymore

95
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:01,690
are there still water shortages in

96
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:03,580
Africa are there no storms at all these

97
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,080
movie interested in explaining any of

98
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,580
this we find out later that this was

99
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,900
some sort of malfunction on dutchboy

100
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,730
that caused this but again much like the

101
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,020
heatwave that killed two million people

102
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,340
in Madrid I've got to wonder how this

103
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,720
happened so quickly that people are

104
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,610
frozen instantly it's not even anyone

105
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,260
running or looking up to the sky because

106
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,880
it happened that fast and what about the

107
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,440
surrounding heat how does the satellite

108
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,690
block the Sun from hitting the spot no I

109
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,670
no need to check on these guys to see if

110
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,050
there's any sign of life even though

111
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:27,550
this is clearly a freaking Amelie you

112
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:29,140
and recon team found it mr. president

113
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,820
I'm convinced that at this stage in his

114
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,620
career Andy Garcia is only agreeing to

115
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,330
roles that feature less than five total

116
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:36,010
minutes of screen time with this many

117
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,360
people in the loop I'm not sure how long

118
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,550
it's going to keep ah Christoph also

119
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:41,440
seriously these two acting legends

120
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,360
finally share a movie and it's king geo

121
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,250
storm I will not be the president that

122
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,739
hands over damaged goods Andy Garcia is

123
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:49,209
the president that we deserve but he's

124
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:50,920
not the one we need right now seventeen

125
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,480
countries had teams working on dutchboy

126
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,010
they all reported to him nobody knows

127
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:55,180
what's under the hood better than half

128
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,680
manipulates position no one will be

129
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,060
seated during the International Space

130
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,680
Station replaces the Afghanistan

131
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,989
satellite scene this Bulls Starship

132
00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:03,310
Troopers taught me anything it was that

133
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,690
in the future there would be unisex

134
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:05,260
locker rooms

135
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,330
I feel so deceived and I thought I told

136
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,520
you not to talk to strangers even at 13

137
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,870
Hannah can clearly understand how

138
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,220
fucking hokey this dialogue is

139
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,870
government authority figure has to track

140
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:14,950
down the one person who can do the job

141
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:16,419
but he's living in a shack in Florida

142
00:04:16,419 --> 00:04:17,859
and working on a vintage car cliche

143
00:04:17,859 --> 00:04:19,840
dutchboy was all you ever gave a damn

144
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,640
about the perils of calling your movie

145
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,470
tech dutchboy is that it requires actors

146
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,450
to repeatedly say dutch-born okay

147
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:27,340
well then what are you doing living out

148
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:31,870
here hmm damn that's a convenient ass

149
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,700
rocket launch hang on not only is this

150
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,720
2022

151
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,400
but this workstation is in what has to

152
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,720
be one of the most technologically

153
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,190
advanced buildings in the world and they

154
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,510
still use landlines that look like

155
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:42,430
they're from 1996 yeah I do much

156
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:45,100
parenting oh boy a bad father looks like

157
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,690
you've got some emmerich in my devlin of

158
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:48,190
course it's very possible the bad father

159
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,960
thing was always Devlin but I just want

160
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,190
to blame roland emmerich for everything

161
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,320
think of it like I'm going on a vacation

162
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,840
for a week or two this movie's discount

163
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,760
interstellar it's the same problem Earth

164
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,470
has the environment and a really smart

165
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:00,940
little girls dad has to go into space to

166
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,170
make it all better I hope we get to see

167
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:04,090
crying Gerard Butler later in the not so

168
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:06,610
distant future next Sunday ad the US has

169
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,650
enough money in 430 launching pads with

170
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,480
their own dedicated rocket at what point

171
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,070
does any country need this many rockets

172
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,630
on call even if they have a complex

173
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,430
weather controlling gadget in space have

174
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,620
a safe trip sir an holy Jake's the only

175
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,450
asshole flying in the ship couldn't they

176
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:20,620
have scheduled this one the other rocket

177
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,120
was flying to space a minute ago or is

178
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,500
this just a luxury you can afford when

179
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,210
you have 117 rockets lying around

180
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:26,920
oh yeah this reminds me this Jake's body

181
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,510
even ready to go to space after three

182
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,100
years of beer-swilling and bad parenting

183
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,990
okay up until now the effects have been

184
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:33,820
surprisingly passable but the shot looks

185
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:34,960
like it belongs on a Saturday morning

186
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,370
cartoon show on the CW look at you girl

187
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:40,600
sure it sounds all cool coming out of

188
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,070
the drawer but Lou's mouth but I get

189
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,330
slapped with a restraining order when I

190
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:44,890
say this to my college girlfriend well I

191
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:46,960
thought she was sleeping oh maybe I need

192
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,460
to speak to your chief scientists about

193
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,650
the fine art of giving a shit I'm the

194
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,120
chief scientist I've been promoted to

195
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,890
here ago here's bad movie logic for you

196
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,960
Jake is approached by his brother max to

197
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,280
go back to the place he was fired from

198
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,750
before we know it he's on a ship by

199
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,610
himself flying to that place and now

200
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,260
he's talking to the chief scientist but

201
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,910
was never briefed on what's changed or

202
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:05,770
who's in charge oh of course

203
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:08,200
an American actually my brother and I

204
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,910
were born in the UK this line was

205
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,530
definitely inserted to explain Gerard

206
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:13,000
Butler's dialect in this movie after it

207
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,560
was screened okay maybe not definitely

208
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,970
but you would totally believe that

209
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:17,350
wouldn't you you are

210
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:19,750
this is mr. Jake Lawson and he might be

211
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:20,920
one of the most famous men in the world

212
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,540
after he saved it so it's really strange

213
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,980
that people like you who work on Dutch

214
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:24,940
boy you don't know who he is

215
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,980
max jumps into bed unshaven with rumpled

216
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,630
hair and a wrinkled t-shirt Sarah is

217
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:30,040
posing perfectly on the bed with her

218
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,110
nightgown and cleavage just so and not a

219
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,910
hair out of place but they both equally

220
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:36,310
want to fuck right now far worse and the

221
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:39,160
very thing we're trying to prevent wait

222
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,530
what was that a Geo storm aha are all

223
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:43,240
those credits also how the fuck would

224
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,590
max have never heard about this

225
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:45,160
possibility

226
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,660
he runs the goddamn department that

227
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,550
handles the POTUS called a last minute

228
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:52,030
press parade why you can't stay despite

229
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:53,320
getting the warning from Chang seeing

230
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,820
the destruction on TV and being informed

231
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,410
of an emergency meeting called by the

232
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:58,150
president max is still in full-on

233
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,860
flirtation mode proving once again that

234
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,060
the power of boners is greater than the

235
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,830
power of Geo storms that's my fave

236
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:05,800
actually I call it a rock and roll aah I

237
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,660
prefer to call it NIMS island or the

238
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,100
ugly truth since we're obviously just

239
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,510
calling things by Gerard Butler movie

240
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:12,940
titles now it looks like bad servo

241
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,920
relayer drunk sailor man for a movie

242
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,390
about a catastrophic weather event there

243
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:18,610
is a lot of computer porn tell no one

244
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:20,470
yeah especially since I'm brazenly

245
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:22,180
waving my little secret access thingy

246
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,440
and having this discussion in a

247
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,480
completely open environment Oh whew with

248
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,460
this hologram screen how is this better

249
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,080
hey guys I want a machine that controls

250
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,640
the weather around the world and also I

251
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,260
want to join hallway filling hologram

252
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,910
screen so that I can talk to earth while

253
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:35,110
looking at a blurry glittery image

254
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:37,540
actually you'll be reporting to max here

255
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,290
good luck

256
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:40,510
so what was the purpose of this urgent

257
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,980
call just to tell Jake that his brothers

258
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,420
in charge how does he not already know

259
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,010
this just because he wanted it to be

260
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:47,590
someone else just one week after mom and

261
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:49,570
dad died you got arrested for fighting

262
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:51,370
expositional arguing but if you ever

263
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,850
authorize anything without my approval

264
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:56,350
we on the next shuttle nine and we'll

265
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,060
all be dead because of Geo storm but I

266
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,680
will have taught you a goddamn listen do

267
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,090
you movie if you're gonna show me that

268
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:02,530
the satellite is this big and it's about

269
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:04,000
to ram into these people in this shot

270
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,830
don't tell me it's this far away in the

271
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,360
next shop did this walk away double in

272
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,220
size between cuts granted I've never

273
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,290
spaced before but it is a vacuum right

274
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,240
after the first panel blew shouldn't

275
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,380
this dude have been sucked out of that

276
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,940
opening or does space have a dramatic

277
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:18,070
sense of timing it was terrific in 2001

278
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:18,760
a Space Odyssey

279
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,010
step across the gravity threshold why

280
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:22,690
does the spacewalk require the two most

281
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:23,890
important people in the dutchboy

282
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:25,240
operation I can't this be some

283
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,620
designated maintenance people especially

284
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,240
since the world has so much money to run

285
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,010
this shuttle people back and forth daily

286
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,080
let's just get the panels and see what's

287
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,330
on those drives I'm stating the exact

288
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:36,040
mission that you just told us 30 seconds

289
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,660
ago in case anyone has that memento

290
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,250
condition in the theater also it's

291
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,930
absolutely totally fucking amazing that

292
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:42,099
no one's bothered to get this panel

293
00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:43,719
until now this happened a week ago

294
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:44,950
Jake's known for some time that

295
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:46,480
someone's sabotaging everything on

296
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,050
dutchboy

297
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:48,790
he suspected it before he boarded

298
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,350
got confirmation from his brother and

299
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:51,880
got first-hand experience with it when

300
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,470
the satellite went haywire at this point

301
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:54,700
I don't know why he trusts anyone

302
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,320
and every mission should be taken with

303
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,580
the idea that someone doesn't want him

304
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:02,110
to figure out what the evil plan is and

305
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:04,150
I think they were gone for the terror of

306
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,830
gravity but ended up with a comedy at

307
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,540
The Three Stooges in orbit why didn't

308
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,340
you tell them about the drive because

309
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,590
someone just tried to kill me yeah but

310
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,450
why did you tell her about it oh it's

311
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:15,010
because she's pretty she can't be evil

312
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:15,580
got it

313
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,960
you've been locked out what the hell

314
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,460
does this movie want to be sci-fi

315
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,410
thriller apocalyptic effects fest a

316
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:22,090
geopolitical whodunit make up your

317
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:23,530
goddamn mind movie just like Jim

318
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,150
Sturgess is just using this movie as an

319
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,560
excuse to try out different hairstyles

320
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,750
oh come on

321
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,040
this guy's been tracking Channing the

322
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,630
whole time from Hong Kong to Washington

323
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,100
he could have killed this dude in so

324
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,780
many other ways and privately this is

325
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:37,420
agent Wilson yes I know right now that

326
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,070
sir I have to identify herself as an

327
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:41,140
agent can't you just call 9-1-1 abbie

328
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,510
cornish t1000 of course dad was a

329
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:45,610
government spy his whole life caught me

330
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:47,410
red-handed it really is incredible to

331
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:48,700
hear Gerard Butler's American and

332
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,050
Scottish accents battle each other in

333
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:52,030
real time his cell phone number is the

334
00:09:52,030 --> 00:10:00,610
key even if I allow Jake memorizing this

335
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:02,290
fake phishing story down to the precise

336
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:03,850
word so that his brother could crack it

337
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:05,530
using their dad's old cell phone number

338
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:07,120
I find it a little hard to believe that

339
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,320
the software they're using could figure

340
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,240
out stuff like red-handed or no one

341
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,130
being one word and keeping the count

342
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:13,960
right for easy to cipher and even if I'm

343
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,430
wrong about that then I will bring up a

344
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:17,830
real nitpick how this video is in no way

345
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:19,240
how Gerard Butler performed it in the

346
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,680
movie a minute ago so I'm sending

347
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,450
something about this god damn it sure

348
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:23,590
don't tell you're naturally suspicious

349
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,180
Secret Service girlfriend that you're

350
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,410
bringing a stranger to the house tonight

351
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:28,090
that can't ever end badly

352
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:32,080
I can explain everything what about that

353
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,010
statement is pervy

354
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:36,040
I mean if he'd said I was gonna well

355
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,130
we're in your my own gonna have the who

356
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:41,110
was gonna off the now that would be

357
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:43,000
perfect and you know that is bigger than

358
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,840
you you know shut up indeed shut up it

359
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,120
is you and me the easiest way to know is

360
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,770
to take the you and out of the sentence

361
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:52,240
and see if it holds up look being a

362
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,920
grammar nazi can be bad but being an

363
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,390
incorrect grammar nazi and I'm not

364
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:56,590
saying this because the actress is

365
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:58,030
German either so get that out of your

366
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:58,210
head

367
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:00,870
whoever did that killed my mother

368
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,460
and what makes you think it is not me

369
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,810
these are things completely innocent

370
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:06,060
people with guns say bingo looks more

371
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,800
like a dildo to me but I get those words

372
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,360
confused sometimes too it really gets

373
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,650
them riled up on Tuesday nights at the

374
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:12,990
assisted living center Geno storm why

375
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:14,520
can't anything we've ever seen have you

376
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:18,990
seen other geo storms sure no one in the

377
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:20,220
Secret Service is gonna care if you

378
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,660
leave your post with the president in

379
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,279
sight to go talk to someone everyone

380
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,779
knows is your boyfriend I've got this

381
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:26,279
Sara keeping the president safe doesn't

382
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:27,210
require a team effort

383
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:29,550
Jake these is to steal the kill codes

384
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:31,800
from Palma at least 70% of this movie is

385
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,330
people imploring other people to do

386
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:35,250
things to even other people Jesus people

387
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,810
just yelled geo storm and everyone will

388
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:38,610
understand I can still the convoys in

389
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:40,020
the shower awesome

390
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,130
I was wondering if we'd make it through

391
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:42,690
this slog without at least a little Andy

392
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:43,560
Garcia skin

393
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,150
we've lost ball control the Tokyo

394
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,920
satellite because it's the one city that

395
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,600
roland emmerich hasn't destroyed on film

396
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,490
and Dean Devlin has got to get his nut

397
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:52,830
on without using sloppy seconds max I

398
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:53,880
didn't know you were coming to the

399
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,470
convention I know max is high-level

400
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,180
State Department but this is Air Force

401
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,250
One and he's not on the manifest did

402
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,050
they let unexpected employees just tag

403
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:03,180
along on an impromptu basis I got if

404
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,440
there's not a helicopter shot of the

405
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,850
Christ the Redeemer statue getting blow

406
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,800
the fuck up in the scene I'm gonna ping

407
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,510
riot just under a minute ago we already

408
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:11,010
saw ice crashing into the beaches of Rio

409
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:13,110
so why is it still only this far inland

410
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:14,310
when we go back to it Dominic Toretto

411
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:16,200
should be frozen solid racing for pink

412
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,820
slips against a gang leader by now he

413
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,320
gets frozen a quarter-mile at a time man

414
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,060
I love how they set up this one hot

415
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,680
chick is the one person we should care

416
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,029
about during this Rio Country tropical

417
00:12:24,029 --> 00:12:26,040
freeze like literally the only character

418
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,300
trait that she has is that she's in a

419
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,980
bikini and she's hot and we saw her

420
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,180
boyfriend get frozen a minute ago so

421
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,930
we're planning moving in on that later

422
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:35,850
well damn we had a good streak there but

423
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:37,410
there goes HBM again I know what you're

424
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:38,580
saying but Jeremy this is a

425
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,959
malfunctioning weather satellite and I

426
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:41,790
say that's what I call HBO when it's not

427
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:42,870
playing new episodes of Game of Thrones

428
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:45,890
god damn it

429
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,500
one hour 30 minutes unfortunately no one

430
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,850
watching this movie was given the same

431
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:51,500
warning and many tens of people died

432
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,760
this is supposed to be a sophisticated

433
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,010
system right like shouldn't it be giving

434
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:56,300
latitude and longitude coordinates

435
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,830
instead of the metropolitan city name

436
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:59,540
it's gonna hit only within the city

437
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,580
limits of Orlando next I know everything

438
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,650
about you your father's death why'd you

439
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:04,339
lie to me

440
00:13:04,339 --> 00:13:05,750
well importantly why didn't you say

441
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,610
anything about it until now I gotta tell

442
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:08,390
you something

443
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:10,850
max violates Mubi rule 182 which is

444
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:12,770
never share info with that Harris when

445
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:14,180
you need someone you can trust and I

446
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,650
need the president has kill God we're

447
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:17,630
gonna shut down boy down now apparently

448
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,100
the only character trait listed for max

449
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,230
was constantly out of breath also if max

450
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:23,000
trusts Jackson Pollock why doesn't he

451
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,470
immediately tell him about the impending

452
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,940
storm that's headed directly toward them

453
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:28,760
president is a kill call biometric wait

454
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,020
they entrusted the entirety of the

455
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,910
global weather regulation to one person

456
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,230
I mean I know they pretty much do that

457
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,210
for nukes this seems like even more of a

458
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:36,860
stupid plan also this seems like a very

459
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,300
sensitive discussion to be having in the

460
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,650
middle of a crowded convention hall with

461
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:41,270
dozens of civilians and pres hanging

462
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:46,220
around thanks an important character who

463
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,600
shouts thinks I thought there might be a

464
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,800
way to control the satellites without

465
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,910
the station but you've set me straight

466
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:52,339
where's Duncan he's the only one with

467
00:13:52,339 --> 00:13:53,990
enough programming expertise to override

468
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:57,680
the commands done Oh like why you didn't

469
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,000
write out a list of the most obvious

470
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,440
suspects and this whole thing is beyond

471
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,300
me gonna figure this out in like a

472
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:07,490
couple hours probably pay this guy has

473
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:09,020
no problem killing pools left and right

474
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:11,029
but now at this critical moment sure why

475
00:14:11,029 --> 00:14:12,440
not lay out your motivations before

476
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,089
capping Olympus has fallen here also

477
00:14:14,089 --> 00:14:15,620
earlier they ruled out the French guy

478
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:16,940
because Jake figured he'd have been dead

479
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,279
already if it was him so why is that not

480
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,779
true for the British guy oh wait I

481
00:14:20,779 --> 00:14:22,040
remember this in A Tale of Two Cities

482
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,140
somewhere something about French guys

483
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,760
kill you instantly British guys let you

484
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,320
live and tell you the plan before they

485
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,550
attempt to kill you

486
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:30,470
I think Charles Darnay says that are you

487
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,560
a little bit curious to watch the world

488
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,120
but you know I've heard a lot of Michael

489
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,350
Caine impressions and this is the worst

490
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:38,029
one yet even though the satellite is

491
00:14:38,029 --> 00:14:39,589
blowing up and the Geo storm is imminent

492
00:14:39,589 --> 00:14:41,330
and the world is in peril and president

493
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:42,860
Garcia's in the middle of a dope speech

494
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:45,560
at the DNC we've got time for an orbital

495
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,140
fistfight

496
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,610
and try and tell you anything else man

497
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:51,440
this is some ham-handed from deck I'm

498
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,850
here bringing up Chang's name

499
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,440
he has max all to himself and all he's

500
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,210
got to do is get him behind closed doors

501
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:58,100
and end this motherfucker but instead he

502
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,900
gives away that he's the bad guy as if

503
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,660
being Ed Harris wasn't enough we're

504
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:04,100
leaving her post again how is Sarah not

505
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,720
fired already kidnapped the president

506
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,490
that sounds reasonable well it's the

507
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,750
only move we've got between the

508
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,100
whispered breathless dialogue and the

509
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,780
bonkers political abduction strategy you

510
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,190
could easily convince me this was an

511
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:15,050
episode of 24 and sure seemed like a

512
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:16,610
good idea but Sarah took out at least

513
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:18,140
four good lighting guys wait how did

514
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,880
Jake catch up to the entire crew he

515
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,860
ordered evac like 10 minutes ago and had

516
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,270
the confrontation the fistfight with

517
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:25,040
anonymous British guy number one so he

518
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,920
should be way behind everyone I'm sorry

519
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,360
you need to come with me I swear to God

520
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,740
that I've seen abbie cornish actually

521
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,420
act but the effects of Geo store are

522
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,100
apparently far too strong and it's like

523
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,480
those little wooden lift gates don't do

524
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,130
anything to deter rogue agents that

525
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:41,180
kidnap the president suddenly the Koch

526
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,170
brothers just got unexpected

527
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:46,250
simultaneous erections god dammit does

528
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,720
every one of these disaster movies have

529
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,880
to have a lost dog sub sub sub plot it's

530
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,680
like we care if the one dog gets saved

531
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,060
but we forget about the millions already

532
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,980
dead from this by the way I'm lumping in

533
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,240
all the in case you confused it with

534
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,950
sins here because this movie has so many

535
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:59,720
it's worse than a Bourne movie but in

536
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,339
case you confused with Moscow New

537
00:16:01,339 --> 00:16:03,080
Hampshire and ten sends more from me

538
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:03,530
please

539
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:05,000
having my brother and I lead the

540
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,700
investigation was a setup from the start

541
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,980
think about he hired us to fail I hire

542
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,990
anybody except people he could control

543
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:13,940
he'd put a mole on dutchboy and while

544
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,500
that sounds dirty that's what he did he

545
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,640
had people inside the Secret Service

546
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,680
working for why not hire Jim Joe Bob

547
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,390
Benedict Darrell the guy with a degree

548
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:22,250
in science from State College this is a

549
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,380
super speaking plan as if the John

550
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:26,089
Cusack drives a car through buildings

551
00:16:26,089 --> 00:16:27,530
while avoiding crashing over past the

552
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:29,210
scene in 2012 wasn't enough

553
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:31,250
Dean Devlin reaches down deep and works

554
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,690
up the courage to do a miniature version

555
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:34,940
for this movie we need to go we haven't

556
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,980
heard from him in hours I trust him who

557
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,810
gives it about trusting him the man

558
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:40,670
might be dead or unconscious or having

559
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:42,440
sex with heavy kornish all these things

560
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,700
would prevent him from making the call

561
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,529
after answered it manual yet

562
00:16:45,529 --> 00:16:47,689
the mainframe I mean it's not my type of

563
00:16:47,689 --> 00:16:49,189
dirty talk but whatever gets you going

564
00:16:49,189 --> 00:16:52,399
I'll be the sole survivor ready to be

565
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,079
sworn in as the next president of the

566
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,029
United States I'm just wondering what

567
00:16:56,029 --> 00:16:57,800
was Dec UM's planned before max told him

568
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,149
he knew something was up I guess he was

569
00:16:59,149 --> 00:17:00,439
just gonna slip out of the arena at the

570
00:17:00,439 --> 00:17:01,850
right time but why wasn't he already

571
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:03,410
gone before that the storm began well

572
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:04,819
before Deckman confronted max about

573
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:06,380
lying about why he came to Orlando and

574
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,449
not long after that the arena exploded

575
00:17:08,449 --> 00:17:09,230
fine

576
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:10,490
I mean I know it's a Geo storm and

577
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:12,230
everything but if this storm does blow

578
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:13,370
over wouldn't there be an investigation

579
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:15,289
into the massive rocket launcher attack

580
00:17:15,289 --> 00:17:16,520
that ultimately killed the president

581
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,079
wouldn't there be at least an Oliver

582
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,650
Stone movie about it because I'm the

583
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:23,150
goddamn President of the United States

584
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:24,140
of America

585
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,000
well that and he had to people go

586
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,770
absolutely rogue and kidnap him away

587
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:29,990
from danger but yeah president America

588
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:31,970
you're done village what where did all

589
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:33,620
these assholes come from and even though

590
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,030
this is the president in all shouldn't

591
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:36,650
all the rescue personnel be helping the

592
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:38,690
entire city over Orlando didn't the fool

593
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,039
Moxley center blow up with all the

594
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:41,960
Democrats I'm turning the clock back to

595
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,020
1945 when America was a shining city on

596
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:47,360
a hill mega you know what my brother

597
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,649
would say what yeah he was a dick but we

598
00:17:51,649 --> 00:17:53,450
only realized he was a dick 17 minutes

599
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:53,780
ago

600
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,190
this punch hasn't earned this isn't

601
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:56,270
something that's been building the whole

602
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:57,919
movie oh yeah even though the bad guy

603
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:59,149
was already caught we've got several

604
00:17:59,149 --> 00:18:00,649
more minutes of Geo storming since the

605
00:18:00,649 --> 00:18:02,240
movie neglected the Geo storm for most

606
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,740
of its runtime the day after tomorrow a

607
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,720
3d Tomorrow Never Dies Station

608
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,909
self-destruct can't be reversed well it

609
00:18:07,909 --> 00:18:09,409
can't look the only guy who could

610
00:18:09,409 --> 00:18:11,360
override it we got sucked into a vacuum

611
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,039
of space we really should have hired

612
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,510
more IT guys why does some of the

613
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,250
satellites send out storms but some of

614
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:19,309
them get all stark Hillary I know all

615
00:18:19,309 --> 00:18:20,659
that talk about the manual insertion

616
00:18:20,659 --> 00:18:22,190
into the mainframe got you revved up

617
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:24,140
before but now it's not the time what

618
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:27,799
are you doing I told you yeah sure but

619
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:28,850
what have you been doing the whole time

620
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:30,679
as soon as the last shuttle left you

621
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:32,510
could have been like Here I am bitch but

622
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:33,710
instead you hung around doing nothing

623
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:35,570
until springing your surprise at the

624
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:36,770
last minute it should come as no

625
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:38,600
surprise but this countdown clock is

626
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,520
total bull anyone who relies on this

627

Santaland all you want but if Jay can do

630
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:49,399
to escape this then you are lying so

631
00:18:49,399 --> 00:18:51,559

634

640
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:09,090
Geo kind you can't undo the past they

641

set up this girl to be more than a

bookend narrator and daughter who's

643
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,230
worried about her dad the whole movie

644
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:15,690
but they didn't pity what a waste and

645
