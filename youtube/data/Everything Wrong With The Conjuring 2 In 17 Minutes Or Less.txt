your movie seem like they're based on a

00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,519
true story dig up the Warrens connection

10
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:23,140
to the Amityville Horror a story that

11
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:23,949
has been questioned about its

12
00:00:23,949 --> 00:00:26,019
authenticity for decades discount Joseph

get started

15
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,239
character at a movie at 1:39 marks is

16
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:33,400
what I said at the zero zero zero mark

17
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,950
envision yourself in a halo of glowing

18
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:41,560
white lies it will protect you don't cut

19
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:47,170
scare I mean try not laughing during

20
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:49,120
this awful it's impossible movie proves

21
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,160
beer Farmiga has a way better imaginary

22
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,780
dream shotgun than you do by the way

23
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,460
this movie emulates the first Amityville

24
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:55,930
Horror in that the people sleeping

25
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,280
during all the shooting are the deepest

26
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,660
sleepiness motherfuckers in the world

27
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:00,310
you slow this down you can literally

28
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,960
spot a dozen different ways this mirror

29
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,920
shot is off what an asshole creepy ghost

30
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,509
kid laughing creepily in a horror movie

31
00:01:07,509 --> 00:01:10,120
cliche also what an asshole Jesus Christ

32
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,740
this is a vision right she can't even

33
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,270
keep up with a creeper kid and a vision

34
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:14,620
how's she gonna possibly hold her own

35
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,480
when this goes real life oh she's not

36
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,000
oculus again ah Kim Basinger I'm kind of

37
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,590
confused if fluorine gets strangled here

38
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:22,300
does she die in the matrix also somehow

39
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,740
even though I thought she was walking

40
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,420
through a previous murder from the past

41
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:27,010
this chick is still strangled by a white

42
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:28,720
face zombie none ghost born out of a

43
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,010
mirror and when you put it all in

44
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:31,630
writing yes it does seem pretty goddamn

45
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:33,670
ridiculous with stacks chairs like this

46
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:35,080
what kind of Jenga bolt is going on with

47
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,280
this furniture the people around the

48
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,870
table should not be buying this but that

49
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:39,370
halo of glowing light is probably

50
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:40,570
preventing them from being skeptical

51
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:42,580
this is close to hell as a everyone

52
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:46,710
again the end the end reading

54
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,440
Jesus Christ movie we get it we're in

55
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,330
London the song alone was overkill but

56
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:55,010
the British Invasion seizure was dead

57
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:56,120
horse beating levels of unnecessary

58
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,820
right Phalke get just a wanker the

59
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,410
audience look at this movie is going to

60
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:01,820
speak another language without giving me

61
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,200
any subtitles I might as well give up

62
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,640
can't just go into another country like

63
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,960
this and expect me to follow along with

64
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,640
my rudimentary understanding of whatever

65
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,660
language this is I feel like maybe this

66
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,010
movie isn't British enough this is a

67
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:14,540
nifty little shot here where we pan up

68
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,700
with mom into the hall window and threw

69
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,110
it into the bedroom then follow the

70
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,730
daughter back out into the hall my only

71
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:21,230
issue is that nothing in the story or

72
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:23,090
script of this movie comes close to

73
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:24,350
matching the creativity displayed here

74
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:25,910
in this shop the shot is above this

75
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,530
movie actually for being such a well

76
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:28,940
shot will be overall when we move us it

77
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,560
look it's bad enough we're conjuring The

78
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,760
Amityville Horror do we need two

79
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,590
conjuring to a discount Ouija board into

80
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,070
this thing

81
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,180
look if this movie's gonna go all

82
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,740
insidious on me why not just call this

83
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,270
insidious for you already got Patrick

84
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,770
Wilson so I'm already having a hard time

85
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:40,880
distinguishing this movie from those

86
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,370
movies this kind of pounding would

87
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,510
definitely make me jump out of bed and

88
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:46,040
fear for my life but this girl don't

89
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,990
give up if a movie opens with excessive

90
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,700
evidence the family is poor you can bank

91
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,170
on even more evidence piling up as you

92
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,390
go forward also a sweet spontaneous wet

93
00:02:53,390 --> 00:03:00,709
t-shirt contest I'm genetically

94
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:02,630
hardwired by logic to laugh out loud

95
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,340
whenever I hear the phrase ghost hunter

96
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,380
regardless of context and now we're

97
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:09,020
gonna talk to my next guest dr. Steven

98
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,390
Kaplan who says that the investigations

99
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:12,680
the Warrens conducted into the

100
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,140
Amityville haunting is a load of hogwash

101
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,180
then why isn't he the hero of the story

102
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,160
careful who you call a liar what are you

103
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:19,820
gonna do about it

104
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,530
fraud fight first night bang some doors

105
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:23,780
second night move a single swing it's

106
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,670
gonna be 17 or 1890 where these ghosts

107
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:27,140
do any real damage isn't it what are you

108
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,959
doing you playing a game with Billy

109
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:32,000
you're both here talking to her and

110
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,769
playing a game with Billy can wait you

111
00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:39,200
bored demons man how do they work

112
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,970
did she get over there that fast without

113
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:44,959
making any noise ah hutch this goes on

114
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:45,470
for some time

115
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,970
like most ghosts from the fiery depths

116
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:48,290
of hell this guy likes to play with

117
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:51,349
children's toys

118
00:03:51,349 --> 00:03:53,489
okay the kid turned it off and kicked it

119
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:54,900
into the tent now it's in his bedroom

120
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,640
and turned back on I might be weirded

121
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,709
out too but remember this is the 70s in

122
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:00,390
the 80s I had electronic toys doing

123
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:02,040
weird kid all the time America didn't

124
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,239
really master the glitch free

125
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:05,069
battery-powered toy until Teddy Ruxpin

126
00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:06,540
so this kid should at least be

127
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,799
considering the totally plausible

128
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:09,780
explanation of toy malfunction does this

129
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,069
movie know how sick sense it is right

130
00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:12,870
now I don't think it does because if it

131
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,189
did someone would have said something

132
00:04:14,189 --> 00:04:15,540
and this scene wouldn't be so sick since

133
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:21,000
right now audio-based jump-scare cue

134
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,830
movie check your D B's on it because I'm

135
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,630
thinking about suing your ass that was

136
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,820
loud also okay fine that was scary

137
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,470
unexpected and loud I felt like I was

138
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:30,449
gonna die but it's up with this dude if

139
00:04:30,449 --> 00:04:31,710
you want them out of the house show up

140
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:32,849
and scare Francis O'Connor

141
00:04:32,849 --> 00:04:34,199
no one believes kids unless they're in

142
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:35,610
the crucible those two really really

143
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:36,720
wants these people out of his house

144
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,250
decides to retire when the adult shows

145
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,440
up super poor family has giant house

146
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,880
with a television that has a goddamn

147
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,039
remote control in 1977

148
00:04:44,039 --> 00:04:45,900
it's like dad spent all the money just

149
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,190
hours before he skipped out on his

150
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,360
family that's the only reason I can

151
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,860
think of that they're so poor because

152
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,150
earlier mom said she had no money for

153
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:52,680
biscuits and even though she has twice

154
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,690
since produced magic biscuits she still

155
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:56,370
hasn't sold this fucking luxury TV and

156
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:57,630
forced her kids to seek entertainment in

157
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,340
their own imaginations every single

158
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,780
exterior establishing shot of this house

159
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,849
opens with a car zooming by everyone not

160
00:05:02,849 --> 00:05:04,050
to mention the fact that we already were

161
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,760
just inside the house let's see we've

162
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,080
got Queen Elizabeth family have a

163
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,789
stuttering British kid so this movie is

164
00:05:08,789 --> 00:05:09,990
basically the King's Speech when it

165
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:12,210
comes down to it Direct TV just reading

166
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:13,440
book dude I don't watch her you're

167
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,699
really enjoying that market doctor

168
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:17,569
speech anyway be honest

169
00:05:17,569 --> 00:05:19,789
okay but why spend so many days pounding

170
00:05:19,789 --> 00:05:21,199
on doors and rolling fire trucks around

171
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,580
if you have this serious appointment

172
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,169
also why does he give up after that why

173
00:05:24,169 --> 00:05:25,999
not appear behind here five six seven

174
00:05:25,999 --> 00:05:28,069
more times until she leaves hi Mona Lisa

175
00:05:28,069 --> 00:05:30,229
on Mac yeah I know I know the castle but

176
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:31,789
I didn't think it was that bad

177
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:33,559
this guy knows his wife like I know his

178
00:05:33,559 --> 00:05:35,659
wife wink wink nudge nudge say no more

179
00:05:35,659 --> 00:05:36,770
anyway he should know that her

180
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,209
disturbance has nothing to do with his

181
00:05:38,209 --> 00:05:40,189
shoe painting but what's in the painting

182
00:05:40,189 --> 00:05:42,800
you can still do the lectures no new

183
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,020
cases and by that I mean we will take a

184
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,520
new case ten minutes from now also

185
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,869
you're not gonna tell your husband that

186
00:05:47,869 --> 00:05:49,459
the nun he painted is the exact same

187
00:05:49,459 --> 00:05:50,629
done that strangled you with a Lutz

188
00:05:50,629 --> 00:05:52,969
house but why because if it's a TV shows

189
00:05:52,969 --> 00:05:56,869
another scary ghost and holy SH they

190
00:05:56,869 --> 00:06:00,229
talk to it okay okay first of all what

191
00:06:00,229 --> 00:06:01,819
if you sleep untie this middle school

192
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:03,319
now second of all why you acting like

193
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:04,520
you didn't literally see a remote

194
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,469
control moving old man ghosts earlier

195
00:06:06,469 --> 00:06:08,149
today did you tell anyone about that you

196
00:06:08,149 --> 00:06:10,300
think he's impervious to knots

197
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,709
once again they super loud pounding on

198
00:06:12,709 --> 00:06:13,879
the store not only doesn't wake the

199
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:15,289
entire house it doesn't even wake the

200
00:06:15,289 --> 00:06:17,209
sleeping sister in this room Janet knows

201
00:06:17,209 --> 00:06:18,589
this house is haunted but decides to

202
00:06:18,589 --> 00:06:21,669
walk through it in the dark anyway

203
00:06:21,669 --> 00:06:23,569
there's been a couple decent scares in

204
00:06:23,569 --> 00:06:24,949
this movie but now it resorts to the

205
00:06:24,949 --> 00:06:26,180
pulling the covers off and yelling

206
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,189
technique you two being with this god

207
00:06:28,189 --> 00:06:29,779
damn it are you going to forget the bite

208
00:06:29,779 --> 00:06:31,189
on your daughter's shoulder and I'll ask

209
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:31,519
again

210
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:33,379
does this go scaring the kids and not

211
00:06:33,379 --> 00:06:34,999
the adult for is it bad that I didn't

212
00:06:34,999 --> 00:06:36,139
realize there were two brothers until

213
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:37,309
just now can you imagine what a good

214
00:06:37,309 --> 00:06:38,240
scare that would have been if there

215
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,069
wasn't two brothers instead movies been

216
00:06:40,069 --> 00:06:41,899
so negligent with I think the taller one

217
00:06:41,899 --> 00:06:43,729
I had no idea until I rewound this movie

218
00:06:43,729 --> 00:06:44,899
and found this kid a couple other times

219
00:06:44,899 --> 00:06:47,409
playing in significant background filler

220
00:06:47,409 --> 00:06:49,639
finally bring me a check from the

221
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:51,229
kitchen would it be great if he went to

222
00:06:51,229 --> 00:06:52,699
get the chair and when he came back his

223
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:53,539
partner was murdered

224
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:55,309
haha maybe I should make horror movies

225
00:06:55,309 --> 00:06:58,759
no lice maybe this King idiot hears

226
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:00,289
Thunder rumbling in the house and then

227
00:07:00,289 --> 00:07:02,659
suggests mice and fires this difficult

228
00:07:02,659 --> 00:07:05,119
on the spot of the cop this dick had

229
00:07:05,119 --> 00:07:06,349
finally figured out if you need people

230
00:07:06,349 --> 00:07:07,759
to leave your house you do in front of

231
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,649
the authorities exterior shot suggest

232
00:07:09,649 --> 00:07:11,360
we're back in America for now but the

233
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,219
lack of rapid montage involving u.s.

234
00:07:13,219 --> 00:07:14,419
monuments over Jimi Hendrix's

235
00:07:14,419 --> 00:07:16,189
instrumental national anthem I can't be

236
00:07:16,189 --> 00:07:16,490
sure

237
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:17,719
Lorraine is transfixed by her daughter

238
00:07:17,719 --> 00:07:19,219
who's obviously transfixed towards

239
00:07:19,219 --> 00:07:20,539
something down the hall but this is a

240
00:07:20,539 --> 00:07:21,680
horror movie and Lorraine won't notice

241
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,969
the demon nun until after her daughter

242
00:07:22,969 --> 00:07:24,829
points it out after god knows how many

243
00:07:24,829 --> 00:07:26,479
years being thwarted by them the ghosts

244
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:27,889
have finally decided to haunt at the

245
00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:29,300
source of their enemies you ruined our

246
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,800
haunting now you must pay the price of

247
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,490
slam doors in

248
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:32,720
thuds in the night yeah we all know

249
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,039
where this is going right this goes to

250
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:35,539
understand symmetry Oh

251
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:36,889
laureen's been in the further this whole

252
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:38,210
time I got a question though

253
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:39,349
how did her daughter show up in her

254
00:07:39,349 --> 00:07:41,000
vision you telling me her vision has no

255
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,770
rules okay I don't like that so what's

256
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:47,569
stopping you also why even tell her

257
00:07:47,569 --> 00:07:49,099
these visions raise more questions than

258
00:07:49,099 --> 00:07:49,550
answers

259
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,500
TV crew captures haunting on film but I

260
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,970
guess the late 70s viewing audience

261
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:54,319
collectively cried Photoshop or

262
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,490
something mom looks concerned about her

263
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:00,259
daughter's health but Carrie on TV

264
00:08:00,259 --> 00:08:01,610
interview why is the sister still

265
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:02,780
looking at her obviously possessed

266
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,039
younger sibling like she's telling a

267
00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:05,330
story about girl scouts

268
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,590
why isn't older sister freaking the f

269
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:08,419
out I'm sure the haunting is plenty hot

270
00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:10,430
news in this community but no bread that

271
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,960
should get the entire front page by

272
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,460
itself and certainly top of the fold

273
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,110
placement over some soccer controversy

274
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:15,860
it won't help

275
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,330
really but isn't it about time they took

276
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,889
this tent down it's kind of a catalyst

277
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:20,389
for all bullshit boat isn't it this

278
00:08:20,389 --> 00:08:22,250
isn't creepy anymore you did this like

279
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,630
in the first 20 minutes and you've moved

280
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,130
on to possessing small children when I

281
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,930
go back to random toy degree is it just

282
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:28,430
a pad to the runtime if this dude shows

283
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,900
up as a guy carrying an umbrella all of

284
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,130
a sudden I'm officially done with this

285
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:32,690
movie if you can do this as a ghost you

286
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:34,130
can literally do anything it should have

287
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:37,490
won already based on the true story also

288
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:38,839
yeah I mean now we're talking about

289
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:39,979
transforming yourself into whatever

290
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:41,630
drawing is on a child's tour and this

291
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,399
isn't your house kind of a dick ghost

292
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:48,410
haunts the neighbor's house oh yeah it

293
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:50,450
was Janet all along wait what

294
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:51,800
this dude could clearly kill everyone

295
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,360
here and not even think about it but he

296
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,680
fails miserably and he basically just

297
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,660
causes damage and cleanup headaches and

298
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,880
there is a family in London that

299
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,529
desperately needs our help can you

300
00:09:00,529 --> 00:09:01,880
believe this movie is at the hour mark

301
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,140
and the Warrens aren't in London yet

302
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,149
this thing is over two hours I had a

303
00:09:05,149 --> 00:09:07,190
premonition of your death moulding

304
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:09,200
stalagmites come on we don't run from

305
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,180
fights this works I understand that

306
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,190
Janet is levitated did that happen in

307
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:14,810
here as well yeah more than once when

308
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:16,100
did that happen did we miss the

309
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,600
levitation are we talking about the time

310
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,459
when she fell in a bit fifty Christ

311
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:20,270
compels you

312
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,560
my ex-husband bought all the furniture

313
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,630
with the house when we moved in this

314
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,279
family unlike most horror families has

315
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,510
actually lived in this house for a while

316
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,980
now why did it take so long for this

317
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:31,970
goes to get pissed off and Oh believe me

318
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:33,620
it can hurt you but it's not going to

319
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,510
right now or anything he also told me he

320
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,920
can stop smoking any time he wants he

321
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,360
just doesn't want it demon makes them

322
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,800
all turn their backs because he's

323
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,329
suddenly shine there's no good reason

324
00:09:41,329 --> 00:09:42,980
except to have a unique perspective on

325
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,640
this demon interview scene let's go

326
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,750
down a business what are you saying

327
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:46,980
you're telling me no one has snuck a

328
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:53,550
peek yet you see this 50 crosses

329
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,230
upstairs don't deter this dude but this

330
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:57,510
one tiny cross does are you sensing a

331
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:59,880
presence no it's just the opposite I'm

332
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,130
not sensing anything all right how can

333
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:03,480
that be we could be looking at

334
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,910
hysterical neurosis that would explain

335
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:10,110
the multiple personalities no it

336
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,570
wouldn't she wouldn't do that

337
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:16,350
it helps me sleep Lisa no I'm not going

338
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,910
anywhere that's not what we saw earlier

339
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:21,180
you fell out of bed remember I'm sorry I

340
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,310
didn't believe say what you will these

341
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:24,330
hauntings appear to be good for

342
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:28,750
mother-daughter relationships

343
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:31,750
oh she's being haunted by st. Peter this

344
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,310
asshole needed a distraction in order to

345
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:35,980
scare the audience I mean Genet these

346
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,510
two must sleep like the dead how much

347
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:38,860
noise did they just sleep through here

348
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,390
like three minutes of solid petrified

349
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,370
screaming silly this dude's plan was to

350
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:44,260
suffocate her with curtains goddamn man

351
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,520
you just pulled her through the ceiling

352
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,870
into this room he transformed herself

353
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,880
into an illustration okay you just

354
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,980
killed something using your own powers

355
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,910
they're gonna believe her right

356
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:56,740
since this room was padlocked from the

357
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,090
outside and this girl was found

358
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,160
screaming and suffocating inside the

359
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,480
only other explanation is that the mom

360
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,770
did all this without the warrants down

361
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:04,180
the hall hearing anything and what about

362
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,320
the claims that Jenna has been

363
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,820
teleporting around the house in her

364
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,500
sleep you mean like last night when you

365
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,850
found her in the locked room what the

366
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:12,700
actual Jesus she teleported herself into

367
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,350
a room locked from the outside

368
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:16,060
easy discount gene Shalit I've already

369
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,530
covered this but good job copying me

370
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:19,720
she's gotta spit it out taken another

371
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,400
set before you turn back uh-huh I saw

372
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,110
the demon wants the humans to down his

373
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:24,910
existence what a weird-ass ghost man

374
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,860
he's literally just playing with them so

375
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,300
you really do believe them

376
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:31,480
yes we do Lorraine made and promised

377
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,860
before they came here that they believed

378
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,240
at the first sign of this haunting being

379
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,770
real yet here they are twelve hours in

380
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:37,630
at least could five pieces of true

381
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,220
haunting evidence yet neither has even

382
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:45,640
brought up the we should leave packed no

383
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,020
one would be seated during the Patrick

384
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:54,010
Wilson Elvis karaoke scene the fact that

385
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:55,300
this random leaning against the wall

386
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,430
generally unused guitar is in perfect

387
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:59,140
tune a Texan and a half to anyone that

388
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,820
ever played a guitar in real life though

389
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,380
for scorekeeping reasons well rounded up

390
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:05,110
to two it's so small and light har-har

391
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:07,150
did you ever worry that there might be

392
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:09,060
something hiding under your bed at night

393
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,589
yep he's actually fixing their plumbing

394
00:12:11,589 --> 00:12:12,850
while staying there as a ghost hunter

395
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:14,380
because Hollywood only knows one gear

396
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,970
when it comes to super good characters

397
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:17,470
and that's all the way baby look I'm

398
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,580
fine with the Warrens integrating

399
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,960
themselves into this family trying to

400
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,220
get them to think happy thoughts and all

401
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,980
that this movie waste so much time

402
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,480
this basement was absolutely constructed

403
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,040
with the specific goal of adding to the

404
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:27,970
tension of a horror film

405
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:29,530
I mean who builds that many half walls

406
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:31,330
with that many open board slots yeah

407
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:32,920
it's scary I just don't know why this

408
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,690
motherfucker has to creep anywhere he

409
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:35,980
could just transport himself over to Ed

410
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,420
and grab him right now if you wanted

411
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,190
haha I was gonna kill that but now I've

412
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:41,140
decided to kill you instead haha I'm so

413
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:41,470
great

414
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,150
she clearly got bit in this water but

415
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,620
he's casually feeling around like

416
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,270
there's a definite nearby plug drain or

417
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,260
a million-dollar heart of the sea

418
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,640
diamond down there he's back from the

419
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,840
grave because his business has

420
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,790
unfinished teeth even though this chair

421
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,140
is definitely evil and connected to the

422
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,730
ghost these assholes still put all the

423
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:56,320
Christmas tree decorations on it causing

424
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,270
Janet PTSD every trip back for a new

425
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:58,660
ornament

426
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:07,000
oh it's the brother she just teleported

427
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,740
into the next jump scare the producers

428
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,720
of this movie really hate chairs locked

429
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,250
doors are no match for Ed's average

430
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:15,400
human man strength I think there's

431
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,580
something wrong with your wiring movie

432
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,750
doesn't even try to show you how he

433
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,310
untangled her from all that mess this

434
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:22,900
video is offered as proof of Janet

435
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,760
faking it but if she's being possessed

436
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,620
as they've seen happen doesn't this

437
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,510
video basically prove nothing also does

438
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,860
anyone remember that a hall chair got

439
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,390
thrown on a line from the kitchen to the

440
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,980
living room and is this footage from

441
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,420
five minutes ago because so much more

442
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,560
happened during that scene plus her

443
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,700
brother was there and there was no

444
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,660
footage of how she got into that

445
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,730
impossible closet either a war the part

446
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:40,690
where she magically appeared in that

447
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:42,190
room or the bite marks which everyone

448
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:43,550
conveniently forgets

449
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:46,750
[Music]

450
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,209
movie offers a the old-timey cover of

451
00:13:49,209 --> 00:13:50,860
the wallflower song from Zoolander is

452
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,269
this movie seriously about to turn on

453
00:13:52,269 --> 00:13:53,860
him seeing a spilled tape in the shape

454
00:13:53,860 --> 00:14:00,819
of a cross really x marks the spot come

455
00:14:00,819 --> 00:14:02,709
on I can see that this is clever but why

456
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:04,269
would he leave out specific words two

457
00:14:04,269 --> 00:14:05,680
different times that when combined

458
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,449
magically form one message what kind of

459
00:14:07,449 --> 00:14:08,889
convenient ghost affliction causes this

460
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:11,589
oh now you'll feel the presence you mean

461
00:14:11,589 --> 00:14:12,790
this whole thing was a ruse to get the

462
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,410
Warrens out here so that this demon non

463
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:16,240
could kill it geez never considered

464
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,120
working in America she survives this

465
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,769
thunder and lightning storm during the

466
00:14:20,769 --> 00:14:23,170
climax get out of here the site is being

467
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:25,180
blocked by the inhuman spirit it's just

468
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,860
unfortunate that her site which detects

469
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,360
inhuman spirits was blocked by an

470
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,980
inhuman spirit that's annoying the

471
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,839
demon's name gives us power over and we

472
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,269
can cast it out yeah really okay

473
00:14:34,269 --> 00:14:36,009
whatever I'm up for whatever at this

474
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:37,480
point I mean Denzel could start

475
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,829
narrating is one of these characters and

476
00:14:38,829 --> 00:14:40,449
this could be a huge fallen prequel at

477
00:14:40,449 --> 00:14:41,920
this point I wouldn't carry your name

478
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,439
you didn't ask for it it was given this

479
00:14:44,439 --> 00:14:46,540
is the fastest solvable riddle since bat

480
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,699
killer in Batman Forever no ed use your

481
00:14:48,699 --> 00:14:50,649
god-given door breaking hands demon that

482
00:14:50,649 --> 00:14:51,639
went through all the trouble of throwing

483
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:53,079
a couch in front of a window a minute

484
00:14:53,079 --> 00:14:54,670
ago somehow can't stop it from breaking

485
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:56,680
through a floor steam burns at Warren

486
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,000
giving him conveniently blurry vision

487
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,199
for the last several minutes of this

488
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:00,730
over bloom bolt Edie is clearly

489
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:01,839
oblivious to the Red Power Ranger

490
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,850
stalking him from behind I'm kind of

491
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:05,170
impressed by the new Power Rangers

492
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,579
reboots marketing department here so

493
00:15:06,579 --> 00:15:08,559
I'll let it slide yeah no I won't and

494
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:10,480
some people said it would take 600 years

495
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,040
to cut through this door with a tiny axe

496
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:16,149
old Andy did it in less than 20 find the

497
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:17,379
hell with a demon teller its name

498
00:15:17,379 --> 00:15:19,120
considering the power uname possesses in

499
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,389
this world well no you've stamped your

500

504
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:34,610
figured who buys a new Bible

505
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:36,680
those are the exact letters on a

506
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,120
bookcase from earlier you mean they just

507
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,200
happen to decorate their bookshelves

508
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,579
with the five letters of the demon

509
00:15:40,579 --> 00:15:42,170
they're chasing or did the demon do this

510
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:43,790
because it really wants to tell her its

511
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:44,899
name for some reason do they have other

512
00:15:44,899 --> 00:15:46,100
letters strewn about the house or just

513
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,899

516
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,899
