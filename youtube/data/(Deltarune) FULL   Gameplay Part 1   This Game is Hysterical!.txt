1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,600
H-h-h-how's it going bros, my name is Pewdiepie!

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,680
And welcome to another gameplay on this channel!

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,880
I know a lot of you guys have been waiting for this.

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,800
No, for real I've been. *chuckles*

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,020
UNDERTALE 2!!!

6
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:16,080
So, this game came out, it's called &quot;Deltarune.&quot;

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,480
It's... basically Undertale 2.

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,680
I think... I'm not sure....

9
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,200
Uh, they released chapter 1.

10
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,640
But i-i-t's not just a chapter, it's an actual full game.

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,140
As far as i can- I know, it's 2 hours or something long, so...

12
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,320
I'm freakin' pumped!

13
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,460
Uh, I loved playing Undertale,
I think a lot of people enjoyed it as well.

14
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,420
So let's just jump into it.

15
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:43,000
I wanna just show this, just cuz when you
install the game it says &quot;SURVEY_PROGRAM&quot;.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,400
&quot;YOU ACCEPT EVERYTHING THAT WILL HAPPEN FROM NOW ON.&quot;

17
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:51,440
Yes, except... I won't accept putting on Start Menu Shortcut.

18
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,640
That was an actual joke.

19
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,400
Let's do this...

20
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,520
Okay.

21
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,840
Oh God! What did it say?

22
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,180
I was adjusting my window.

23
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:03,760
&quot;Are we ready... connected?

24
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,960
It's almost the same.

25
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,340
I guess we are.

26
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,840
Ok! It's, Undertale.

27
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,660
Ok, this is epic!

28
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:16,880
&quot;Excellent.&quot;

29
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:23,060
Where is Sans? Come on.
&quot;Truly excellent.&quot;

30
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,960
&quot;Now.&quot;

31
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,080
Now what? &quot;We may begin.&quot;

32
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:29,940
*exitedly claps*

33
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,900
I know the future everyone, guys.

34
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:36,720
Oh, Jesus!

35
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,320
&quot;First.&quot;

36
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:43,160
&quot;You must create a vessel.&quot;

37
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,860
Okay.

38
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:47,860
&quot;Select the head that you prefer.&quot;

39
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:52,040
Alright, we got....

40
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,320
Mmm... this one.

41
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,300
&quot;Select the torso that you prefer.&quot;

42
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:02,300
Wow! There's so many different options!
How could I possibly pick one?

43
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,800
Hmm... Hmm..! I think-!

44
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,880
I think I'll go-

45
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,140
I think I'll go with that one.

46
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:14,200
&quot;Select the legs.&quot; Oh wow!
There are so many different options!

47
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,580
How could I possibly pick one?

48
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:21,500
&quot;This is your body.&quot;

49
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:26,000
&quot;Do you accept it?&quot; Well, does anyone truly accept their body?

50
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,880
That was so deep.... &quot;Excellent.&quot;

51
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,960
&quot;You have created a wonderful form.&quot; Why, thank you, that's the first time anyone told me that.

52
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,840
&quot;Now.&quot;

53
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,620
Except when I go to the bathroom.
&quot;Let us shape...

54
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,300
&quot;...its mind...&quot;

55
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,140
as your own.&quot;

56
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:45,480
&quot;What is its favourite food?&quot;

57
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,140
Uhhm...

58
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,460
Pain.

59
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,500
Taste's good right?

60
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,300
&quot;Your favorite blood type?&quot;

61
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,780
Uhh...

62
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,440
I think I'm B, I'm not sure....

63
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:59,540
Favorite blood type... &quot;What color does it like the most?&quot;

64
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:02,020
Cyan is pretty interesting.

65
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,720
&quot;Please give it a gift.&quot;

66
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,600
A gift of... mind.

67
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,540
I'll be a psychic Pokemon.

68
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:17,080
&quot;How do you feel about your creation? (It will not hear.)&quot;

69
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,880
Are you sure? *laughs*

70
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:23,000
I... I'm hopeful.

71
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,080
&quot;Have you answered honestly?&quot;

72
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,580
Uhh...

73
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,600
Yeah, I think so....

74
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:33,260
&quot;You acknowledge the possibility of pain and seizure?&quot;

75
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:36,600
Uhh...

76
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,580
No.

77
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:41,640
&quot;Understood.&quot;

78
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,920
&quot;Name your vessel.&quot;

79
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,840
Uhh...

80
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,000
Well... of course, you know what's happening.

81
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,800
You know what's... has to be.

82
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,380
The legend has to return.

83
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,380
Do not say the word.

84
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:56,780
Oh!

85
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:00,140
&quot;We called it 'SALADASS.'&quot;

86
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,520
We?

87
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:05,720
&quot;And what about the creator?&quot;

88
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,640
&quot;Your own name.&quot;

89
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:12,420
Oh... well I guess I'll pick 'Felix.'

90
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,220
Just cuz usually these games are really meta.

91
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,360
So I want it to play into that.

92
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,680
&quot;'Felix.'&quot;

93
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,000
What a silly na- &quot;Excellent.&quot;

94
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,500
Yes.

95
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,300
Thank you for not ripping into my name.

96
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,000
&quot;Truly excellent.&quot;

97
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,700
&quot;'Felix.'&quot;

98
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,500
&quot;Thank you for your time.&quot;

99
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,540
You're welcome.

100
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:33,840
Now let's get on with the game.

101
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,840
&quot;Your answers&quot;

102
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,880
&quot;Your wonderful... creation!&quot;

103
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,780
&quot;Will now be discar-...&quot;

104
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,440
DAMMIT! *laughs*

105
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,780
&quot;No one can choose who they are in this world.&quot;

106
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,540
Are you kidding me?!

107
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:52,060
&quot;Your name is&quot;

108
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,720
God...

109
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,300
&quot;Kris!&quot;

110
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,460
It's cow-mom!

111
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,160
Alright... this is...

112
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,300
(Anime voice) &quot;Kris, if you-&quot;

113
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:09,800
(Normal voice) &quot;Kris, if you do not wake up, we will be late for school!&quot;

114
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,200
&quot;I will wait outside for you, alright?&quot;

115
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:18,920
So... this is Undertale...
or... is it not... I can't....

116
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,640
Alright, let's look around.

117
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,520
&quot;It's a beautiful day outsi-&quot; Man I miss this.

118
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,320
The style and everything is so great.

119
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,320
&quot;The drawer is mostly empty, except for...&quot;

120
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,600
Oh, thank God, &quot;A school
cross-country shirt with a tear in it.&quot;

121
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,800
I thought it would be something else....

122
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,100
Damn, I got a lot of trophies.

123
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:39,100
&quot;It's a computer desk. There are many boxes under it filled with old books.&quot;

124
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:43,100
Alright, let's just get moving.

125
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,500
Damn, I look good.

126
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,980
&quot;The door is-&quot; OK, great.

127
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:51,100
Damn, it feels great to be playing this.

128
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,240
What?... That was a bit glitchy or...

129
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,660
...like a mistake...

130
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:55,840
I'll let it slide, it's okay.

131
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,640
This has to be the... like...

132
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,840
&quot;It's the TV. Doesn't seem to even be plugged in anymore.&quot;

133
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,460
Alright go- oh, here we are

134
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:08,120
&quot;Kris! There you are, we might still be able to make it!&quot;

135
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:12,840
&quot;Kris.... It is a beautiful day today, is it not?&quot;

136
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,360
&quot;I hope it stays this way when Asriel visits next-&quot;

137
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,740
Wait! So it is Undertale!

138
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:22,460
&quot;But I wonder... after the excitement of University...&quot;

139
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:27,020
&quot;Will he sill enjoy coming home to this little town...?&quot;

140
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,020
Is it like a prequel or something?

141
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:33,560
Oh my God.

142
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,940
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. 
Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

143
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:43,100
Okay, &quot;librararby.&quot;

144
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46,300
This is great.

145
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:51,960
Oh my God, THE MUSIC!

146
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:59,700
I'm freakin' hyped man.

147
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,020
That's cute :)

148
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:04,320
Just don't hug me in school mom, Jesus Christ. :(

149
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:09,260
And why does she go to the right, and not down where we came?

150
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:13,920
(new accent) &quot;So does everyone have a...&quot;

151
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,540
&quot;Oh, Kris!&quot;

152
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:20,100
&quot;We thought you weren't coming today!&quot;

153
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,320
&quot;We're doing group projects this month...&quot;

154
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:27,220
&quot;Uh...So... walk around and find a partner, ok?&quot;

155
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:30,080
God, this was the worst, finding a partner in school.

156
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,560
That was only during class 7 and 8,
that I actually had a friend to partner with.

157
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,340
We were always like, OK we'll go,

158
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,300
and it was the best.

159
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,180
But if you don't have that?

160
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,140
It's the worst.

161
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:43,140
Now, obviously, I'm gonna partner with a snake.

162
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:47,880
(another accent) &quot;Kris! You know
Jockington and Catti, are always partners!&quot;

163
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,860
&quot;We're the ultimate academic duo-&quot; See, he's rubbing it in!

164
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,140
He's rubbing it in!

165
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:57,260
&quot;Ever since our first gym class! It was hula hoop day, and they ran out of hoops for us...&quot;

166
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:01,300
&quot;So she used me instead! That's our origin story!&quot;

167
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,880
Damnit! That is a great origin story!

168
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,380
What about this... thing?

169
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:10,160
(cowboy accent) &quot;Partn'er? I hardly know' er!!&quot;

170
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,220
&quot;Ha ha ha!! Whaddya think of that one!? Funny, right?&quot;

171
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,400
&quot;... No?&quot;

172
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:20,480
&quot;Well, I got news for you, pal! I already GOT a partner!! SCRAM!&quot;

173
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,000
Sheesh.

174
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,320
What about?...

175
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,820
&quot;Yo, Kris... show up earlier next time!&quot;

176
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:29,620
&quot;I ended up having to partner with Snowy, ha, haha...&quot;

177
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:34,400
&quot;Now he keeps turning to me and saying
'Howdy, Partner!' like a cowboy...&quot;

178
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,640
Jeez, what about....

179
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,700
Jesus!

180
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:41,100
(Sayori voice) &quot;KRISP!! awa... ver sorz... tem already have-&quot;

181
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:44,500
What the f-

182
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,560
Is that an egg?

183
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,920
&quot;(It's a black-and-white hardboiled egg.)&quot;

184
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:57,140
&quot;(Sadly, seems like it already has a partner.)&quot;

185
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,640
Why is this game doing me like this?

186
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,600
Alright, come on man-

187
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,600
&quot;Ah, Kris. Late again, I see.&quot;

188
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:08,760
&quot;Hmm? You need a partner? Sorry, I'm already partners with the 2nd smartest student.&quot;

189
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,520
Oh! So you're the smartest?

190
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,440
&quot;Though... wait!&quot;

191
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,780
&quot;Now that I think about it...&quot;

192
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:17,520
&quot;Your unique skillset might help a LOT on this assignment!&quot;

193
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,900
&quot;Pfft, NOT!&quot;

194
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,900
Jesus Christ!

195
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,580
THIS IS CYBER BULLYING!!

196
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,380
&quot;I actually want to get an A!&quot;

197
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:28,300
Jesus.

198
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:31,040
(Monika Voice) &quot;Hey, Kris! What's up? Didja lose your pencil again?&quot;

199
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,740
&quot;Here, you want the candy-cane one or the one with lights on it?&quot;

200
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,820
&quot;Huh? You want to be partners?&quot;

201
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:40,040
&quot;Ummm... sorry... Berdly already asked me...&quot;

202
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,960
&quot;But I could ask Ms. Alphys if
we could make a group of 3!&quot;

203
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,620
&quot;I'll ask if you're sure!&quot;

204
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,280
Uhh...

205
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,360
Ok, then... &quot;Ok, I'll ask!&quot;

206
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,720
&quot;Miss Alphys! Umm, is it OK if we have a group of 3?&quot;

207
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:57,240
Please. &quot;Hey! What? No!
I do NOT approve this! ABORT!!&quot;

208
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,780
&quot;What? B-but Kris doesn't have a...&quot;

209
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:04,300
(accent) &quot;Noelle, what were you saying?&quot;

210
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:07,260
&quot;She was just saying we're FINE being alone!&quot;

211
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,940
(Timidly) &quot;A-actually, I just wanted to know if...&quot;

212
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,300
*chuckles*

213
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:13,000
&quot;Noelle, can you PLEASE SPEAK UP?&quot;

214
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,760
Oh God....

215
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,640
&quot;Hi... S-Susie...&quot;

216
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:22,120
Susie!

217
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,700
(Mysterious) &quot;...Am I late?&quot;

218
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,820
&quot;Ohh, n-no! You're fine! W-we were jus, um...&quot;

219
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:30,820
&quot;Ch-Choosing partners for the next group project, and...&quot;

220
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,100
&quot;Ummm, Susie, you're wih Kris!&quot;

221
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,720
Oh great, fantastic!

222
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,860
At least I get a partner.

223
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:39,920
Oh man, I always got to partner with the weirdos in class...

224
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,140
But now I think about it, I was probably the weirdo.

225
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:46,060
&quot;...great.&quot;

226
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:48,320
*chuckles*

227
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:54,520
&quot;N-now that everyone's here, I'll write the assignment!&quot;

228
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,720
Is he just gonna stand there?

229
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,460
&quot;Uh... H-has anyone seen the chalk?&quot;

230
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:03,520
&quot;This is the third time it's gone mssing, and...&quot;

231
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,460
&quot;Y-you all know I can't start without some!&quot;

232
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:10,280
Oh, that's too bad, I guess we won't have class.

233
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,200
&quot;H-how about this? If no one speaks up...&quot;

234
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,140
&quot;E-everybody get's in trouble!&quot;

235
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,800
Yeah, that will do it! *chuckles*

236
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:24,420
&quot;A...any-?&quot; Did I just try to drink this with the lid on? &quot;P...Please?&quot;

237
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,580
&quot;Hey there might be a box in the supply closet...&quot;

238
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:30,060
&quot;Miss Alphys, why don't Susie and I...&quot;

239
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:33,800
&quot;G-good idea, Noelle! Susie, s-since you came in last...&quot;

240
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,740
&quot;Why don't you go get it for me...?&quot;

241
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:40,360
&quot;...whatever.&quot;

242
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,200
&quot;And K... Kris... Can you go with her and make sure she...&quot;

243
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,920
&quot;Um, actually gets it? and um, stay out of trouble...?&quot;

244
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,520
&quot;Thanks, Kris! See you later!&quot;

245
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,320
Fan-tastic.

246
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,400
What about you, then?

247
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,780
&quot;Click, click, tap, tap...&quot;

248
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:54,560
&quot;...don't die.&quot;

249
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,280
*laughs*

250
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,640
What do you say, then?

251
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:03,460
&quot;Kris if I had arms... I would take off this cool hat in rememberence of you.&quot;

252
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,340
God Damn

253
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:08,900
&quot;Kris, Kris, don't listen to 'em. It's not that bad&quot;

254
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:12,000
&quot;You'll PROBABLY survive Susie beating you up.&quot;

255
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,760
&quot;You're just gonna fail when she doesn't do ANY of your project!!&quot;

256
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:19,680
&quot;It's like was always say, Kris... You SUZ, you LOSE!!!

257
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,920
(Gasp) You Laugh You Lose, You Suz You Lose?

258
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,840
&quot;...uhhh, that's not very reassuring, huh.&quot;

259
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,900
&quot;Yo! Kris! I'm sorry! If I had just waited to be your partner...&quot;

260
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:33,940
&quot;You wouldn't have to be HERS!&quot; She's probably gonna pound you to pieces, Kris!

261
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:37,700
&quot;And then kick the butts of all those little pieces!&quot;

262
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:42,000
What does egg have to say about this?

263
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,520
*laughs*

264
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,520
I love the humor in these games

265
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:52,660
So silly

266
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:55,320
Did he just eat the chalk?

267
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,040
Oh God

268
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,140
Uhh... &quot;Kris.&quot;

269
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:03,560
&quot;Didn't see you there.&quot;

270
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,060
&quot;Hey.&quot;

271
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:10,360
&quot;You didn't see anything just now, did you?&quot;

272
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:14,420
(sudden constipation)

273
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:17,200
&quot;You can't even say?&quot;

274
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,900
I don't know... I can't really... I'm not really getting any options here, man...

275
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:24,180
&quot;Kris...&quot;

276
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:24,840
Oh God

277
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,460
It's over

278
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,580
Oh God

279
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,880
&quot;Hey&quot;

280
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,480
Oh God

281
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,400
Please don't hurt me

282
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,240
&quot;Let me tell you a secret.&quot;

283
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,040
You like eating-

284
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,820
Oh God.

285
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:39,420
(Laughs)

286
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:44,680
&quot;Quiet people piss me off.&quot;

287
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,240
&quot;You think just 'cause you don't say anything...

288
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,180
&quot;...I can't tell EXACTLY what you're thinking?&quot;

289
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:53,720
&quot;It's OVER! I caught Susie eating all the chalk!&quot;

290
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,660
&quot;This was her LAST chance! Now she'll finally be expelled!&quot;

291
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:01,400
&quot;Haha... come on Kris. Don't act shocked. You know it's true.&quot;

292
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,380
&quot;Everyone's waiting for it. Everyone wants it.&quot;

293
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:09,660
&quot;So, congrats, Kris. You got me. I'm done for.&quot;

294
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:12,660
&quot;Just, lemme say one little thing.&quot;

295
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:15,760
&quot;Seems like a waste to get expelled just for having a snack.

296
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,700
&quot;So, Kris, if I KNOW you're gonna pull the trigger...&quot;

297
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,440
&quot;Heh heh heh...&quot;

298
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,080
&quot;Why don't I just get expelled for some REAL carnage?&quot;

299
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,800
&quot;Kris... How do you feel...&quot;

300
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,260
Oh God.

301
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:32,040
&quot;About losing your face?&quot;

302
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:39,580
I feel strongly against it. Strongly against it. STRONGLY AGAINST IIIIT!!

303
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,080
&quot;Nah.&quot;

304
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:44,040
*chuckles*

305
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,440
&quot;Kris... You've got a good mother.&quot;

306
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,580
&quot;...it'd be a shame to make her bury her child.&quot;

307
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,620
&quot;Alright. Let's get this over with.&quot;

308
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:56,820
&quot;We'll get more chalk. Mosey back to class. And then, Kris...

309
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:00,280
&quot;YOU'LL do our project. How's that sound?&quot;

310
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:00,780
Uh-

311
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,680
&quot;Don't bother answering.&quot;

312
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,080
&quot;If you haven't gotten it by now...&quot;

313
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,380
&quot;Your choices don't matter.&quot;

314
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,860
Hey, I don't like the way if you don't talk

315
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,420
By the way, don't talk.

316
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,620
&quot;Let's go, freak.&quot;

317
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:16,380
Jesus Christ, I almost died out there.

318
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,940
Oh God, he's looking at me.

319
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:21,040
What happens if I just leave?

320
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,740
&quot;Kris...? You just gonna skip school...?

321
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:26,960
&quot;What, am I supposed to snitch on YOU? That'd be rich, huh?&quot;

322
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,460
&quot;Nah, I wouldn't. Get back here.&quot;

323
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:33,980
&quot;Kris, if you skip school, your mom'll have a heart attack.&quot;

324
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,500
&quot;Kris, if-&quot; Ok

325
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:39,400
Alright, alright, fine, I won't give my mom a heart attack.

326
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,460
&quot;God, can you walk any slower, or what?&quot;

327
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,420
&quot;Nah, I get it.

328
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:48,040
Not used to walking around without someone holding your hand?

329
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,760
&quot;Come on, freak.&quot;

330
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:55,580
Jeez, sheesh...

331
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:59,720
Well, here's the closet. Too bad...

332
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:04,020
&quot;We were just starting to have fun.&quot;

333
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:07,720
That's a very ominous closet... I must say...

334
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,120
Oh

335
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:17,440
&quot;Hey, Kris, is it me, or... is it REALLY dark in there?&quot;

336
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:23,700
&quot;What's the holdup, Kris? Are you gonna go in or what?&quot;

337
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:29,940
&quot;Fine! If you're gonna be a WIMP, then I'll...&quot;

338
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:34,060
&quot;We'll go-&quot; *laughs* &quot;We'll both go in at the same time!!&quot;

339
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:37,320
Seems fair.

340
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,200
&quot;See? Why are you so scared?&quot;

341
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,480
&quot;There's nothing in here but old papers.&quot;

342
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,800
&quot;Let's try to find a lightswitch.&quot;

343
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,060
&quot;Kris, if you leave me here, I'll...&quot; Ok, alright.

344
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:49,060
Ok, ok, I'm here, ok, what's up?

345
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:51,640
&quot;That's weird... I can't find a switch.&quot;

346
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:57,000
&quot;Guess it's further in...&quot; Oh God, no, God, ah, ah, God

347
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,540
&quot;Uhhh... kind of big for a closet, huh...?&quot;

348
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:06,480
&quot;You'd think we'd have reached the end by now...&quot;

349
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,400
&quot;Hey, Kris. I think this closet's, uh... broken.&quot;

350
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,740
&quot;There aren't any walls.&quot;

351
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,640
&quot;Well, we've worked hard enough.&quot;

352
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,500
&quot;If Alphys wants chalk so bad, she can get it herself.&quot;

353
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:24,160
&quot;Let's split.&quot;

354
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,720
We did it, guys.

355
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,740
Ah, shi- *instant regret*

356
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:29,680
Damnit!

357
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,860
&quot;What the...!?

358
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:39,440
&quot;Hey, this isn't funny! LET US OUT! LET US...&quot;

359
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,960
&quot;The floor, it's...!

360
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,440
*shookth*

361
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,740
That's DOOOPE!

362
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:51,900
We're falling down!

363
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:57,940
It's all happening again!

364
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:05,560
Are we gonna meet some monsters?

365
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,080
Damn, I look...

366
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:14,480
Is that an armor? What is that? I look cool. Look at that!

367
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,220
(High-pitched voice) Save Station! Battle up.

368
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:20,780
&quot;At times you see it flickering. The light only you can see.&quot;

369
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:24,120
&quot;By second nature, you reach out, and...&quot; save it.

370
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:27,380
Heck yeah, guys. Look, we're doing great.

371
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,220
So proud.

372
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:33,280
Ok, well this is very ominous. Ah, jeez.

373
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:38,600
Alien nipple. It's waving at me. 'Hello, alien nipple'

374
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:43,120
Good to see you, alien nipple.

375
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,600
It looks like a... looks like a face.

376
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,700
O-kay, it is a face.

377
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,980
Wait... I saw something moving up there!

378
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:54,540
You see it?

379
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:57,800
Ahh! Ok, I'm fine.

380
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:02,260
Cool, this... Oh that's definitely a face!

381
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:06,500
What is happening here?

382
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,660
&quot;There's something glowing inside. Take it?&quot;

383
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,820
&quot;You got the Glowshard.&quot;

384
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:14,460
What in the world is a Glows-hard?

385
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,660
*snickers*

386
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:19,820
GOOD NAME!

387
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,300
Ah, jeez. Okay...

388
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,320
Not on my watch, alien nipples.

389
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,780
I don't think so!

390
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,500
Save Sta- &quot;You bathed your body in the light.&quot;

391
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,460
&quot;A power shines within you, breaking through the darkness.&quot;

392
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:36,980
&quot;Any pain you may have had melted away...&quot; I have HP fully restored

393
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,200
Ok, doing well.

394
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:42,940
&quot;In this land, only eyes blinded by darkness can see the way...&quot;

395
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:49,540
What is this, a puzzle?

396
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:55,940
Wow! I must be some kind of genius. Incredible.

397
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:56,920
Ew...

398
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:00,580
Do I get anything for activating thaaat?

399
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,400
EWW!

400
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,600
EWW!

401
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,980
Ay!

402
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:07,440
You saw that.

403
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,100
Oh! Again

404
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,080
Eh-

405
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,180
&quot;Hey! Back off! Come any closer and I'll...!!&quot;

406
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,280
*chuckles*

407
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:20,560
&quot;K- Kris... Phew! Hey, don't scare me like that, dumbass!&quot;

408
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,920
&quot;Unless you WANT to get clocked in the face, heh.&quot;

409
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:29,460
&quot;Anyway, enough screwing around. We gotta find a way outta here.&quot;

410
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:33,220
&quot;Ummm... where is 'here' anyway?&quot; *laughs*

411
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:37,840
&quot;It doesn't matter! YOU got us into this mess, YOU get us out!&quot;

412
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,520
(In surprise) How did I do it? I didn't do anything!

413
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,420
&quot;Lead the way, Kris!&quot;

414
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:46,040
Look, who's the scaredy-cat, huh?

415
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:50,720
&quot;Oh my God. Nevermind. You walk WAY too slow&quot; *chuckles* Jesus...

416
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,440
Alright, okay.

417
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:57,840
Where'd he go?

418
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,780
Who's this?

419
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:03,840
&quot;Hey, Kris. There's someone up there waving at us.&quot;

420
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,460
&quot;Any idea what they want...?&quot;

421
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:10,480
Sans! It's Sans! Whoa!

422
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,960
(High-pitched voice) Sa- &quot;R-run Kris!&quot;

423
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,280
Ah God!

424
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,360
Ah, ah

425
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,020
Ah

426
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:22,760
It's okay. I played Undertale 2... I mean 1.

427
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:26,540
I know how to do this. I'm an expert!

428
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:30,040
I'm channeling all my epic gamer skills.

429
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:33,700
This is a ZERO DEATH run, everyone. I will die-

430
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,480
Oh, God, that was actually close.

431
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,040
OHHH!

432
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,420
PROOO!

433
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,660
*high-pitched voice* Prooo!

434
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:42,000
Made it! &quot;Kris, down here!&quot;

435
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,320
Ok!

436
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,360
Ay! Whoa!

437
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,840
Sheesh!

438
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,440
Ay!

439
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,420
(Anime voice) Stop it!

440
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,600
Everyone!

441
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,720
EVERYONE!

442
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,540
I have an announcent!

443
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,040
Stop!

444
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:03,860
Look at that (shoo shoo)

445
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,900
What a waterslide.

446
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:09,300
Damn, I love the art...

447
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:12,340
It's so simple and still so effective.

448
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:14,400
&quot;Oh, you're not dead. Sweet.&quot;

449
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,600
&quot;Got an idea what the heck this place is?&quot;

450
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,760
&quot;...me neither.&quot;

451
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:23,820
&quot;Wonder if there's anyone in that building up there...?&quot;

452
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,560
(High-pitched voice) Save Station.

453
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:28,460
&quot;In front of you, a castle looms beneath the empty town.&quot;

454
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:31,900
&quot;A black geyser- (Pffts with burp) emerges from it...&quot;

455
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:34,240
&quot;...piercing endlessly into the sky.&quot;

456
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,900
&quot;The power of this place shines within you.&quot;

457
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,740
Eye Puzzle...

458
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:46,480
What is this?

459
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,260
&quot;A castle...?&quot;

460
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:53,560
&quot;Why the hell is there a castle inside a supply closet...?&quot;

461
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,880
&quot;Welcome, heroes...!&quot;

462
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,160
&quot;Who's there!?&quot;

463
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:01,420
&quot;Do not be alarmed... I am not your enemy.&quot;

464
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:05,800
&quot;Please come forward, both of you...&quot;

465
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:09,400
Oh. It's Sans! It's gotta be Sans.&quot;

466
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:14,240
&quot;Welcome. I am the Prince of this Kingdom... The KINGDOM OF DARKNESS!&quot;

467
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:14,740
*laughs*

468
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:17,900
&quot;Kris, Susie... There is a LEGEND in this land.&quot;

469
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:22,320
&quot;A LEGEND that one day, two HEROES of LIGHT will arrive,&quot;

470
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:27,320
&quot;And fulfill the ancient prophecy, foretold by time and space.&quot;

471
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:32,200
&quot;Please, Heroes... Listen to my tale...&quot;

472
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,220
&quot;Very well, then...&quot;

473
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,180
Alright.

474
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,920
Let's listen to that...

475
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:44,760
&quot;Once upon a time, a LEGEND was whispered among shadows.&quot;

476
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:48,900
&quot;It was a LEGEND of HOPE. It was a LEGEND of DREAMS.&quot;

477
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:52,800
&quot;It was a LEGEND of LIGHT. It was a LEGEND of DARK.&quot;

478
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:58,100
&quot;This is the legend of DELTA RUNE.&quot; Deltarune!

479
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,960
My God...

480
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,800
&quot;For millenia, LIGHT and DARK have lived in balance,&quot;

481
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,460
&quot;Bringing peace to the-&quot; This is very Zelda.

482
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,040
&quot;Bringing peace to the WORLD.&quot;

483
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:14,340
&quot;But if this harmony were to shatter...&quot;

484
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:19,060
&quot;A terrible calamity would occur.&quot;

485
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:23,560
&quot;The sky will run black with terror...&quot;

486
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,900
&quot;And the land will crack with fear.&quot;

487
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,960
That sounds like a bad time.

488
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,900
&quot;Then, her heart pounding...&quot;

489
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:37,420
&quot;The EARTH will draw her final breath.&quot;

490
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:41,880
&quot;Only then, shining with hope...&quot;

491
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:46,500
&quot;Three HEROES appear at WORLDS' edge&quot;

492
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:53,720
&quot;A HUMAN, a MONSTER and a PRINCE FROM THE DARK.&quot;

493
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,260
Wow.

494
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,520
That fits our description perfectly.

495
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:00,060
&quot;Only they can seal the fountains.&quot; The fountains...

496
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:03,540
The geyser?

497
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,500
&quot;And banish the Angel's wrath.&quot;

498
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:09,600
&quot;Only then will balance be restored,&quot;

499
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:14,160
&quot;And the WORLD saved from destruction.&quot;

500
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:18,660
&quot;Today, The FOUNTAIN OF DARKNESS-&quot;

501
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:23,420
&quot;The GEYSER that gives this land form-&quot;

502
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:29,700
&quot;Stands tall at the center of the kingdom.&quot;

503
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,160
That's kinda weird...

504
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:34,700
&quot;But recently, another fountain has appeared on the horizon...&quot;

505
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,100
And it's bigger than ours, I don't like it.

506
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:42,980
&quot;And with it, the balance of LIGHT and DARK begins to shift...&quot;

507
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:45,480
This is... this is interesting...

508
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,940
I'm curious, tell me more, Prince Of Darkness.

509
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:52,380
&quot;Kris, Susie... Thank you for listening to my long tale.&quot;

510
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:55,000
It was very long, I'm glad you added that.

511
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,800
&quot;I deeply believe you two are the HEROES of the LEGEND.&quot;

512
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:02,720
&quot;That despite whatever enemies you may face...&quot;

513
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,960
&quot;You two have the COURAGE to SAVE THE WORLD.&quot;

514
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,540
&quot;DELTA WARRIORS!&quot;

515
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:13,180
&quot;Please, won't you accept your destiny...?&quot;

516
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:16,700
&quot;Uhhh... Nah.&quot; *chuckles* Jesus Christ...

517
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,820
&quot;W...what?&quot;

518
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:22,560
&quot;Me? Some kind of hero or something...?&quot;

519
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,660
&quot;You've got the wrong person.&quot;

520
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:29,240
&quot;B-but Susie, without you, the... the world will...&quot;

521
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:33,780
&quot;So what? If the world gets destroyed... It's none of my damn business.&quot;

522
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:37,260
&quot;Might even be kind of fun, honestly.&quot;

523
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,320
&quot;Anyway, Kris...&quot;

524
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,420
&quot;If YOU wanna play pretend with this weirdo... &quot;

525
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,640
&quot;Stick around.&quot;

526
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,160
&quot;I'M going to find a way out of here.&quot;

527
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:49,740
&quot;Sus-susie... Wait!&quot;

528
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,500
What?

529
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,140
It's SANS!! *chuckles*

530
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:57,660
&quot;Ho ho ho! The heroes are already running away...&quot;

531
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:00,780
&quot;And they didn't even know I was here.&quot;

532
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:05,640
&quot;My dad's gonna make me Son of the Month!&quot; *laughs*

533
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:09,120
How many sons does he have? Lemme guess. One.

534
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,800
&quot;Who the hell are you!?&quot;

535
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,180
&quot;I'm...!&quot;

536
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:17,240
&quot;THE BAD GUY! *laughs*

537
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:20,800
&quot;You CLOWNS want to seal our DARK FOUNTAIN, huh!?&quot;

538
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:25,040
&quot;And - STILL picturing you guys as CLOWNS -&quot;

539
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:28,120
&quot;Save the world from ETERNAL DARKNESS, huh!?&quot;

540
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,940
&quot;Eh.&quot;

541
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,520
&quot;Don't try to deny it...!&quot;

542
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,420
&quot;We both know you'll go EAST!&quot;

543
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,600
&quot;It's your only way home!&quot;

544
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,240
&quot;But, I, LANCER,&quot; Lancer... *snickers*

545
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,140
&quot;won't let you go there!&quot;

546
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:44,420
&quot;And I've got a flawless two step plan to ensure it.&quot;

547
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:46,840
&quot;Step one. I thrash you.&quot;

548
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,460
&quot;Step two. You lose!&quot;

549
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,480
You Thrash You Lose!

550
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,320
&quot;Hmm. Nice plan, kid.&quot;

551
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,460
&quot;R-really...?&quot;

552
00:27:55,460 --> 00:28:00,380
&quot;Yeah, actually... Mind if we use it on you instead?&quot;

553
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,400
Oh!

554
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,380
Oh!

555
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:05,020
It's fighting time.

556
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:07,840
Uhh, Kris can act.

557
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,680
Uh, warning.

558
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:12,820
&quot;You tell Lancer to watch out for Susie's attack.&quot;

559
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:15,880
&quot;He redies himself.&quot;

560
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,480
(facepalm)

561
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:21,500
&quot;Halt, clowns! This bike is fueled by victory!!!&quot;

562
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,540
Oh God.

563
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:25,380
Ooh-

564
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,900
&quot;Dunno how I got an axe, but, like, that's cool.&quot; *laughs*

565
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:31,200
Oh yeah!

566
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,040
Almost.

567
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:38,960
&quot;I love to get thrashed... just kidding-!&quot; Oh. God.

568
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,820
Hey!

569
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:48,780
&quot;Lancer's riding it out.&quot;

570
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:50,080
Did we get him?

571
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:55,420
&quot;So what are you guys doing after this???&quot;

572
00:28:55,420 --> 00:29:01,960
No plans, just going home.

573
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,600
&quot;Hohoho!!! I'm the bad guy!&quot;

574
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,760
Yeah, we- oh!

575
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,900
What happens if I go close?

576
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:11,280
It like, charges. Okay.

577
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:14,800
&quot;My bike's running out of fuel...! Alright, you punk-a-roos!&quot;

578
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:18,860
&quot;You had the luck of the draw this time, but... next time, the losers will be YOU!!&quot;

579
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,880
&quot;Hahaha!!! Bye, losers!!&quot;

580
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,940
&quot;I gotta get home befor dinner!!!&quot;

581
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:28,640
&quot;You won! Got 0 XP.&quot;

582
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,560
&quot;Are you two O..?&quot;

583
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:34,400
&quot;Um, allow me to introduce myself more properly, I am...&quot;

584
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:38,100
&quot;Jeez, can you take off that hood? I can barely hear you under there.&quot;

585
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:41,040
&quot;U-ummm, alright...&quot;

586
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,600
What the- what?

587
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,140
&quot;Hello everyone. I'm Ralsei.&quot;

588
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:49,900
&quot;Kris, Susie... It's ever so wonderful to meet you!&quot;

589
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:54,380
&quot;I'm certain we're going to become great friends, and,&quot;

590
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:56,640
&quot;Best way to leave is East, right?&quot;

591
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,260
&quot;Yes! That's where we'll...&quot;

592
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:02,220
&quot;Got it.&quot;

593
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:04,260
&quot;See you at school, Kris.&quot;

594
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,380
PFFT *grins*

595
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:11,500
&quot;Umm... I suppose it's just the two of us, then...&quot;

596
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,100
This is so sad.

597
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:16,240
&quot;Kris, I am-&quot; Are you the Prince of Darkness?

598
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,040
&quot;I am a PRINCE, but...&quot;

599
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:21,040
&quot;I, um, currently don't have any subjects.&quot;

600
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,340
&quot;I've been waiting alone here...&quot;

601
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:26,380
&quot;Um... my whole life for you two to arrive.&quot;

602
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:29,040
&quot;So... I'm really happy to meet you.&quot;

603
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:32,500
I hope we can be good friends, Kris.&quot;

604
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:38,840
Uhh... &quot;Let's try to find Susie. She must be to the southeast.&quot;

605
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:42,200
&quot;You can lead the way, Kris!&quot;

606
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:46,740
Let's go.

607
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:49,080
Oh, let's do a save.

608
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:52,020
&quot;Ralsei, the lonely prince, is now your ally.&quot;

609
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:55,400
The power of fluffy boys shines within you.

610
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,180
Damn!

611
00:30:56,180 --> 00:31:02,160
That's one of the strongest powers, this world has ever known.

612
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:07,420
Let's keep going. Why not? I'll make this an extra long episode.

613
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:08,120
What is this?

614
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:11,200
&quot;Oh, Kris! It's the training dummy I made!&quot;

615
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,160
&quot;Now seems like a great chance to prepare for the enemy.&quot;

616
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,540
&quot;Would you like me to teach you how to fight?&quot;

617
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,520
I guess?

618
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:21,640
&quot;Ok! Get ready, Kris!&quot;

619
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,140
&quot;See that HEART, Kris?&quot;

620
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:26,060
&quot;That's your SOUL, the culmination of your being!&quot;

621
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:28,760
&quot;Within, it holds your WILL... your COMPASSION...&quot;

622
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,380
&quot;And the FATE of the world.&quot;

623
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,100
So, yeah... uh,

624
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,520
You probably know Undertale.

625
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,180
You could choose if you wanted to play passive...

626
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,700
or aggressive, I guess...

627
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,400
That's a really bad way to explain it.

628
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:42,120
&quot;If it gets hit, you and your friend will lose health.&quot;

629
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:45,020
&quot;If everyone's HP reaches 0-&quot; Ok, obvious.

630
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:48,200
&quot;So please take care to avoid the enemy's attack.&quot;

631
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:51,840
&quot;Ready? Let's try-&quot; Okay.

632
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:55,300
See, it charges if I go close-

633
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:58,740
&quot;You're a natural! Anyhow, after the enemy attacks, it's our turn.&quot;

634
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:04,420
&quot;First, I'll teach you how to fight.&quot;

635
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:09,060
Ok, let's try fighting.

636
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:11,380
&quot;Wow, Kris! That was an amazing attack!&quot;

637
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:16,520
&quot;Have you done this before or something...? OK, next let's try DEFENDING.&quot;

638
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:19,100
Oh yeah, I have defending.

639
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:30,240
Oh, I gather TP if I defend...

640
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:36,000
And now we have to spend that TP on spells.

641
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,820
&quot;Now, If I use my PACIFY spell on it... it'll fall asleep.&quot;

642
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:45,900
Oh, so you can play pacify.

643
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:54,260
Pacify.

644
00:32:54,260 --> 00:33:03,060
&quot;Acting! Through this, even the most violent enemies can be defeated through the various acts of kindness!&quot;

645
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:08,220
If its- even though it's a dummy, give it a hug

646
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:15,440
I can hug Ralsie, that's cute. Hug.

647
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,760
WHAT IS THIS, SO WEIRD!

648
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,460
&quot;Aww, that's great, Kris!&quot;

649
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:23,640
&quot;Each enemy has different ACTs that satisfy them.&quot;

650
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,800
&quot;When an enemy is satisfied, its name turns YELLOW.&quot;

651
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,540
&quot;When that happens, you can defeat it by sparing it!&quot;

652
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:39,740
&quot;If we SPARE all the enemies we meet, we'll never have to FIGHT!&quot;

653
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:47,060
Man, what should I do? Should I spare or should I fight?

654
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:50,140
&quot;Oh, that was fun! You're a wonderful student, Kris!&quot;

655
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:52,440
&quot;...and, er, in case you ever need a refresher...&quot;

656
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,720
&quot;Here! I wrote a Manual for you and Susie!&quot;

657
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,140
&quot;Press [C] to open the menu and use it for your- in your ITEMS.&quot;

658
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:04,840
You got the manual.

659
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:11,500
&quot;You tried to read the manual, but it was so dense it made your head spin...&quot;

660
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:14,940
Great.

661
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:16,260
This is so-

662
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:18,540
&quot;Oh my! The Great Door is opened?!&quot;

663
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:21,540
&quot;No wonder Lancer was able to come through...&quot;

664
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:23,760
&quot;Kris, once we pass through this door...&quot;

665
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,860
&quot;Our adventure will really begin.&quot;

666
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:29,460
&quot;A journey foretold exactly by the prophecy...&quot;

667
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:32,940
&quot;But, Kris, I believe YOUR choices are important, too.&quot;

668
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:35,480
&quot;This world is full of all kinds of people, Kris.&quot;

669
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:38,300
&quot;In the end, how we treat them makes all the difference.&quot;

670
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:42,300
&quot;So let's try our best to get by without FIGHTing.&quot;

671
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:46,780
&quot;If we can manage to do that... I believe this tale may have a happy ending.&quot;

672
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:51,040
&quot;Otherwise, I fear that... you may not find the result favorable.&quot;

673
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,040
&quot;Oh, I'm sorry! Is that too much to ask?&quot;

674
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,300
I can handle it.

675
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,820
&quot;Kris, I knew you were a hero the moment I saw you.&quot;

676
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:00,640
&quot;Let's try our best, alright?&quot;

677
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,060
Okay.

678
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:05,940
So, the game is kinda telling us that we should try and spare them, it seems like...

679
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:08,280
At least, that's what I can gather from this.

680
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,760
And I remember in Undertale,

681
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,600
the pacifist was way more fun,

682
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,020
cuz they had like, jokes built into them.

683
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,780
Instead of just killing them.

684
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,240
Uhh...

685
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:21,940
So, I think we'll play that... right?...

686
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:27,060
We'll get to- I wanna play a little bit. it's so pretty. Look at the cherry blossoms. *chuckles*

687
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,780
In this video game...

688
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:29,960
Ooh!

689
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,440
Ok!

690
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,220
&quot;Enemies ahead! You're gonna die! Signed, Lancer&quot;

691
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:38,420
Let's play a little bit more.

692
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:39,940
Oh God.

693
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:42,940
Ok, so we have to Pacify it.

694
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,060
&quot;Rudinn drew near!&quot;

695
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:48,020
Ok, so what we do is, we defend.

696
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,440
Defend.

697
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,740
&quot;Face my Diamond Cutter!!&quot;

698
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:53,600
Oh God.

699
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:56,960
So, it charges your TP clearly if you go closer to it.

700
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,240
&quot;Rudinn is glimmering plainly.&quot;

701
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,160
Let's defend... and, defend.

702
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,220
&quot;Face my Diamond Cutter!!&quot;

703
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:10,580
Okay, I- we gotcha.

704
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:12,140
&quot;Smells like jewelry.&quot;

705
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:15,140
Now let's... act.

706
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:21,640
Uhh... convince.

707
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:27,220
Does that work?

708
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,160
Kris...

709
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,680
Wait... sorry, I messed up.

710
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,520
Kris wants to...

711
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,540
Convince.

712
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:34,740
And he will defend.

713
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:38,600
&quot;You told Rudinn to quit fighting. It was utterly swayed.&quot;

714
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,060
&quot;Yeah I guess that makes sense.&quot;

715
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:41,180
*laughs*

716
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,300
Yeah, see what I mean?

717
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,020
Oh, that's great.

718
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:46,200
It's just more fun.

719
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,520
So, now we get to spare.

720
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:52,580
&quot;Rudinn dislikes its boss, but doesn't care enough to quit.&quot;

721
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:54,460
So, we spare.

722
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:55,660
&quot;Kris spared Rudinn!&quot;

723
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:57,200
&quot;You won!&quot;

724
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,040
Oh, that's great. Ok, cool.

725
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,160
So, it's fairly simple.

726
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:06,420
&quot;If you're reading this... I guess you're dead. Signed, Lancer.&quot;

727
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:07,740
*thinks deeply about it for a second*

728
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:12,560
Yes, of course, yes!

729
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,320
There he is, alright, what does it say?

730
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,660
&quot;Hey, don't read this sign! It's work in progress!&quot;

731
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:18,260
Sorry, I won't read it.

732
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:19,460
&quot;Ho ho ho...&quot;

733
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:21,520
&quot;If it isn't my two favorite people.&quot;

734
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:25,040
&quot;Psyche! You guys aren't even in my top five!!&quot;

735
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,120
&quot;Lancer! Where's Susie?&quot;

736
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,060
&quot;You mean the purple girl...? Ho ho ho...&quot;

737
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:29,780
*chuckles*

738
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:33,280
&quot;You fools! You're too late to stop me...!&quot;

739
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,540
&quot;What did you do?&quot;

740
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:36,720
&quot;Hahaha... it was SO simple!&quot;

741
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,000
&quot;She beat me up-&quot; *laughs*

742
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,840
&quot; &quot;so I ran away...!&quot;

743
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:44,160
&quot;That's a bit anticlimatic...&quot;

744
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,260
&quot;So, are you just going to stand there?&quot;

745
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:49,160
&quot;I thought you would at least run to the right...&quot;

746
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:52,860
&quot;Why!? The purple girl's over there!&quot; *laughs*

747
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:55,240
Ahh...

748
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:59,140
&quot;These types of trees DON'T contain an item that can heal you.&quot;

749
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:05,940
&quot;Whatever you do, DON'T check the tree and use [C] to open your menu! You got it!? Signed, Lancer.&quot;

750
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:08,840
&quot;There are two objects hanging from the tree. Take one?&quot;

751
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,360
Yes.

752
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:13,620
Dark Candy.

753
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:17,160
Okay.

754
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,460
Should we just...

755
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:23,160
&quot;Hey, if you head that way, my troops will thrash you.&quot;

756
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,660
&quot;Is that a threat?&quot;

757
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:27,580
&quot;I prefer to think of it as an invitation.&quot;

758
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:29,280
This game is great.

759
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,660
I love it.

760
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:34,120
&quot;A necklace of Rudinns blocks your path.&quot;

761
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:37,320
Ok, so we'll defend and defend.

762
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,520
&quot;Long live the guy that-&quot; *chuckles* &quot;who pays us!&quot;

763
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,640
&quot;Shine, shine&quot;

764
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:45,620
I'm tryna get close.

765
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:49,600
&quot;Rudinn thinks about elaborate stones.&quot;

766
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,440
I can relate.

767
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:56,240
&quot;I'm just a normal person.&quot;

768
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,660
Oh.

769
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:14,920
&quot;Rudinn dislikes its boss, but doesn't care enough to quit.&quot; So, let's...

770
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:19,160
&quot;You told Rudinn to quit fighting. It was utterly swayed.&quot;

771
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,780
&quot;But the enemy wasn't tired...&quot;

772
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:23,400
Oh, oh yeah, Pacify only works if it's tired.

773
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:29,180
So, there's different ways to go about it, okay.

774
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:30,780
So...

775
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:32,940
We can spare...

776
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:35,860
Rudinn.

777
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:38,980
And, let's try to defend one more time.

778
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:41,180
I forgot what I need to do... do I need to convince again?

779
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:44,540
Oh, right. We need to convince again. I'm stupid. Sorry guys.

780
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:47,240
I messed up.

781
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:50,980
Ok, so act and convince. There you go.

782
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:55,840
It doesn't care enough to quit.

783
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,300
Spare.

784
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,920
&quot;You told Rudinn to quit fighting. It was utterly swayed.&quot;

785
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,780
Ok, there we go.

786
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:05,780
Oh, it was swayed after I did it, that's what happened.

787
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,660
What is this?

788
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:11,540
(Italian accent) &quot;Mama miba! I'm TOPCHEF!&quot;

789
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:15,440
&quot;My latest cake worked me to exhaustion!&quot;

790
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:19,280
&quot;So I took a little nap... But, Mama miba!

791
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,560
&quot;A scary noise woke me up!&quot;

792
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:26,240
&quot;A beast was hunched on the table, eating the cake like an animal!&quot;

793
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:30,320
&quot;I spritzed it with water, and it hissed and ran off!

794
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:33,200
But, my wonderful cake is...&quot;

795
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:37,220
&quot;Aww, Kris, that sounds like Susie! We must be going the right way!&quot;

796
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:40,100
&quot;Let's try to keep her out of any more trouble!&quot;

797
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:49,400
&quot;M-m-mama miba! M-m-mama SHIBA! You know the beast!? You- Please don't come back...&quot;

798
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,420
&quot;The remains of the cake are still smouldering. Take a-&quot;

799
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:52,940
Uh, sure.

800
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:54,300
Broken cake.

801
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:55,260
Alright.

802
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:57,500
Why is it burning?

803
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,900
Mama shiba!

804
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:01,120
Ah God.

805
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,540
I like the fighting system, it's fun.

806
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:05,640
&quot;Rudinn and Hathy blocked the way.&quot;

807
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,580
Defend.

808
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:11,920
Let me know if I'm doing it right, cuz I don't know...

809
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,140
If I'm doing it...

810
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:25,840
&quot;Hathy's body beats audibly.&quot;

811
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:32,360
Ok, convince.

812
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:39,000
It worked...

813
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,180
I'm cu- I don't understand...

814
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:47,040
We can spare that one, and then we can...

815
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:53,860
But, it's not tired, so let's just defend then.

816
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:55,920
Oh God.

817
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,560
&quot;Smells like a soft kiss.&quot;

818
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:09,420
What does that smell like?

819
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:15,340
Ok, now we can...

820
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:19,360
Now we can spare.

821
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,780
Cute.

822
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:22,780
Ok, that's cool.

823
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:24,900
&quot;You won!&quot;

824
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:30,300
Fantastic.

825
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:44,740
&quot;Check the clock. In order to solve this puzzle, you'll have to hurry.&quot;

826
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:49,820
Wow.

827
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:51,680
Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta.

828
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,060
&quot;Prepare to GET LOST, clowns!!!

829
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:56,020
&quot;Behold, the Maze of Death!&quot;

830
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:59,140
&quot;Prepare to GET LOST, clowns!!! Signed, Lancer&quot;

831
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:01,140
I think I'll end that episode there.

832
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:02,760
I almost- I don't know...

833
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:05,140
I wanna play more, it's so good.

834
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:06,820
How could I not?

835
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:11,300
&quot;Feeling lost yet!? You must be UTTERLY HELPLESS among these twists and turns!&quot;

836
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:13,180
&quot;Your sense of direction won't save you now!&quot;

837
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:14,860
&quot;Signed, Lancer.&quot;

838
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:19,820
&quot;It's some sort of enemy... looks like they got globber- clobbered???&quot;

839
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:21,020
What does that mean? (Badly defeated.)

840
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:27,280
&quot;Hey, wait!! Where am I!? Help? Somebody help! I'm lost!! Signed, Lancer.&quot; *chuckles*

841
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,180
He- I love it.

842
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:31,460
&quot;You opened the treasure chest. Inside the White Ribbon.&quot;

843
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:33,740
&quot;You put White Ribbon in your ARMORs&quot;

844
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:36,760
&quot;That ribbon is ARMOR, Kris! It increases defense.&quot;

845
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:39,200
&quot;Why don't you try wearing it in the EQUIPMENT menu?&quot;

846
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,100
&quot;I think it'd look great on you!&quot;

847
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:42,580
Wow.

848
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:50,580
What a supporter.

849
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:54,400
Was this it?

850
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,660
How do I look?

851
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:58,280
That's cool that they added that.

852
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:03,460
&quot;Hey, don't look! This sign's private!&quot; Ok, sorry.

853
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:07,920
&quot;Oh, it's just this way. Signed, Lancer.&quot; *laughs*

854
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:11,100
&quot;Ho ho ho! Somehow you survived the maze!&quot;

855
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:14,440
&quot;But don't count your blessings before they hatch...!&quot;

856
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:18,380
&quot;Let's see how you fare against THIS team!&quot;

857
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:19,440
Oh God.

858
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,840
Three of them.

859
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:22,800
Ok, we'll defend.

860
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:28,880
And defend.

861
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,420
Look at that!

862
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:34,100
&quot;Hey, why aren't you guys thrashed?! You're totally outnumbered!&quot;

863
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:37,960
&quot;You made a team purely of SUPPORT ENEMIES&quot;

864
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:45,780
&quot;Their bullet patterns aren't balanced at all. It's like a dinner made out of three glasses of milk.&quot;

865
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:49,540
&quot;And that's, um... unusual, somehow?&quot; *chuckles*

866
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:54,240
&quot;Why don't we talk about this AFTER the battle?&quot;

867
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:59,220
Can I spare already? Lemme try.

868
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:02,560
&quot;But the name isn't YELLOW.&quot;

869
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:05,500
I don't get it... but it seems like it gets yellow even when...

870
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:07,800
...From me sparing it.

871
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,900
And... spare, finally.

872
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:13,100
No!

873
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:16,020
&quot;Sweet! How much do I get?&quot; *laughs*

874
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:18,760
&quot;You... lost, Lancer. You don't get any.&quot;

875
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:19,780
&quot;Oh!&quot;

876
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:21,360
&quot;Can I have some of yours?&quot;

877
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,460
&quot;No!&quot;

878
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:24,120
&quot;Fine! Later then.&quot;

879
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:27,260
Jesus Christ.

880
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:28,360
&quot;Sup.&quot;

881
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:29,940
&quot;I thought you were running away.&quot;

882
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:41,440
&quot;Yeah, I finished.&quot; *snickers*

883
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:47,540
Am I doing it wrong?

884
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:50,880
&quot;Ugh, open up you stupid door!&quot;

885
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,320
&quot;Oh, great. It's YOU GUYS.&quot;

886
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:55,840
&quot;Susie! We were ever so worried about you!&quot;

887
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:56,940
&quot;Um...&quot;

888
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:59,140
&quot;How'd you get past those spikes before?&quot;

889
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:00,660
&quot;Walked through 'em&quot; *chuckles*

890
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:02,420
&quot;But this door... sucks.&quot;

891
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:04,240
&quot;Aww, don't worry, Susie.&quot;

892
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:07,380
It'll open after we solve the puzzle over there!&quot;

893
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:09,640
&quot;Nice. Tell me when you finish it.&quot;

894
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:12,200
&quot;Uh, Susie. We need you to finish it.&quot;

895
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:15,040
&quot;Sometimes, proceeding will take all 3 of us.&quot;

896
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:18,160
&quot;Furthermore, only Kris can seal the DARK FOUNTAIN...&quot;

897
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:21,800
&quot;So if you don't accompany us, you won't make it home!&quot;

898
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:24,460
&quot;So you're saying I HAVE to stick with you guys?&quot;

899
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:31,240
&quot;Yep!&quot;

900
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:33,440
&quot;Let's just get this over with.&quot;

901
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:37,760
&quot;Yahoo! Susie's back on the team! Cue the fanfare!&quot;

902
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:50,080
(Passionately singing) &quot;SUSIE JOINED THE PAR-TY!&quot;

903
00:46:50,080 --> 00:47:01,920
(Passionately again) &quot;SUSIE FOLLOWS AT A DISTANCE SUCH THAT NO ONE CAN TELL SHE'S ASSOCIATED!&quot;

904
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:05,900
Aww, so silly!

905
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:10,380
Ok, so now I guess we work... the 3 of us...

906
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:11,580
&quot;Sounded like a door open.&quot;

907
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:13,580
Alright.

908
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:14,380
What?

909
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:17,240
&quot;Oh, Kris! I just realised Susie missed the tutorial!&quot;

910
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:19,340
&quot;Next battle, we should show her how to ACT!&quot;

911
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:22,280
&quot;I think she might really enjoy that!&quot;

912
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:23,020
Oh God.

913
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:25,500
Susie, do NOT hurt this creature.

914
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:28,700
Do NOT hurt this adorable creature!

915
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:32,800
&quot;C round attacked violently! You recalled Ralsie's advice-&quot;

916
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,300
Ok, so...

917
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:39,300
Act.

918
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:46,560
No, let's defend, first.

919
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:51,300
NO! NO!

920
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:54,620
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING!

921
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:56,500
NO!

922
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:58,820
NO!

923
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:03,680
&quot;Heheheheh!!! I sneaked by and made a sign!&quot; (disappears into laughter)

924
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,200
(From the void) I'm quitting there

925
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,580
I'm not killing that thing!

926
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:09,060
Ok, there's a Save here.

927
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:11,780
&quot;Um, Susie, I suppose you missed what I said earlier...&quot;
