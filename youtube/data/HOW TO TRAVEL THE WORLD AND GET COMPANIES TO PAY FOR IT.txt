1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:04,470
I don't know

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:21,390
they make purple chickens this morning

3
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:22,949
was one of those mornings where I really

4
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:26,160
wish I had to fill my run but but I

5
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,529
didn't and I probably ran faster because

6
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:30,660
of it but a solid like thirteen point

7
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:36,410
three mile run this morning feel strong

8
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:39,600
do you think it would be too distracting

9
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,440
to do both mail time and Q&amp;A at the same

10
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,899
time these boxes are piling up I do want

11
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:47,969
to do mail time but it's Tuesday QA day

12
00:00:47,969 --> 00:01:05,189
I'll pick a couple of boxes okay now we

13
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:22,860
can be in QA

14
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:26,860
all right QA here besides filmmaking

15
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:29,220
what are your other passions or hobbies

16
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,350
running and parenting is parenting a

17
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:38,680
hobby you love messy this is lovely

18
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,810
Nick asks what's the best part of owning

19
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,940
your own company you know it's not

20
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,560
owning your own company it's working for

21
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,110
yourself that's amazing and I've been

22
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:49,240
working for myself now I think since I

23
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,090
was 21 or 22 years old it's the sense of

24
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:55,509
agency or sense of control over your own

25
00:01:55,509 --> 00:01:58,030
like destiny or outcome of your career

26
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:01,659
my success or my failure depends on me

27
00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:04,810
and me alone I've got no one to blame my

28
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:07,240
failures on I have no one to attribute

29
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:13,180
the success to but myself I think these

30
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,220
are lights for my skateboard thank you

31
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:18,670
there's no button no name yes hey Casey

32
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,470
we're in Murfreesboro and we're actually

33
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:22,540
in the small animal lab of our high

34
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,489
school and we were just wondering um

35
00:02:24,489 --> 00:02:28,470
what kind of childhood pets did you have

36
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:31,660
what kind of childhood pets all I ever

37
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,609
wanted was a dog and all we ever had

38
00:02:33,609 --> 00:02:36,579
were cats I liked cats but I prefer cats

39
00:02:36,579 --> 00:02:38,950
in Internet videos and I prefer dogs in

40
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,049
real life because dogs are rational

41
00:02:41,049 --> 00:02:44,980
creatures and cats are just like well

42
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:47,950
whoa I can't see my name is Chad I've

43
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,720
made you a little package thanks Chad

44
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,940
thanks these sweet bean stickers these

45
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,739
are actually pretty good stickers what

46
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:55,239
do you miss most from your childhood

47
00:02:55,239 --> 00:02:57,340
there are no consequences for your

48
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,560
actions when you are our child I'm you

49
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,930
like get grounded and make it suspended

50
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:04,239
or detention but compared to being an

51
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,340
adult where things actually matter when

52
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:09,519
you're a kid you can do anything and get

53
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,049
away with it it's just like that sense

54
00:03:11,049 --> 00:03:13,390
of recklessness is really amazing I

55
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:14,890
don't think there's any responsible way

56
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:17,590
to maintain that as an adult Peter asks

57
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,870
do you have any scars are you crazy

58
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,730
Peter I have more scar tissue than I

59
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:24,549
have actual skin yes my entire body is

60
00:03:24,549 --> 00:03:26,870
covered in scars and

61
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:29,270
scars are kind of my favorite tattoos

62
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:32,340
because a scar much like a tattoo

63
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,530
represents something that happened to

64
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:36,900
you or experienced and all of my scars

65
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,700
like I'm just looking at my hands like

66
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,280
look at all the scars just on one hand I

67
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,920
mean that's from like fighting a lot

68
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,290
when I was a kid and Jose asks were you

69
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:49,380
ever bullied in school if so how did you

70
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,070
deal with it

71
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:52,020
oh yeah I was bullied in school when I

72
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,430
was a kid I was really weird looking at

73
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:56,030
big ears and I remember like

74
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:58,350
specifically when I used to wrestle in

75
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:00,870
the sixth grade I'd have to take the bus

76
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,520
with the seventh and eighth graders and

77
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,590
those guys really gave me a hard time in

78
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,600
the moment like I was as much of a spaz

79
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,310
then as I am now they didn't care how

80
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:10,260
small it was I just wanted like totally

81
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,390
ate and tried to this is not good advice

82
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,220
but like when I was a kid nozzle and I

83
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,860
was fight I just fight we wanted to send

84
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,450

85
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:19,860

86
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:25,380

90
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,820
growing up uh yeah I used to run

91
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,280
cross-country in middle school and then

92
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,360
I played lacrosse

93
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,600
I love lacrosse did people ever say you

94
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,200
were going nowhere by making movies does

95
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,310
it ever made you doubt it people who

96
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,870
have abandoned their dreams and

97
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:00,240
aspirations will always discourage

98
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,550
others from pursuing theirs you have to

99
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:04,650
have a blind overwhelming confidence to

100
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:07,770
chase down your dreams anyways so I

101
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,810

176
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:05,120
