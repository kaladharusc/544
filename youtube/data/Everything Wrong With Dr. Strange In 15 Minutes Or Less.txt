1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:10,019
even when you speed this logo up it

2
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:12,030
feels like forever maybe it is do I

3
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,280
exist here is still a page from a book

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,719
so was the ceremonial looking

5
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:17,699
decapitation really necessary in order

6
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:19,230
to steal the book you must first remove

7
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:20,789
the head of the librarian on overnight

8
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:22,769
duty on whatever knot you attack and you

9
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:24,539
must do so while he suspended six feet

10
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:26,519
in the air arms and legs played with two

11
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:28,740
axes all that culminating in the head

12
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,119
landing in ancient Lord du cow's

13
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:32,130
favorite dead pan bucket welcome to some

14
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:33,809
idiotic the first couple minutes of this

15
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:35,370
movie these guys come in murder the

16
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:36,960
bookkeeper and for what but they were

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,340
one page out of a book when they could

18
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,870
easily steal the whole thing they not

19
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:41,550
bring enough help kind of infuriates me

20
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,110
that this will be a big deal later in

21
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,300
2016 audiences were delighted to see

22
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,890
inception - in theatres which they

23
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,539
weirdly called dr. strange I mean

24
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:52,320
strangely called dr. strange like Harry

25
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,789
Potter this movie will never stop to

26
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:55,199
explain what the motions really do or

27
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,030
whose motion should be out wings these

28
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,890
hologram blades do hologram damage to

29
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,480
the bad guys why exactly are these guys

30
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,039
allowed but just leave again can't you

31
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:03,660
put them in an interdimensional jail or

32
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,010
something they killed your bookkeeper

33
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:06,510
she's definitely visible to this lady on

34
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:08,520
the right so it gives you some rules

35
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,750
maybe I bet you're gonna tell me that

36
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,369
will come later but I have my doubts oh

37
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:14,430
gee hot rich I feel so good man charted

38
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,710
in 1978 the album is released in

39
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,770
December of 1977 brilliant cocky

40
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,390
charming guy who gets deeply injured

41
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:22,979
then overcomes that injury to become

42
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:23,430
hero

43
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,290
that's so starkly familiar why are they

44
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,540
alright Bruce Wayne also I don't care

45
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,040
how good a surgeon he is I don't want my

46
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,780
surgeon playing musical trivia with the

47
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,340
nurses during my surgery shows a

48
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,960
detachment from reality that suggests

49
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,490
I'll lose my life and he won't lose any

50
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:38,369
sleep is it yes W for the record doctors

51
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:40,829
of the world GSW literally has two more

52
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:42,270
syllables than the phrase it stands for

53
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:43,290
gunshot wound

54
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:45,000
just sayin yelling don't seem very smart

55
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,470
with this particular abbreviation this

56
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,329
is brain surgery but neither of them are

57
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:50,490
wearing a mask but in that first surgery

58
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,290
scene everyone in the goddamn room had a

59
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:54,360
mask on is it the movie or the hospital

60
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,439
that's playing fast and loose with the

61
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,630
medical rules now they put masks on

62
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,420
the wrists over your watch okay aside

63
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,159
from further humiliating the CR dr.

64
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,630
Ghana the scene exists to show how good

65
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,399
strangers hearing is I guess but if

66
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:06,750
hearing or important during surgery

67
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,280
blasting the hips of the 70s would be

68
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,569
grounds for malpractice suit

69
00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:11,190
movie wants to have its cake and eat it

70
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,629
and have a portrait of the cake made and

71
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:13,740
then eat that

72
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,870
humiliate him in front of everyone after

73
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,670
City's patient either GE has a point

74
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,170
he according to the Hippocratic oath

75
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:21,330
does not yeah you're right in ER we're

76
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,400
only saving live movie not only utterly

77
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,470
waste rachel mcadams that uses her best

78
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,510
acting on a medical walk and talk i got

79
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:28,560
a strange talk

80
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,480
oh well good I'm glad something's named

81
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,520
after me this movie schools Jurassic

82
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,960
world on how to write we used to date

83
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,790
sexual tension dialogue well still being

84
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,170
super cliche and predictable we use

85
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,150
today dialogue point is both movies did

86
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,620
it poorly but Jurassic world did it even

87
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,180
more report I should have to explain

88
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,760
this goddamn I do love the New York

89
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,590
scale is that the King Avengers bluej

90
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,930
building King hell listen if you have a

91
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:51,900
watch drawer if your watches inside said

92
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,610
walk drawers are all spinning as though

93
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:54,930
each is trying to get your attention to

94
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,340
get you to pick them your Vayner than

95
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,810
whoever Carly Simon wrote you're so vain

96
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,760
about this watch suggest it's February

97
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,320
around 2 p.m. even though there's no

98
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,760
snow anywhere in this movie and a

99
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,290
serious shortage of winter coats hats

100
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:06,210
and gloves by outdoor pedestrians by the

101
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:07,650
way where is this out in the middle of

102
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:08,850
nowhere a mountainous region close to

103
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:09,480
New York City

104
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,970
you drive upstate no answering phone

105
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:13,680
calls using your finger while driving at

106
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,660
high speed on this road this guy's

107
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,400
driving 80 miles an hour on a curvy road

108
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,690
in the mountains passing people and

109
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,580
clear no pass zones and he still looks

110
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,170
at the x-ray how did crashing not happen

111
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:24,060
well before this also he survives this

112
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,490
so he crashed way too outside the city

113
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:27,810
in the mountains but somehow his

114
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,580
downtown New York City Hospital he works

115
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,990
at was still the closest hospital or

116
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:32,460
else they flew way out of their way to

117
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,200
take him where he wanted to go and he

118
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,340
was able to tell them where he wanted to

119
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:35,670
go

120
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:42,570
no one could try ranee shoo brain and I

121
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:44,070
drove super fast and distracted and blew

122
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:45,210
off equipment should be happy to be

123
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:47,160
alive but still is all your fault

124
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,020
strange asked his physical therapist

125
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,910
sarcastically if he's ever known anyone

126
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,380
to have this much nerve damage yet still

127
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,240
recover and dude says yes and tells him

128
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,370
about Benjamin Bratt and miracle and a

129
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,050
half that the only dude to do this

130
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:59,070
because he went to the temple of

131
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,810
whatever somehow had the same physical

132
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:02,100
therapist a strange movie should have

133
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,510
just had the temple order recruits ass

134
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,370
this oh yeah there was this one guy but

135
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,290
was kind of insulting actually no one

136
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,430
would be seated during the doctor

137
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,990
strange wants to shave but decides not

138
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:12,209
to shave see I'm not getting any better

139
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:15,000
but still as sad as that is you drove

140
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,590
yourself off a cliff by driving like an

141
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:17,970
asshole late at night in the mountains

142
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,590
I mean exactly how much empathy is this

143
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:20,940
movie expecting me to have with this

144
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,979
entitled sourpuss there are other things

145
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:24,900
that can give your life meaning

146
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,660
why you there relationship survives this

147
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,710
ha

148
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:30,479
France Christine we were barely lovers

149
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:31,710
before turning this movie into a

150
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,330
possible inception sequel it was briefly

151
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:35,010
considered for a season four episode of

152
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:35,729
Grey's Anatomy

153
00:04:35,729 --> 00:04:37,080
so Doctor Strange went looking for

154
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,090
Pangborn and movie skips over the part

155
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:40,320
where strange was able to track him to

156
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,820
this afternoon pickup basketball game

157
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,169
that is apparently inside a cage

158
00:04:43,169 --> 00:04:45,060
underneath an interstate or some point

159
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,350
in his movie skips over some impossible

160
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,790
detective work to avoid showing how

161
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,650
impossible it was in case you confused

162
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:52,280
it with Katmandu génifique converse on I

163
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,570
can see some sort of lucky break like

164
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:56,460
this happening but what Mordo doing here

165
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,690
in the marketplace today he's just

166
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:59,130
standing around hoping to hear someone

167
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:00,449
ask about a place where he works I guess

168
00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:02,400
white guy in Katmandu confronted by

169
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,110
three attackers who punches one of them

170
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,100
with his recently surgically

171
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,199
reconstructed hand forget everything you

172
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,820
think you know I'd like to forget this

173
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,169
line of dialogue since it appears in

174
00:05:10,169 --> 00:05:11,970
roughly one of every six movies Thank

175
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:16,590
You ancient one for seeing you're very

176
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:17,340
welcome

177
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,630
why the could you go through all this

178
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,010
just to make a random stranger think

179
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:21,210
someone else was the ancient one if you

180
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,289
were just going to introduce yourself

181
00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:23,940
immediately anyway just the strange

182
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,889
doctor actually

183
00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:29,190
well no not anymore surely isn't that

184
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:31,200
why you're here well no actually he's

185
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,030
probably still a doctor by degree and

186
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:33,630
experience

187
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:34,979
it's just his hands don't work anymore

188
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:36,510
I'm quite sure he came here to get his

189
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,800
hands working again not to become a

190
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,450
doctor again since that label surely

191
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:41,550
never left also does this mystical come

192
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,320
through school accept all comers because

193
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,639
he got this place's name from a dude

194
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,110
that actually rejected their philosophy

195
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:47,550
and left and he just showed up on the

196
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:49,020
doorstep and yet they took him in and

197
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,430
deemed him worthy of training because

198
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,990
why again they just trained anyone that

199
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:53,910
shows up when I started getting here

200
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:56,190
one-way ticket and you're talking to me

201
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:59,010
about healing through belief isn't that

202
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:00,690
exactly what penguin told strange before

203
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,460
we made this trip but getting his mind

204
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,660
right is how he got his body to heal

205
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,970
hell let's replay that theme my mind was

206
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:08,280
elevated and my spirit deep in somehow

207
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,590
the body healed hell you weren't even

208
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:12,090
skeptical you filled in the blanks on

209
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:14,820
your own oh cool a butterfly but even in

210
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,289
this astral dimension how does the

211
00:06:16,289 --> 00:06:18,090
butterfly live in space or am I missing

212
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:20,710
the point I'm probably missing the point

213
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:25,750
oh my I just realized how Marvel intends

214
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,220
to keep its MCU properties going

215
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,690
perpetually using these Doctor Strange

216
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:30,730
infinite universes and that's bad it

217
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:31,810
opens the door to the marvel cinematic

218
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:34,030
multiverse to pad the runtime the

219
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:35,590
ancient ones compound goes on Fight Club

220
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:38,590
for a few minutes i Silius still has the

221
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:41,170
stolen pages if he deciphers them he

222
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:44,020
could bring ruin upon us all how long do

223
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,310
you think it'll take it he took that

224
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:47,410
ages ago movie time are you all just

225
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:49,600
hoping he has a super slow translator or

226
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,440
something or what's this I'm not sure

227
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,720
the Wi-Fi possibly uh-huh that's funny

228
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,280
but why would you give him a card with a

229
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,840
strange word on it and not tell him it's

230
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,340
the Wi-Fi password as soon as you give

231
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,990
it to him also that password is super

232
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:05,260
hackable flash of the mystic arts is as

233
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,990
old civilization that sentence literally

234
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:10,480
means nothing I like it from here to

235
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,240
there how did you get to reattach seven

236
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,670
nerves and studying practice year's

237
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:19,000
event the ancient one suggests it will

238
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,680
take years years of study and practice

239
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,570
for strange to master this art but the

240
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:23,980
movie will suggest he does it in mere

241
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,960
months because the movie is cheating why

242
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,160
do you wait so long to do this ritual

243
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,660
you still that book way back in the

244
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,860
first scene and even though we don't

245
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,360
technically know when that happened the

246
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,280
timeline it suggested it was before all

247
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,810
the doctor strange habit which means

248
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:36,520
this guy broke in killed fools stole the

249
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,380
book then took what months to do

250
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,940
anything else after that which is weird

251
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:40,300
right

252
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,100
Nach Nicholson said I'll take this rule

253
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,630
but only if I can have something up with

254
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,040
my eyes because he Nouriel is a

255
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,390
tremendous hit basically because of the

256
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:48,580
I think they control it by surrendering

257
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,800
control it doesn't make you must not

258
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,330
have seen the Matrix movies or every

259
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:54,280
pottery or Star Wars I just don't

260
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,420
understand how you can be the chief

261
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,950
librarian of a magic training complex

262
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,540
and this is something that any asshole

263
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,980
can do if they feel like it why aren't

264
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,120
there any other defensive measures in

265
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,890
this place also somebody doesn't hear

266
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:03,940
anything going on because they're

267
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,860
wearing headphones cliche if I told you

268
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,270
everything else that you don't already

269
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:09,280
know you'd run from here in terror what

270
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,570
every officiant should say to every

271
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:12,040
groom in every wedding ever when you

272
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,710
first came to life he's lost everyone he

273
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:15,370
ever loved

274
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,320
by its position it's weirder but he gets

275
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,670
full internet access in the training

276
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,080
dojo or the fact that he sends emails

277
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,880
with the largest font imaginable the

278
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,080
director said let's have your character

279
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,460
eat an apple no make it look like even

280
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,320
more of an asshole heroes like the

281
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,360
Avengers protect the world from physical

282
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,160
dangers not a Marvel movie if we don't

283
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,420
spend a lot of time talking about other

284
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,030
Marvel movie

285
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:34,280
the sorceress safeguarded against or

286
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,890
mystical threads hmm what can't you also

287
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:38,120
use your powers to protect it from

288
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,560
physical dangers again where were you

289
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,940
during all the times the world was until

290
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,169
danger you don't think they could have

291
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:43,760
used some magic outside of Scarlet Witch

292
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,820
a being of infinite power and less

293
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,910
hunker quest to invade every universe

294
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:52,640
and he hungers for us most of all but

295
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,200
somehow this being of infinite power

296
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,030
can't crack sanctum magic okay this

297
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,080
movie just showed us doors that

298
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,360
transport them from their dojo to one of

299
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,190
the three sanctums on earth now inside

300
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:02,930
one of those sanctum strange find some

301
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,820
more instant transport doors all of

302
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,140
which it's kooky to me since we already

303
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,400
saw that they can use a glowy horn

304
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,170
spells they need to transport so why do

305
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:11,420
they need all the magic doors the master

306
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,860
of the sanctum shows up to defend it

307
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,450
just as the bad guy appears but where

308
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:15,530
was he while strange was wandering

309
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:16,940
around this joint literally yelling

310
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:19,220
hello also I mean they place one guy in

311
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,690
charge to guard all this stuff and then

312
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:22,190
they wonder why it fails these guys

313
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:23,270
aren't particularly clever

314
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:25,040
pan-dimensional beings they killed a

315
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,510
master this place immediately with a

316
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:28,400
sword fight but strange it was super

317
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,930
experienced they take a bunch of time

318
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:32,000
just to put it why it doesn't feel like

319
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,440
this fight should be in any way close I

320
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,700
know that strange has learned a lot a

321
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,230
short amount of time this guy's been

322
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,760
doing it for years should be able to see

323
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,110
things differently to the point strange

324
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,430
shouldn't even be able to escape during

325
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:41,900
this fight once again people with

326
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,370
superpowers end up making this a fist

327
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:45,380
fight with a few kicks run it man is he

328
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:48,290
coming a few coming the one-man e---coli

329
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:51,280
butchered that rat a con quote

330
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:54,389
[Laughter]

331
00:09:54,389 --> 00:09:56,620
wait a minute this is movie saying she

332
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,420
can't see the two astral projections

333
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,100
fighting so why could she clearly see

334
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,630
strange when he was helping her operate

335
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,220
on it this is known as playing fast and

336
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,380
loose with the rules also I kind of find

337
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,519
it hard to believe that the physical

338
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:08,019
structure of this hospital has anything

339
00:10:08,019 --> 00:10:09,459
to do with the physics of these astral

340
00:10:09,459 --> 00:10:10,810
projections why are they slamming

341
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:11,980
against walls when they should just be

342
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,630
going through everything so physical

343
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:15,430
voltage translates directly to ask for

344
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:16,990
projection strength for some reason

345
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:18,220
honestly this might be the most baffling

346
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,060
thing in this movie

347
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:21,040
I mean King exploded that guy's ghost

348
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,569
and it caused the real world bad guy's

349
00:10:22,569 --> 00:10:25,089
forehead to smolder that's bonkers they

350
00:10:25,089 --> 00:10:26,709
broke up I made tons of noise during

351
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,269
that revived him so his ghost can

352
00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:29,680
electrocute another ghost stuff but

353
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,420
still all alone and I'm bothered in a

354
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,800
New York City Hospital operating room

355
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,970
and I talked to someone called the

356
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:40,389
ancient one and they joined a cop wait a

357
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:41,920
minute we can't be this dismissive about

358
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,449
strange when you just saw him as an

359
00:10:43,449 --> 00:10:45,130
astral projection a minute ago he can't

360
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:46,660
suddenly turn into Dana Scully after you

361
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,579
bore witness to King magic during the

362
00:10:48,579 --> 00:10:50,110
entire time strange was on the operating

363
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,579
table and beating up a low-rent magic

364
00:10:51,579 --> 00:10:53,440
henchman nobody walked into this closet

365
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,550
and noticed a portal to another world

366
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:56,949
also the holy thing is indefinite he has

367
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:58,600
to manually shut it down why don't the

368
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,649
movie explain this better when they

369
00:10:59,649 --> 00:11:01,449
spent about 15 minutes on this wait he

370
00:11:01,449 --> 00:11:02,800
didn't do anything to shut it down he

371
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,000
just went through it and it shut down

372
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,920
like it's some kind of round-trip portal

373
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,420
when he clearly used a one-way portal

374
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,100
back to Cal Meritage from Mount Everest

375
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,930
earlier and that portal isn't still open

376
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:14,380
at least I think it isn't right right

377
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,550
and would make you in another comment

378
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,050
about how wasted Rachel McAdams is in

379
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:18,430
this movie but instead I'm compelled to

380
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:19,839
talk about the storeroom this is a

381
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,300
supply closet look how big it is look at

382
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,800
how much square footage is utterly being

383
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,930
wasted here how does this hospital not

384
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:27,459
have more storage devoted to toilet

385
00:11:27,459 --> 00:11:29,740
paper you defended the New York sanctum

386
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:32,470
from attack through sheer ping luck what

387
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:34,120
is he talking about I'm talking about

388
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,860
her long life the source of her

389
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:38,019
immortality she draws power from the

390
00:11:38,019 --> 00:11:40,420
dark dimension to stay alive you mean

391
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,949
he's never once wondered why the ancient

392
00:11:41,949 --> 00:11:43,600
one has lived so long the connection to

393
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,860
the doctor medicine makes them more

394
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,779
powerful in the mirror dimension they

395
00:11:46,779 --> 00:11:48,100
can't affect the real world but they can

396
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,810
still tell that and why didn't Casillas

397
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:51,339
do this himself earlier unless you're

398
00:11:51,339 --> 00:11:52,389
telling me that he doesn't have the

399
00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:53,920
power to make a mirror dimension which I

400
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,480
highly doubt you know what I wish I wish

401
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,189
these Stan Lee cameo somehow told a

402
00:11:57,189 --> 00:11:58,569
story over the course of many movies

403
00:11:58,569 --> 00:11:59,920
like if you piece them together it would

404
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,480
be something mind-blowing instead they

405
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,010
continue their pointlessness just so you

406
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:04,899
marvel fanboy can say oh look there's

407
00:12:04,899 --> 00:12:06,430
Stan Lee look I know it's the mirror

408
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:07,570
dimension which the movie

409
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:09,100
defined as basically literally anything

410
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,840
goes but he's folding the city

411
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,880
supposedly but the park top left he's

412
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,770
folding in is actually the same exact

413
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:16,240
mirror opposite of the cityscape that

414
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,160
he's folding it into here here here here

415
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,960
these are all the same buildings he

416
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,000
somehow doubled the city upside down and

417
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,440
movie wants me to act like he bent

418
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,450
Manhattan in half or some and here movie

419
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:27,130
is doubling down on its lie as every

420
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:28,840
building top or bottom appears different

421
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,160
than the building it's about to impact

422
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,930
suggesting this is literally a city fold

423
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:33,700
and not an upside down city clone while

424
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,050
I give the movie points for visual

425
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:36,520
ingenuity they've basically created a

426
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,930
finale fight where literally anything

427
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:39,580
can happen which is the biggest cheat of

428
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,140
all also it's important to note the

429
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:42,910
magic cloak does virtually nothing to

430
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,290
help save strangers life during the

431
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:45,940
sequence despite its obvious ability to

432
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,320
do so if it would I think the mirror

433
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,730
dimension is one big middle finger to

434
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:49,390
cinemasins

435
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:51,070
well she certainly waited long enough to

436
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,750
make an appearance Jesus lady what were

437
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,830
you doing in the last 15 minutes

438
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:55,750
meditating strange realizes who's

439
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,160
shaking hands are back and finally

440
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,870
concedes to the inferior surgeon he

441
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:00,370
hated earlier this is supposed to show

442
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:02,110
growth but honestly if his hands weren't

443
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:03,370
shaking he'd still have insisted on

444
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:04,840
doing the surgery himself he has not

445
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,670
grown at all really see this time when

446
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,170
strange brought in an emergency surgery

447
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:10,570
patient at the hospital responded unlike

448
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:11,710
last time when he and Christine

449
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:13,150
basically had an unchaperoned picnic

450
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,890
date in the operating room okay I feel

451
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:16,060
like I'm getting this movie more sins

452
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,800
removed than I should but hot Jesus at

453
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,850
slow-motion lightning is just the

454
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:20,320
coolest freakin touch in this astral

455
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,820
projection conversation what was the

456
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,590
cloak doing during that entire emotional

457
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:24,970
relationship conversation with Christine

458
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,800
just hanging back giving strange some

459
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,360
space I'm guessing the filmmakers just

460
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,800
wanted a cool draw my cloak to me shot

461
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,090
and didn't give any more talk to it

462
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:33,040
there's a web and wisely seems like

463
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,420
these guys have multiple warriors who

464
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,860
can protect a sanctum so why did the

465
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:38,230
Manhattan branch employ one dude on the

466
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:41,170
wrong side of history well or maybe dare

467
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:44,080
I say it the long side of history I'll

468
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,270
give myself five cents for that don't

469
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:48,430
mom always come and right on cue the

470
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:49,690
main bad guys just happened to be

471
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:51,010
walking down this very street for some

472
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:52,540
reason in the end is this any different

473
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,340
from Superman flying around the world a

474
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,560
reverse time yes yes it is but I still

475
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,670
want to complain about it only because

476
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,170
there are supposed to be consequences to

477
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:00,520
using this power and apparently there

478
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,140
are none so with everything going in

479
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,700
Reverse is there any real danger here

480
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,590
isn't this like just rewinding an old

481
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:07,630
VHS tape can you actually physically be

482
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:08,620
in the way of something that already

483
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,270
happened did I just write that since

484
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:11,950
there are so many space patties in these

485
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,510
Marvel movies now like totally expect

486
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:14,650
Thanos to show up during this

487
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:15,760
confrontation with a completely

488
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,889
different space patty

489
00:14:17,889 --> 00:14:24,490
I've come to bargain and this is what we

490
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:25,660
come to see in movies completely

491
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,490
creative humorous new way to fight the

492
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:28,029
bad guy

493
00:14:28,029 --> 00:14:29,680
strange takes a fairly innocuous warning

494
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,029
about time powers from earlier in the

495
00:14:31,029 --> 00:14:32,709
movie and turns it into pure gold I'm

496
00:14:32,709 --> 00:14:34,120
