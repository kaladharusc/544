22
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,690
we took Oscar to his apartment in

23
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,370
Brooklyn he's grabbing a few things and

24
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:33,350
then we're going to zip back to the city

25
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:35,180
we got to get my little brother and then

26
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,940
that's the whole team Oscar Jesse my kid

27
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,979
brother me and then we got to figure out

28
00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:54,270
what this movie is

29
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:57,070
we made it back to the studio trucks in

30
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,420
one piece we're gonna get everything

31
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:02,170
ready upstairs

32
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:03,820
heading out right now for the first shot

33
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,250
of the day the weather outside does not

34
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:11,740
look super well first out of the day

35
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:12,880
we're going to attempt something with

36
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,890
the drone there's a 50 mile an hour

37
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:16,390
winds so I really don't know what to

38
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:17,020
expect

39
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,790
few minor hiccups to get started here

40
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:20,530
but I think we figured it out I didn't

41
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:22,510
have the rope I forgot it I left it in

42
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,310
Connecticut so I'm going to use an HDMI

43
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,959
cable should be fine

44
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:27,850
Jessi broke the drone before we even got

45
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,500
it in the air but that's also fine

46
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:35,420
Dean is ready to go obviously

47
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:49,329
stuff like what the fuck it stays you go

48
00:02:49,329 --> 00:02:52,879
okay snowboards on just waiting on Jesse

49
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:53,450
down there

50
00:02:53,450 --> 00:03:06,520
he's calibrating the drone

51
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:23,490
tell me when to give the signal okay

52
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:26,230
okay we got a couple of drone shots I

53
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:27,970
don't know if they worked I'm hanging

54
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:30,490
out of the Jeep right now with the stuff

55
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:32,140
you can't go left here all right next

56
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:34,000
left we're looping back around now to

57
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,250
catch up with Oscar and Jessi that might

58
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,350
be it for the drone but I feel really

59
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:40,780

60
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:44,440

least partially broken with it this is a

85
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:07,389
very expensive carbon-fiber 3-axis

86
00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:10,860
gimbal and there's more gear in here

87

88
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:15,610

93
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:29,169
New York City

94
00:07:29,169 --> 00:07:31,360

96

this office is completely destroyed

97
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:46,569
so everything you just saw all of that

98
00:07:46,569 --> 00:07:48,129
was from yesterday that was all the

99
00:07:48,129 --> 00:07:50,259
behind-the-scenes stuff that I shot

100
00:07:50,259 --> 00:07:53,649
about our snowboarding movie today is

101
00:07:53,649 --> 00:07:56,319
whatever it's Sunday the video went live

102
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,629
this morning and I wanted to take a

103
00:07:58,629 --> 00:08:01,240
little bit of time to share with you

104
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:05,110
what it's like to have a movie go viral

105
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,870
to the degree that the snowboard movie

106
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:11,110
went viral you never set out to make a

107
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:13,270
viral video it's like you never set out

108
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:15,490
to make a movie that grosses a lot of

109
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:17,889
money you want to make a great movie and

110
00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:20,379
if it does well in the box office or it

111
00:08:20,379 --> 00:08:21,939
gets a lot of views online that's

112
00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:23,800
fantastic but you always start from a

113
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,240
place of wanting to make a really good

114
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,669
movie because the virality is something

115
00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:27,990
that's

116
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:30,240
wildly out of your control as I was

117
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,550
reading this no word with the movie just

118
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:34,500
made me so happy you know smiling the

119
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,170
whole time that I thought if it made me

120
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:38,910
that happy it's probably going to make

121
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:43,440
other people that happy and if it makes

122
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,230
other people happy well then when I went

123
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:50,460
to bed at like 6:30 a.m. comments were

124
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,750
really good and there were some views

125
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,040
but I couldn't tell if it had actually

126
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,740
like taken off but when I woke up at

127
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,620
8:00 and checked my phone I think it had

128
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,540
done like a million views by 8:00 a.m.

129
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,660
and that is when the excitement starts

130
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,460
shortly thereafter the movie was

131
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,320
trending on Twitter and then once it was

132
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,520
trending on Twitter it was on the home

133
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,470
page of Reddit and then the home page of

134
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,270
Reddit - like all of these news sites

135
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,950
that were tweeting at me and then

136
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,810
somebody sent me like a video clip of

137
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:26,330
German TV no more energy food snot

138
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:30,620
I know my son calm we'll ourselves down

139
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,900
to one hot sensation and then YouTube

140
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,090
put it on the homepage of YouTube and I

141
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:36,440
don't mean like you're a subscriber and

142
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,420
it's on your home page you sign out and

143
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,580
go to youtube and it is home page front

144
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,560
and center and all of this like within

145
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,020
seven hours of actually posting this

146
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,390
thing it's where I am so far right now

147
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:51,200
it is 4 p.m. the movie has 3.3 million

148
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,050
views on YouTube 9 million views on

149
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:55,760
Facebook I was invited to be on

150
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,410
television tomorrow morning don't know

151
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:59,120
if I'm going to do it but the most

152
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,090
exciting thing is Friday two days ago

153
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:04,760
this movie was just an idea if it snows

154
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,620
if we can get the truck if we can get

155
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,810
somebody to go with us if Oscar wants to

156
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:11,330
come skiing with me if if if with a

157
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:13,700
crazy idea behind it and then yesterday

158
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,920
was just absolute chaos trying to make

159
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,670
this happen

160
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:19,400
alright that's all I hope you liked the

161
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,800
video this is so exciting

162
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,450
I wish I could make a movie that was

163
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:25,550
this popular like every week or every

164
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:30,910
day

165
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:40,000
we're doing great
