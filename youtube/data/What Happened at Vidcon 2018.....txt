1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,429
what's up ladies and gentleman of

2
00:00:02,429 --> 00:00:03,929
YouTube look at you 98 come at your

3
00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:05,400
lavas again through the power of the

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,779
Internet and this is my rambling series

5
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:08,250
it's kind of like a little podcast or a

6
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:09,660
vlogging series which I just kind of

7
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,040
talk about life in the universe and

8
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,330
things around us and things that are

9
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,160
particularly interesting to me those you

10
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,450
becoming in for the first time to the

11
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,060
series from the h3 podcast I welcome you

12
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,770
to it I will warn you this is a very

13
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,080
amateur style I just sat down and talked

14
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,640
to the camera like I'm talking to you no

15
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,740
editing no post-processing nothing else

16
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,660
and I do get lost my train of thought

17
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:28,920
occasionally so that's why I call it a

18
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,599
rambling video it's a great video to put

19
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:31,949
onto the background while you're doing

20
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:33,870
other stuff because it tends to go long

21
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:35,399
10 or 15 minutes and I hope you guys

22
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:37,050
enjoy that kind of thing but I want to

23
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,399
talk a little bit about my VidCon this

24
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,770
year because this year's VidCon was the

25
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:43,680
best VidCon of my life and I've done

26
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,000
five now it's one of the best

27
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,410
conventions I've ever had this summer

28
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:47,670
has turned out to be one of the best

29
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:49,860
summers I've ever had and it was also

30
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,440
simultaneously one of the worst summers

31
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,699
I've ever had one of the worst years

32
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:55,020
I've ever had the worst Convention

33
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,300
Center a season I've ever had and I want

34
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,710
to talk about all of the good and the

35
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,690
bad here and it's gonna get a little bit

36
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:01,710
political so for those who were

37
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:02,850
triggered by the kind of thing I'm

38
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:04,619
trying to save it towards the end but

39
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:06,150
I'll talk about the personal stuff first

40
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,560
well for those you who don't care about

41
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,630
the kind of thing I'll warn you before

42
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,100
we get into the like the politics and

43
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,890
like the society based stuff so bear

44
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:14,280
with me

45
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,570
also sticker to the end of the videos

46
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:17,640
that way is less likely that the people

47
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,770
who hate that kind of thing and attack

48
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,600
people for that kind of thing will be

49
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,240
less likely to get triggered or upset or

50
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,430
attacked or defend themselves as how

51
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:27,479
some of them people feel that's fine

52
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:30,450
anyway so as you guys know I went

53
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:31,890
through gastric bypass surgery almost

54
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:35,189
you're getting close to a year ago and

55
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:36,960
in that period of time I lost about 180

56
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,750
pounds little clothes 185 now and I'm

57
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,520
feeling really good feeling really solid

58
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,829
I'm finally building muscle and I'm

59
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:45,479
finally able to walk and I want finally

60
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:46,140
able to get around

61
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,729
I can't walk as much as I would like

62
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:49,320
because I still am dealing with some

63
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,240
pain issues so I still have to use like

64
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,430
a motorized scooter and that actually

65
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,689
was one of the biggest sources are like

66
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:56,520
frustration and pain for me this year

67
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,200
because I was in so much less pain than

68
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,270
I've ever been in but I was in something

69
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,009
some days I would just completely skip

70
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:03,780
my pain medication because even though I

71
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:04,860
was in pain I wasn't enough pain to

72
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,469
where I could just manage it um when I

73
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:09,300
did the HIV podcast last year I was in

74
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,280
so much pain that day that I could

75
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,420
barely stay in the car right there in

76
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,450
the car right back

77
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,879
but we did good we did well this year I

78
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:17,500
was in a good mood when I did the show I

79
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,540
was in a good mood during the show

80
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:20,980
before and after on the ride there on

81
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:21,550
the ride back

82
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,470
just an amazing experience is it's so

83
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,989
different the changes to my body has

84
00:02:25,989 --> 00:02:27,489
made for me and for those of you who

85
00:02:27,489 --> 00:02:29,920
again are considering you know I need to

86
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,360
start doing that I need to do better

87
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,560
maybe I need to start losing weight

88
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,970
maybe I need to consult with a gastric

89
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:35,860
surgeon maybe I need to start working

90
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:38,410
out maybe I need physical therapy please

91
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:40,420
don't wait because the quicker you do

92
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,640
that the quicker you're going to have

93
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,870
that kind of success the quicker you're

94
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:45,069
gonna have the kind of good feelings

95
00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:47,680
that I'm having so please learn from my

96
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,870
bad lessons by not doing the stupid

97
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,730
things I have done in the past or some

98
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:53,049
of the stupid mistakes I'm making how

99
00:02:53,049 --> 00:02:55,299
and I learned from the good things that

100
00:02:55,299 --> 00:02:58,209
I've done and and fix yourself and fix

101
00:02:58,209 --> 00:03:00,430
your body and do the things you need to

102
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,040
do now and I want to lecture you it's

103
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,380
just a suggestion because lord knows it

104
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,269
took me forever to even start the

105
00:03:07,269 --> 00:03:10,060
process and I still have a long ways to

106
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:12,400
go so the ability to walk around VidCon

107
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,510
oh the ability to walk around the

108
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:15,549
parties and the ability to do more and

109
00:03:15,549 --> 00:03:16,780
booked more meetings and meet more

110
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,280
creators and meet more fans and sign for

111
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,440
longer and do more panels and all that

112
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,690
stuff was fantastic and the feedback

113
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:25,030
that I got from the other creators from

114
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,790
the fans from everyone involved and that

115
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,440
includes III as well the creator summit

116
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,569
as well from the YouTube team with just

117
00:03:31,569 --> 00:03:34,600
this miraculous wonderful nice feeling

118
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,540
of like accomplishment and success and

119
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,459
Happiness that I have not been able to

120
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:41,680
feel in a really really long time and I

121
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,030
was not in so much pain that I couldn't

122
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,920
enjoy it I could enjoy every second of

123
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,889
it because here I am doing better than

124
00:03:47,889 --> 00:03:49,750
I've ever done in my life I have not

125
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,609
been this small since I was in high

126
00:03:51,609 --> 00:03:53,410
school and that's saying something cuz

127
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:56,260
I'm still a very large guy the downside

128
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:59,019
is I'm still carrying the weight of that

129
00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:01,090
divorce on my heart and on my head was

130
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:02,680
my first time at the Anaheim Convention

131
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,540
Center or a Downtown Disney

132
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,730
without my ex-wife that was tremendously

133
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:08,470
difficult I I thought about her just

134
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,579
about everywhere we went because these

135
00:04:09,579 --> 00:04:10,959
are places we shared we slept in the

136
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,489
same hotel we went to the same rooms we

137
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:13,720
went to the same stores we went to the

138
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:17,380
same restaurants hmmm that's hard to do

139
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,000
without your life partner that you were

140
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,160
with for seven years

141
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,539
and I did talk to her throughout the

142
00:04:22,539 --> 00:04:25,150
trip and and and Ben share some stuff

143
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:26,830
with her and that was kind of nice I'm

144
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:27,370
so glad we

145
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,440
still have the capacity to do that but

146
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,020
overall that's a very difficult thing to

147
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,639
do with it's also very difficult to deal

148
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:36,160
with some of the backlash that I was

149
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,669
getting from Twitter from elsewhere for

150
00:04:39,669 --> 00:04:41,199
some of the stupid I've said and

151
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,120
done in my past I understand where the

152
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,410
backlash is coming from I understand

153
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:46,270
where people you know dislike what I

154
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:49,570
have to say and and how they feel but my

155
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:53,139
mental illness my anxiety my my

156
00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:55,600
depression my suicidal thoughts my crazy

157
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,780
tendencies were certainly certainly

158
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,889
glaring throughout all of this

159
00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:03,910
conventions

160
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:05,800
through the summer and it's so

161
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,180
frustrating because they talk about

162
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,130
something called impostor syndrome where

163
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:11,560
you feel like you don't really belong to

164
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,760
be where you're supposed to be you're

165
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,289
not one of the people you're not one of

166
00:05:14,289 --> 00:05:16,990
the things you and it turns out I talk

167
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:18,669
to a lot of YouTube creators and we all

168
00:05:18,669 --> 00:05:21,130
feel that way right up to the top I'm

169
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:22,750
not gonna name any names but I've heard

170
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:23,889
that from a lot of people who do we

171
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:25,479
deserve the success do we deserve the

172
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:27,010
things we got it's amazing that we give

173
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:28,780
this Davitt isn't bizarre some of us

174
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,430
process it positively like wow I'm the

175
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,510
luckiest person in the world other

176
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:32,830
people process it like I don't deserve

177
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,300
this I can't wait till they take it

178
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,410
away from me so I can go back to being

179
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:40,180
miserable but we all feel that way and I

180
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,370
don't know as usual mental health is

181
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:44,470
always a big topic at VidCon for me I

182
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,240
will talk to creators and I will talk to

183
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,889
fans fans who were dealing with all

184
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,270
kinds of miserable stuff in their lives

185
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,250
creators who are dealing with all kinds

186
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,050
of miserable stuffs our lives and this

187
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:54,729
year and keep in mind when I go to

188
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:57,250
VidCon I talk to everybody I will talk

189
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,080
to people on all right I'll talk to

190
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,599
people on the far left I'll talk to you

191
00:06:01,599 --> 00:06:03,610
know people are very color every shape

192
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:05,500
every size every political the dial of

193
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,210
dialogues and and ideologues

194
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:09,340
III don't care I don't care people are

195
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,169
people I can learn from people I can

196
00:06:11,169 --> 00:06:12,940
commiserate with people there are a

197
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,530
handful of people I don't want to talk

198
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:16,810
to you could probably name a couple of

199
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:19,990
them right now but they're very very few

200
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:21,729
I will give anybody the time of day I

201
00:06:21,729 --> 00:06:23,770
will take a photo with anybody I will I

202
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:25,389
will you know maybe even has sent down

203
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:26,620
and have lunch with you if you wanted to

204
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,169
bait me mono and mono but I don't want

205
00:06:29,169 --> 00:06:30,610
to debate you I don't argue about that

206
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:31,750
stuff there what I wanted to and I

207
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,460
talked to somebody who's a point of view

208
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,409
I don't agree with I talked to them

209
00:06:35,409 --> 00:06:36,880
about how can we do this better how can

210
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,960
we be better how can we rise above how

211
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,569
how can we create better content maybe

212
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:45,600
we could go back to creating content

213
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,310
that's fun and enjoyable and

214
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:49,380
entertaining people maybe we could work

215
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,090
more towards that is there anything any

216
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:52,470
ideas that you have that would just be

217
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:53,789
fun that would be rewarding for you to

218
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:55,470
be rewarding for your fans instead of

219
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:57,270
all engaging and all this negativity and

220
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,280
all this craziness and some people I

221
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,750
understand do not have the option to do

222
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,699
that some people this entire lives is

223
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:05,130
just built off of being hated on so they

224
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:06,750
have to hate back I understand that but

225
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,580
those of us who do have alternatives

226
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:11,009
maybe we can find better alternatives I

227
00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:12,720
will say that to just about any creator

228
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,550
who will listen to me and most of them

229
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:16,380
will and most of them agreed that's

230
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,180
their saying I feel so compelled to

231
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,710
create that kind of 10 denied content I

232
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:22,050
try it's just it's been squashed out of

233
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23,820
me it's just been crushed out of me

234
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:24,960
because I get criticized him for

235
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,310
everything criticism for everything I do

236
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:28,440
so many youtubers saying I'm ready to

237
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,660
quit so many youtubers saying I can't

238
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,400
handle the stress so many youtubers

239
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,720
saying I can't handle the political

240
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,310
climb and so many youtubers saying that

241
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:38,400
to me this year more said that to me

242
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,289
than bitten and I was very surprised

243
00:07:40,289 --> 00:07:42,389
some of them are so much more successful

244
00:07:42,389 --> 00:07:44,340
than me and they were just frustrated

245
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,590
and burnout and having a lot of pain but

246
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,599
know that this is their job and this is

247
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:50,880
what they need to do so they continue to

248
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,830
do it because they do know they're doing

249
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:53,940
some good they do know they're

250
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:54,780
entertaining people and they're

251
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,639
certainly earning a living which we all

252
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,620
have to do it's just it's so it's just

253
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,870
so difficult and to know how many

254
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:06,270
youtubers are in crisis to know how many

255
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:08,370
youtubers are struggling to know how

256
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:10,770
many of them are just dealing with the

257
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:12,479
world that we live in and how difficult

258
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,659
it is to perform in this way it's really

259
00:08:15,659 --> 00:08:16,800
something it's really something and you

260
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,000
don't have to feel bad for me that's

261
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,759
fine I was built for this I was built to

262
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:23,219
be miserable you guys forget I was born

263
00:08:23,219 --> 00:08:25,919
in the misery molded by it you just

264
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,740
adopted a ministry you know I'm built

265
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,419
for this I'm made for this I function

266
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:32,729
better when I'm miserable I function

267
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:36,329
better when I'm mentally ill that's that

268
00:08:36,329 --> 00:08:37,770
when I'm happy I don't know what to do

269
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:40,200
with it so that's fine by me it's so

270
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,909
difficult to see other creators in this

271
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:45,540
tremendous state of some of the stuff

272
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,040
I've been dealing with ever since I was

273
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,020
a kid they don't deserve it nobody

274
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,610
deserves that nobody I didn't deserve it

275
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:53,850
either so nobody's hurt

276
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:55,260
here's what I will say about mental

277
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,820
health and I this is the best part about

278
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,230
VidCon this year it's why was some of

279
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:00,330
the most healing vidcon's in the world I

280
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:02,010
got a chance to talk to some really

281
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:04,020
incredible people and again I would I

282
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,400
would mention them by name here but I

283
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,750
don't want to Doc's anybody I want to

284
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,790
bring any hate anybody's way and I know

285
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:09,930
there's a lot of people watching me

286
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:12,210
right now who who are here just to tear

287
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:13,530
me apart looking for me to say something

288
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:15,030
very stupid in this video which I

289
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:16,740
probably already have it if not stick

290
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:20,670
around but but they they're they're

291
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,470
people who work in the mental health

292
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:24,600
field and whether it was somebody who

293
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,630
brought along their beautiful little

294
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,980
therapy dog who gave me an opportunity

295
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,510
to just post and relax over the fact

296
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,830
that there was even like a puppy Corral

297
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:33,930
that creators could visit and and

298
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:35,700
bunnies and and play with puppies and

299
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,740
play with bunnies and relax and just

300
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,750
enjoy some good food and some good

301
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,880
drinks and commiserate and and celebrate

302
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,220
everything great about what we do and

303
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,540
then we could walk into the fans and

304
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,100
shake their hands and do signings and do

305
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,720
panels and talk about all of this

306
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,030
awesome stuff so many panels though were

307
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:55,110
dedicated to so much of this toxicity

308
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:57,630
and so much of this misery and VidCon

309
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,280
does a very good job of making it very

310
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,470
positive the panels are not about who

311
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,360
sucks and why they suck and why they

312
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,490
suck and it's more about celebrating

313
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:08,010
people who get that kind of hate whether

314
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:10,860
you are shorter tall fat or skinny

315
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,960
it doesn't matter male or female black

316
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,130
or white doesn't matter you have an

317
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:16,080
opportunity to speak at VidCon and speak

318
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,420
your mind and celebrate what you do and

319
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,620
talk about the problems you were having

320
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,710
but there are so many mental health

321
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,550
panels this year and I just want to

322
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:25,050
celebrate that about VidCon I think that

323
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:27,510
was so amazing and so many mental health

324
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,820
youtubers were there who had this

325
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,410
opportunity and we all behind it I

326
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:33,000
talked to so many incredible people I

327
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,070
made so many new friends whether it was

328
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:36,930
bringing their little puppy over so that

329
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:38,130
they could talk for a little while or

330
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:39,270
talking to me about my divorce or

331
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:41,040
talking about the the issues I've been

332
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,780
having with the the stuff that I've been

333
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,160
dealing with this was the year that

334
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,470
instead of everybody talking to me and

335
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:49,410
me trying to help them and a handful of

336
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:50,610
people letting me talk to them this year

337
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:52,860
it was mostly me talking to them and

338
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,420
getting some of the help I desperately

339
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,820
needed and it made me want to come back

340
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,770
home and just get with my my therapist

341
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:00,060
through that program that you know

342
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,950
sponsors me and and talk to them even

343
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:03,990
more and practice even more and really

344
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:06,150
really get some of this poison out of me

345
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,649
and get some of this

346
00:11:07,649 --> 00:11:10,649
out of me um because I'm in a position

347
00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:13,499
right now where everything I've built is

348
00:11:13,499 --> 00:11:16,170
coming together and you know views and

349
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:17,309
the subs are way up on the channel

350
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:18,990
because of the the cross promo I've done

351
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:21,509

352
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:23,339
money is really really good and I'm

353
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:24,990
physically fit for the first time in my

354
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,759
life and even though my marriage didn't

355

amazing experience where all every door

363
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,660
I've ever wanted open is open if I want

364
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,949
to talk to a game developer they're

365
00:11:46,949 --> 00:11:48,269

366
00:11:48,269 --> 00:11:49,740

368
00:11:51,449 --> 00:11:54,329
money to be made and and and I get to

369
00:11:54,329 --> 00:11:56,429

00:12:03,179 --> 00:12:06,360
other creators and and I have to get

375
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:10,079
mentally healthy to do it I really do

376
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,639
because I'd been so self-destructive

377
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:13,050
since I've got home and I've only been

378
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:14,759
home for 24 hours I managed to do a

379
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:15,899
little bit of damage during that period

380
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:18,029
of time and no no big pieces of damage

381
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:20,040
but here's what I will say no permanent

382
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,889
damage that's that's the rule if you are

383
00:12:22,889 --> 00:12:24,329
in crisis when you're having issues

384
00:12:24,329 --> 00:12:26,459
whether you're on a drunken Thai Rae if

385
00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:28,079
you've gotten really stupidly high are

386
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,790
you feeling self-destructive no permit

387
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,379
of damage anything else can be fixed

388
00:12:31,379 --> 00:12:34,439
that's my goal so I'm going to continue

389
00:12:34,439 --> 00:12:35,819
to decompress I'm gonna continue to

390
00:12:35,819 --> 00:12:37,019

391
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:38,579
