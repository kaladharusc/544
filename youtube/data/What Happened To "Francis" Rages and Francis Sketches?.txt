1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,800
what's up ladies and gentlemen of

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,689
YouTube boogie2988 coming atcha Lavos

3
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:05,100
again through the power of the Internet

4
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,089
today I want to answer a very simple

5
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:08,069
question what happened to my character

6
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:09,929
Francis now it's recently occurred to me

7
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:11,910
after talking to some people in meetings

8
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:13,259
to be a lot of the new subscribers here

9
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:14,790
on the channel don't even know what

10
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:17,430
Francis is or what that character is but

11
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:18,960
have you ever seen any of these viral

12
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:46,350
videos before now one point on YouTube

13
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:47,850
that was my claim to fame

14
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,920
I did these Francis sketches as we

15
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,510
called them I was a character with a

16
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,789
fake list and a fake voice doing fake

17
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:56,160
rage sketches for a very long period of

18
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,260
time fake rage on YouTube scripted rage

19
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,719
was very very popular and certainly if

20
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:01,770
you go to my youtube channel and you

21
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,300
sort my videos by the most viewed and

22
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,830
the most popular they're all gonna be

23
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:06,960
Francis videos and that's let a lot of

24
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,520
people really wondering why I don't do

25
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,380
the character anymore and so I want to

26
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,820
explain that now the first and most

27
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,740
obvious answer is the ad pocalypse

28
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,799
happened basically all my Francis videos

29
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,720
got demonetised I mean look at this

30
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,520
every phrase this video I've ever made

31
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,650
all of the famous ones all the big ones

32
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,390
they're all pretty much to monetize in

33
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:25,860
there aren't demonetized yet they will

34
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,390
be eventually and of course i've

35
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:28,890
appealed all of this to try to get them

36
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,110
to romana ties them YouTube just is not

37
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:32,400
interested they don't want this type of

38
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,189
content on YouTube anymore and so that's

39
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:37,290
a very scary thing to do to create

40
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:39,299
content YouTube clearly doesn't want

41
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:41,430
here but I've often said that I will

42
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,740
continue to do YouTube for free even if

43
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,270
even if there was no pay for it and

44
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,829
that's true I don't want to jeopardize

45
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:48,299
the channel though I don't want to get a

46
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:49,710
strike on the channel I don't want to

47
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,960
lose my monetization I don't want to

48
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,579
become unadvertised or friendly

49
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:55,259
I don't want YouTube to hate this

50
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:56,549
channel so that's one of the major

51
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:58,170
reasons but that's not the only reason

52
00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:59,490
because I've often said I would do

53
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:01,380
YouTube for free if it came down to it

54
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,360
and that's true so a lot of people

55
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,979
wonder why I won't make Francis videos

56
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:06,630
for fermium but there's a second big

57
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,310
reason that really took the wind out of

58
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,500
the Francis sketches specifically if you

59
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,580
ever watch one of those sketch videos

60
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,200
you know that I had a sister character

61
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,490
who is a voiceless care

62
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,440
with dialogue behind the camera who

63
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,480
filmed everything let me set everything

64
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,550
up a hot me clean everything and that

65
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:23,100
character was played by my now ex-wife

66
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,350
why I haven't lived with for over a year

67
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:27,330
so that means I've lost my co actor my

68
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:29,880
co-author my director one of my script

69
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,520
writers and my crew they're all gone my

70
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,200
ex-wife was helping with every single of

71
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,550
those videos and now I don't have that

72
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,590
person in my life to help anymore

73
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,110
so now I have to hire a camera person I

74
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:42,120
have to hire actors I have to spend

75
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,070
money not just on the props that we use

76
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:46,080
not just all the stuff that we break but

77
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,940
on the actual crew as well so you're

78
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,080
looking at three four or five hundred

79
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,910
dollars to produce one of these videos

80
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,560
and they're not going to get monetized

81
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,780
so it's a losing proposition I'm

82
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,210
spending money to lose money for no

83
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:00,330
other good reason and it at that point

84
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:02,490
it just stops being a good idea but I

85
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:03,660
think the third and most important

86
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,310
reason is my heart isn't in it the way

87
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,450
that it used to be and that's partially

88
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:08,400
because the divorce its first because it

89
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,050
just stopped being fun to break stuff

90
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:11,910
especially when you're doing it at a

91
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,500
loss and that's why I've tried so many

92
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,270
different ways to reinvent the character

93
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:17,490
and find ways to fit him here on YouTube

94
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:18,510
because I still love the character I

95
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,310
still love doing it and I know you guys

96
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,360
still are watching it

97
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,490
well sometimes to be honest whenever I

98
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:25,410
post a new Francis sketch or new Francis

99
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:27,120
video or a Francis rage about video

100
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,800
games or something like that the views

101
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,120
are not what they used to be that's

102
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,160
definitely true but it's also the

103
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,810
subscribers are my subscriber numbers

104
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,550
will drop like a rock because there's so

105
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,080
many people who've never been introduced

106
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,430
to Francis before they don't know what

107
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,990
the character is they don't know why I'm

108
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,310
doing it they see this in their

109
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,600
subscription to me they're like I'm out

110
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,400
I haven't heard why I thought this guy

111
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,690
was a nice guy now he's a crazy person

112
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,700
they don't even have the concept or the

113
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,710
idea that Francis is just a character

114
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:52,620
and in this crazy wildly politically

115
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,410
charged world that we are in a lot of

116
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:56,670
people have actually tried to use that

117
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,020
against me they tried to say well look

118
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,220
that's who he really is he's actually

119
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,230
really like Francis he's actually a

120
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:02,790
crazy person he's not actually a nice

121
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,470
guy look at him when he smashes those

122
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,300
xbox looks he was abusing his wife by

123
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,580
throwing Pokemon dolls at her they don't

124
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,930
get that it was sketches they don't get

125
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,310
it that it was an act they don't get

126
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:13,620
that it was a parody of gaming culture

127
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,420
they don't understand that and sometimes

128
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,520
it's really confusing and scary and

129
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,840
sometimes I think that's purposeful

130
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,700
obtuseness sometimes I think that's

131
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,070
willful ignorance but sometimes people

132
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,479
surprise you by how little they

133
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,160
understand the world so before making

134
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,170
this video I've done a lot of soul

135
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,880
searching and I've tried to figure out

136
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,890
do I want to play a crazy person on

137
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:33,780
YouTube anymore and if so how do I want

138
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,610
to do it now you've seen that I've done

139
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:37,470
a few Frances rages about video games

140
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:38,730
and stuff going out of the gaming

141
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:40,880
industry I've done a few Frances

142
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,260
podcasts the split-personality podcast

143
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,730
which I thought was a brilliant way to

144
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:46,440
reincorporate the character but it just

145
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,910
didn't get the views that I wanted if

146
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:49,260
you didn't watch that by the way I will

147
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,190
link in the description box below

148
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,630
hopefully you will enjoy it if you're an

149
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,250
old fan of Frances but the point of this

150
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,020
video is to ask you the very simple

151
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,790
question do you miss Frances or do you

152
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:59,070
just prefer the real me would you watch

153
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:01,110
that stuff if I created the second

154
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:03,060
channel for it if I found a place to put

155
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:03,330
it

156
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:05,580
if I decided to create a patreon and

157
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,440
asked you guys to help me fund those

158
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,910
videos and pay for the actors and pay

159
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:10,410
for stuff like that would that be

160
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,400
something you would be interested in

161
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,630
doing maybe you would upload that

162
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:15,120
content exclusively to patreon I don't

163
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,500
know there's a lot of different ways we

164
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,090
could do this I just want to know if the

165
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:20,010
interest is there so along with this

166
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:22,230
video I'm also going to post a link to a

167
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:24,570
community tab poll if you check my

168
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:25,740
channel in the community tab you will

169
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,120
see it there maybe you saw the poll in

170
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,500
the subscription feed along with this

171
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,970
video I'll link to in the comment

172
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:30,750
section I'll link to it in the

173
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,820
description section I want to know what

174
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:33,990
your thoughts are on this because I'm

175
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:36,090
really really curious as to whether or

176
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:37,560
not you think Frances should even be

177
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,880
part of this channel anymore if it

178
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,290
should be on a different channel and

179
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:41,610
know that I'm going to be reading all

180
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:42,870
the comments I'm gonna be listening to

181
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:43,980
what you have to say when we might do a

182
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:47,100
follow-up video about it as well but the

183
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,080
harsh reality the question is what

184
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,120
happened to Frances YouTube kind of

185
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,550
killed it the day of scripted rages and

186
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,230
scripted narrative stuff here on YouTube

187
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,030
is almost completely gone and if you

188
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:59,700
want to say an f-bomb or an S word or a

189
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,700
B word in your video be prepared

190
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,530
coca-cola is not gonna help you support

191
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,570
that lifestyle no more the only

192
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:08,310
family-friendly maybe we need to be

193
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:10,470
bring family-friendly Frances back that

194
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,150
was a lot of fun maybe that's what we'll

195
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:16,460
do

196
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,010
