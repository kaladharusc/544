73
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,280
is that Candace and Francine are already

friend of Mines like family like guest

86
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:44,000
house situation it's a special place

87
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,650
there and we spent a lot of time at the

88
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:47,600
beach and just hanging out it was just

89
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,650
really amazing family time in a really

90
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:58,159
special place

91
00:05:58,159 --> 00:06:00,629
and then the last thing that I wanted to

92
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:02,819
share with you the reason why I took a

93
00:06:02,819 --> 00:06:05,479
little break from uploading is that my

94
00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:10,979
my grandmother died and it's it's sucks

95
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:14,729
it's sad she's my last grandparent last

96
00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:18,840
living grandparent and yeah I don't know

97
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,669
I when things like that happen when you

98
00:06:20,669 --> 00:06:22,800
lose someone especially a family member

99
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,889
I for me it's just always a time to like

100
00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:29,069
pause and stop and appreciate what

101
00:06:29,069 --> 00:06:31,340
what's most important to you in life and

102
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,780
I'm not angry she lived a very full life

103
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,669
she's an old lady she's almost 90 when

104
00:06:35,669 --> 00:06:36,419
she died

105
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:39,060
but I'm mostly he's like sad for my mom

106
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:42,930
you know I lost a grandmother but I saw

107
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:45,330
a couple times a year and and I'll miss

108
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:46,530
her and it makes me sad that I'll never

109
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:47,250
see her again

110
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:51,270
but my mom lost her mother and that's

111
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:54,990
that's I couldn't imagine so so we spent

112
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:56,819
some time with my mom and I don't know

113
00:06:56,819 --> 00:06:58,740
that's what that's what the last little

114
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,509
bit of time has been like for me so it

115
00:07:00,509 --> 00:07:03,120
was both like it's this juxtaposition of

116
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,849
like celebrating life and family and

117
00:07:05,849 --> 00:07:07,409
summertime and all the things that are

118
00:07:07,409 --> 00:07:09,629
wonderful in life and then on the other

119
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:12,210
side is sort of something really sad and

120
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:15,960
difficult in life all right that's it

121
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,370
start end and kind of a down note but

122
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:21,900
yeah I'll see you tomorrow I always say

123
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,900
