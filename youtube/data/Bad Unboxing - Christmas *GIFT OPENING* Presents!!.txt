puny in his oversized shell but he's

100
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:25,099
time you were sent one it wasn't one I

101
00:05:25,099 --> 00:05:27,530

00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:31,250
and a gay whoa look at that someone made

103

00:05:33,889 --> 00:05:36,680
is this Orbeez I've never really played

105
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:43,560
with an RV before

106
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,990
stink bombs I never knew where people

107
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:48,490
got them I always thought it was kind of

108
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:50,500
bizarre that they were made out of glass

109
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,600
and meant to like shatter because I'd

110
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,310
see him in school and be like seems like

111
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,740
an odd thing to you know have it's cool

112
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,360

114
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:02,860
never threw stink bombs except what I

115
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,740
really need to get someone back

116
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,229

133
00:06:59,349 --> 00:07:00,849
trying to figure out what the hell that

134
00:07:00,849 --> 00:07:03,610
could possibly mean the booty owes the

135
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:06,010
booty owes make sure you ain't booty

136

152
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,520
little bit coarser once an alpaca always

153
