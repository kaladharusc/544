Enix it's like what's off why do you

17
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,840
even have a conference bro you know all

18
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,090
you did was a bunch of trailers for 25

19
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,530
minutes and then it was over

20
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:54,570
yeah and a half of those trailers were

21
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:55,980
trailers that we've already seen the

22
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,469
exact same trailers that we saw in

23
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:00,480
Microsoft and Sony why are they doing

24
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,480
these funny don't do that just put them

25
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,540
back into the games or something yeah

26
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:08,010
either that or making a real press

27
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,780
conference like Ubisoft does where you

28
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,729
bring out the developer so we can see oh

29
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:13,590
man they really have passion on there

30
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,000
cuz we've met a lot of the square Enix

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,619
people employees and devs and they're

32
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:20,250
passionate but we got to be honest with

33
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,170
you your show is terrible and it was

34
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,450
like just a series of trailers if that's

35
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:25,710
what you're want and that's what you

36
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,689
don't want to do that's great and you

37
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:29,909
accomplished your mission but you're

38
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:31,740
gonna look embarrassing in front of

39
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,090
these other ones who are putting in a

40
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:34,500
lot more money and a lot more effort

41
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,689
into it and yes a lot of square-enix

42
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:38,790
developers are Japanese so maybe they're

43
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,320
thinking oh it's too hard to bring the

44
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,930
Japanese guys out and then translate and

45
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:45,479
all this stuff but man no they do it for

46
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:47,070
for a lot of other things y'all need to

47
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,869
do it too so let's jump right in

48
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:50,880
they start off with a good showing of

49
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,560
shadow of the Tomb Raider an extended

50
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,479
look of it me and Joe excited about that

51
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,579
one it looks good

52
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:58,619
you know I there was all that kind of

53
00:01:58,619 --> 00:01:59,969
bullshit about you know that the

54
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:01,950
switching and the Xbox exclusive on the

55
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,780
second one which led me which kind of

56
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,180
pushed me off of it and I

57
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,400
have not yet had a chance to to finish

58
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,960
that one off so I need to finish that

59
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,420
one before we get into the shadow of the

60
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,980
Tomb Raider 3 which will close out the

61
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:16,010
trilogy and really turn miss Croft into

62
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:19,580
the glove that we know so it's looking

63
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,920
good then we go on to Final Fantasy 14

64
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:27,020
patch 4.3 Wow great Final Fantasy 14

65
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:30,200
cross monster on earth great you put

66
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,580
your big monster yeah but that's in

67
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,500
Final Fantasy great if it was in the

68
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,959
Monster Hunter I'd be like yeah captain

69
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:39,800
spirit great fucking Bell got this

70
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,340
married no I got you cuz there are some

71
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,890
people out there they're like but how

72
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:49,250
about Dragons quest 11 this one to me

73
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,320
looked interesting because it looks so

74
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,239
much like Dragon Ball and there's a

75
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:54,950
reason for why the character looks like

76
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:57,200
trunks he didn't look like trunks and he

77
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,120
was collecting dragon balls except for

78
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,830
they were little orbs of energy there

79
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:02,780
were six of them not seven but why

80
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:05,120
because of Kira Toriyama he's the

81
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,070
creator that's pretty cool he has

82
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:10,220
created a lot of monster characters and

83
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,570
characters in the Dragon Quest series

84
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:15,410
and honestly this is huge and in Japan

85
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:17,060
this series we don't know shit about it

86
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,730
11 so yeah they're not insider' like the

87
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,860
national video game of japan i mean

88
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,660
arguably i mean obviously there's

89
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,150
Pokemon and then Nintendo and Mario and

90
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:26,720
stuff

91
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,989
Mario made but but this is perhaps above

92
00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:32,239
that Monster Hunter is crazy popular

93
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,640
there too yeah that's also true but be

94
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,350
from what I saw in the trailer I think

95
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:37,790
I'm actually gonna give this one a try

96
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:39,739
this is gonna be my first Dragon's quest

97
00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:41,450
if I can get to it if it doesn't come

98
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:43,850
out at the same time other bigger more

99
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,560
important games that are a little bit I

100
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,420
don't like you're sure right they got to

101
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,110
stay awake now

102
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:50,000
it's September 4th so we'll see

103
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,010
September 4 doesn't seem like a whole

104
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:54,380
lot and then they showed a trailer for

105
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,750
some really cool it is cool looking but

106
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,430
I don't know anything about it and the

107
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,170
trailer didn't do anything to tell me

108
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:02,600
about it was babylons fall it looked

109
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,459
cool it was like look at this history

110
00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:06,200
this history that happened this time and

111
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,340
this happened this time and this

112
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,690
happened this time I got no fucking

113
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:11,660
context what's happening here things

114
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:17,510
things were a balance for yeah it's just

115
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:18,380
a trailer

116
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,810
he is Florence team only so a ps4

117
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:24,950
exclusive on the computers as well 2019

118
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:27,710
Xbox if you if you're on Xbox that was a

119
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:30,170
little bit of a loss but right after

120
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:32,090
that one almost to apologize for the

121
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:34,310
fact that it is they showed me near is

122
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:39,470
coming to great on PC I feel like I'm

123
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,300
pressured to say it's a great game it

124
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,280
was a little boring for me and the color

125
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,450
palette is not my kind of thing but but

126
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:49,190
I heard from Joanne from other people

127
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,990
that I if you if you stick with it it's

128
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,370
a good game it's got a good story

129
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:54,200
so many endings to that and so yeah and

130
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,760
when you beat it the first time you get

131
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,190
a whole nother campaign it just keeps

132
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:03,560
going but here's the thing is that

133
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,390
because the graphic design didn't really

134
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:09,010
appeal to me you know some games just

135
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:11,960
so-so that's coming for Xbox people it's

136
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,180
already been revealed at the EDC so a

137
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,540
lot of this stuff was already revealed

138
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,220
okto path traveller we already knew that

139
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,750
was coming the devil is already out I

140
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:29,600
got the room with the echo and you know

141
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,340
sort of blurred backgrounds I dig it

142
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,020

143
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,240
coming pretty soon then just cost four

144
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,130

145
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:39,290
but they did a features trailer a year

146
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:41,150
which is a little good you know a

147
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:42,980
dubstep but I'm telling you guys with

148
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,810
the tornado the lightning the sandstorm

149
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:46,880
is the blizzards and that war that I

150
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,130
described to you I want to maybe try to

151
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:51,320
get a hold of these developers or Square

152
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,480
Enix and be like do you think you could

153
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,760
do me a favor I'm gonna sell copies of

154
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,530
Just Cause for because I was so

155
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:59,330
impressed by this little war thing so in

156
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:01,940
the game demo he literally just flies in

157
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,520
his wingsuit across this river where

158
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,470
they're having a warm talking tanks I'm

159
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:07,910
talking Rockets and I said this in the

160
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,620
other video in one of the other

161
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,650
conferences it was really fucking cool

162
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:14,810
and then there was a tornado that we

163
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,880
were trying to direct to destroy all

164
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,940
these fuckin military guys and there's

165
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,860
it's crazy because they're going crazy

166
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,210
in this world they have actually have

167
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:25,460
wind turbines that direct the tornado

168
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,979
which Heather so you had to blow up

169
00:06:27,979 --> 00:06:29,600
these fucking wind turbines that were

170
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,370
preventing the tornado from coming to

171
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:32,419
the military

172
00:06:32,419 --> 00:06:34,400
so once you blew that up you got to see

173
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,800
fucking plans get lifted up and crash

174
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,020
into each other whether it's explosive

175
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,820
oh yes there's weathers weather

176
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:44,360
Dominator weather Dominator is amazing

177
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,190
it's batshit crazy and then they were

178
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:47,810
attaching things on everything and then

179
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:49,550
giving them little rocket boosters so

180
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:50,750
you know all those little things that

181
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,040
you could do well they'll follow you

182
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,020
little Aldo track you so you can fly in

183
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,870
with a parachute with like 19 fucking

184
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:59,960
barrels explosive pounds yeah and you

185
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,700
can come with cows and council follow

186
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,010
you around with balloons and then you

187
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:06,560
can drop them all it's fucking crazy so

188
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,350
just cause for because of that good

189
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:12,710
showing behind closed doors it's got me

190
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:15,470
really really freaking excited and guess

191
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:18,080
what it made it on my Mohsen excited

192
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,190
about after e3 list at number fucking

that's how impressive that behind the

195
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:28,070
closed doors demo was above battlefield

196
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,960

gonna be great so that one was a great

199
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:41,090
showing however we've seen it already

200
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:43,900
and these other ones the only real

201
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:47,210
unique and surprising thing outside of

202
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:49,250
some Dragon's quest and babylons far

203
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:52,280
where we got nothing was quiet man see

204
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,710
when I first heard this somebody tweeted

205
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:56,419
at me I hated to make it a game about

206
00:07:56,419 --> 00:07:58,160
you remember when I just said like quiet

207
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:06,590
ya know this is this was weird man this

208
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:08,750
was a delivery boys got a little brown

209
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,870
bag lunch bag or something done and he

210
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:15,200
beats up Hispanics jug for no reason

211
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,820
never he's like after he'd beat him up

212
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,010
he puts the food or whatever it is on

213
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:21,050
his face oh yeah here you go

214
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:23,570
I didn't know that so so here you have a

215
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:26,510
bunch of law-abiding Hispanics talking

216
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,130
to each other having a great time in a

217
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:31,070
dark alley right Joe and then all of a

218
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:36,169
sudden this fucking white guy shows up

219
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:40,110
yeah I think you're in the wrong area my

220
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:44,670
man delivery would blow any this is Ari

221
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:51,390
and me was like Rock address dog no one

222
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:54,390
or no child and and then he starts

223
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:56,190
beating the middle oh it goes from

224
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:58,800
live-action to video game what the hell

225
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,470
is with that what is this new thing

226
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,970
where we're getting a lot of live action

227
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:04,940
with video games did quantum breaks

228
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:07,110
start this and a lot of developers

229
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:08,610
thought that this would catch on so they

230
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:09,630
did their own games now they're

231
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,010
revealing these games and they realize

232
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,690
oh shit this didn't kind of work out as

233
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:16,470
well he delivers pain and since oh so

234
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:18,779
the quiet man is basically going to be

235
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:23,370
the same so the so here's my opinion on

236
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:24,810
quiet man it's gonna be the favorite

237
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:27,839
game of angry white guys and Trump

238
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:34,800
supporters they do not represent my

239
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,290
friends oh so you're right you're you're

240
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:39,720
you're white sometimes what happen is

241
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,980
this is the game that you've always

242
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,200
wanted to beat up Hispanics in the dark

243
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:43,730
alley

244
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:47,010
it's wish-fulfillment because white

245
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:48,570
people feel so scared when they go in

246
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:49,830
the dark alleys they see a bunch of

247
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,540
minorities they're like oh man there

248
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,520
might beat me up this is the game they

249
00:09:53,520 --> 00:10:01,020
play so they could be like just because

250
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,150
just because they said hey man get out

251
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:11,279
of here would you say to me oh my god

252
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,760
wait a minute Joe so they couldn't even

253
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,250
hear the insults they couldn't even hear

254
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,990
the light insults and tell them to go

255
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:21,060
away so he just beat him up for no

256
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,550
fucking reason this was every white emo

257
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:25,940
kid I don't know oh my god

258
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,930
obviously we're joking about all the

259
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:29,670
redhead stuff in the Trump supporters

260
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,640
but there might be some truth again I'm

261
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,100
out you gotta tell me Dow does this seem

262
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,980
like a fun game to meet I believe the

263
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:41,180
fifth an absolute little bit I can't say

264
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:44,060
yes it's fun we're having fun here we're

265
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,390
just making fun of this anyways so does

266
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:48,380
it look like a game you want to play

267
00:10:48,380 --> 00:11:00,320
though I didn't even see that I'm just

268
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:06,470
gonna try the game anyways finally we go

269
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:09,110
to Kingdom Hearts 3 which again is old

270
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:12,050
footage what the fuck is going on it was

271
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:14,900
horrible audio my god was it fence it's

272
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,210
just it was off ok I gotta say this I've

273
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,370
never seen a single trailer at e3 in

274
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:21,620
like seven years of watching it that

275
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:24,380
came anywhere close to how bad the

276
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:32,630
Kingdom Hearts trailers I know it felt

277
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:34,640
like a technical difficulty and that's

278
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,100
not what you want for the thing because

279
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,300
I guess they thought that the voice

280
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,040
acting was so good they put it on the

281
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:44,660
music was so good still Sora that

282
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:47,630
doesn't mean you should change except

283
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:50,630
the power you're given find the hearts

284
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,630
joined

285
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:55,480
it was motions conferences though no

286
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,699
there was no sound effects and we were

287
00:11:57,699 --> 00:11:59,529
all like is something wrong it was like

288
00:11:59,529 --> 00:12:01,420
putting emphasis on these really

289
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:04,029
terrible lines of dialogue but anyway

290
00:12:04,029 --> 00:12:06,910
it's bad but no but I know it by heart

291
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:09,190
cuz my heart he is in my as heart is in

292
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:12,600
my heart

293
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,449
Roxas does exist his hearts inside my

294
00:12:16,449 --> 00:12:19,329
heart we have to do something fun for

295
00:12:19,329 --> 00:12:22,209
the verity on that in that case by all

296
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:25,959
fades nothing new it please us more than

297
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:32,910
Roxas is return of course and Roxas yes

298
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:36,040
anyway Shadow the Tomb Raider I think we

299
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,569
already talked about that so basically

300
00:12:37,569 --> 00:12:40,079
just a series of trailers pointless

301
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,519
really we only got to meet you know a

302
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:44,769
few faces of these maybe the Tomb Raider

303
00:12:44,769 --> 00:12:46,930
guy there's captain spirit guys but

304
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:48,910
other than that it was just trailers

305
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:51,040
awful so final verdict we're gonna go

306
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,959
with the del for below average yes

307
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,399
slightly below average I'm gonna agree

308
00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:00,790
with that um we have technical problems

309
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:03,819
it was we saw everything pretty much is

310
00:13:03,819 --> 00:13:06,310
that already shown and nothing was cool

311
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:09,459
yeah I actually think it's worse than eh

312
00:13:09,459 --> 00:13:11,259
press conference but I'll let you give

313
00:13:11,259 --> 00:13:15,250
it a rating before I want to give this

314
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,589
thing like if there's no point to this I

315
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:19,779
want to give it like a 2 or 3

316
00:13:19,779 --> 00:13:23,290
I'll give it a 3 3 out of 10 not a 2

317
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:25,540
because the games have saved it but

318
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:28,269
we've seen all of this elsewhere and all

319
00:13:28,269 --> 00:13:29,769
you're doing is you're playing trailers

320
00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:30,819
for the game you're not even doing

321
00:13:30,819 --> 00:13:32,920
gameplay demos and not even doing

322
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,660
narrative experiences you're not even

323
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,519
showing us how passionate the developers

324
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:38,019
are about your games you're not even

325
00:13:38,019 --> 00:13:39,790
showing us how great of a company Square

326
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:41,680
Enix used to work for like gubisov

327
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,319
means de so it's a like last year they

328
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:46,600

329
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:52,199
like 14 patch 3 point 4 no patch 4.3

330
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:54,310
under the moonlight let's give it a name

331
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:57,180
because it doesn't sound good at all

332
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,420

336
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,420
I saw the internet just make fun of this

337
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,880
thing and and just tear it apart and I

338
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,790
disagree with you guys I think it's mean

339
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:17,330
for you all to do that because I do like

340
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:19,890
the fact that a lot of these sort of

341
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:22,230
indie PC games have a place to get shown

342
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,390

Oprah's it's so over the top such a

366
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,690
crazy idea that you're the shark and you

367
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:38,400
level up and you could do these things

368
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,320
you're attacking people and it was like

369
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,180
what's the third game like that that you

370
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,650
played a sharks attacking other people

371
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:45,330
just on Steam I forget what it was it

372
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:47,250
was like a multiplayer kind of depth

373
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:51,240
yeah but this one is more like become

374
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,300
the Megalodon Megalodon you know they

375
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,890
need to have a muddler dawn up in the

376
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:58,110
game so that maneater was one of the

377
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:00,870
better reveals there we saw him man 2 we

378
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:03,210
saw what was what was the other thing

379
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:04,650
just cause but that had already been

380
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:06,870
shown off at other press conferences

381
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:10,110
they sort of start off with these little

382
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:12,420
snacks with the duck thing that I've

383

391
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:28,740
apparently was handing out candies and

392
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:31,079
things at you know on the floors I saw

393
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:33,630
him walking around I was like do we

394
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:36,060
really want to tell whatever strange

395
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,490
candy from a guy dressed like soot warm

396
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:43,529
and like fall into Borneo weathers yeah

397
00:16:43,529 --> 00:16:46,740
so anyways we did eat those tablets long

398
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:51,389
time Dragon Ball Z tablets Japan 10 year

399
00:16:51,389 --> 00:16:53,880
old candies anyway so they showed off a

400
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,130
game called satisfactory first looked

401
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:59,730
like a survival type of game it's for

402
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:01,800
people Ando factorio it's a game where

403
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,180
you build huge factories that cover

404
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:06,360
entire map oh it's this map of 3d okay

405
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,850
literally just 3d factorio gotcha and

406
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:10,530
you're just building like a city in huge

407
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,439
wellness it's just a massive factory

408
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:15,089
factories factories it's all factories

409
00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:16,890
so yeah you see so we're starting off

410
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:18,900
with although I I happy that there

411
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:19,919
because there's an audience for the

412
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,780
Train it's just not something that you

413
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:24,120
can get super excited about neo cab was

414
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,500
next it was like this little cool

415
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,780
cartoon world and had a nice music I

416
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,419
don't know you know much about it but I

417
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:32,520
want to play it just from that maybe a

418
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,780
text adventure then we had another

419
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,730
battle where we have multiple battle

420
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:38,610
Royales here we had realm royale which

421
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:40,860
is a fantasy version with magic which

422
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,990
apparently one of my buddies was saying

423
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:44,520
some works surprisingly well when you

424
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,470
mix magic into it I forgot who it was

425
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:49,919
and then not only him but I think

426
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,690
Anthony Anthony was saying it was kind

427
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:53,250
of cool but then you have Mavericks

428
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,020
proving grounds which that sounds for a

429
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,100
million proving grounds it's like a

430
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,169
different game Mavericks is a battle

431
00:17:58,169 --> 00:18:00,600
royale with a thousand players that's

432
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,809
their thing the trailer did not give the

433
00:18:03,809 --> 00:18:06,540
game any positive praise yeah it was

434
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:09,150
very the dude was super young way

435
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:10,559
younger than me making me feel like an

436
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,860
old fuck ya fart I mean an old fart is

437
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:17,040
what I meant and so then we move on to

438
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,750
the Forgotten City which did you know

439
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,700
this was a mod for skyrim they've got a

440
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,440
screenwriting award and now it's doing

441
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,480
its own game you got this investigative

442
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,640
kind of stuff I love that kind of shit

443
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,200
and so that's why I'm appreciative of

444
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,480
the PC gaming show that it gives time to

445
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:30,909
these

446
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:33,220
that you will not see you won't see this

447
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:35,259
at Microsoft you won't you'll probably

448
00:18:35,259 --> 00:18:36,759
see it for half a second you know enemy

449
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:38,889
yeah but they got to talk about it and

450
00:18:38,889 --> 00:18:41,559
stuff and of course my boys a star dock

451
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:44,080
star control origins hell yeah

452
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,809
really looking forward to that game you

453
00:18:46,809 --> 00:18:48,399
know they did Galactic Civilizations

454
00:18:48,399 --> 00:18:50,769
three with tons and tons of additional

455
00:18:50,769 --> 00:18:52,239
content for that game they know how to

456
00:18:52,239 --> 00:18:54,369
take care of their fans and I love that

457
00:18:54,369 --> 00:18:55,869
company in the same way that I love

458
00:18:55,869 --> 00:18:58,690
paradox and CD Projekt RED and Brad is

459
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:01,090
just an awesome CEO he's played video

460
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:03,009
games with us he watches as our movie

461
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:05,080
reviews he's just a great guy and he

462
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,570
makes honey there's a beard caretaker so

463
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:09,279
he's keeping the world alive we need to

464
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:13,450
be the live means anyway so but this let

465
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:15,729
you visit thousands of different and

466
00:19:15,729 --> 00:19:17,830
unique planets it lets you talk with the

467
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:19,720
aliens and it brings that nostalgia back

468
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,849
to me of you know when you when you see

469
00:19:21,849 --> 00:19:23,289
the little guys and you meet them and

470
00:19:23,289 --> 00:19:25,179
they open up on the viewscreen like Star

471
00:19:25,179 --> 00:19:26,919
Trek you talk to them visit exotic

472
00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:28,899
worlds meet new people and there's no

473
00:19:28,899 --> 00:19:32,950
fucking kill them I think they're pretty

474
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:33,549
awesome

475
00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:37,259
yeah Joe it ain't Galactic Civilizations

476
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,429
there's a multiplayer mode now the

477
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:41,409
multiplayer mode is to sample for these

478
00:19:41,409 --> 00:19:43,299
days I'm gonna be honest with you

479
00:19:43,299 --> 00:19:44,470
because you're just getting the ships

480
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:45,820
and you picked multiple ships and then

481
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,919
you just go at it in an arena that was

482
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:49,869
fine for twenty years ago ten years ago

483
00:19:49,869 --> 00:19:51,669
but now you kind of want a little more

484
00:19:51,669 --> 00:19:53,080
than that maybe you want a fleet scale

485
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,639
you want something else but no they're

486
00:19:54,639 --> 00:19:56,349
just gonna recreate the original but I'm

487
00:19:56,349 --> 00:19:58,779
most excited about just going and

488
00:19:58,779 --> 00:20:01,059
exploring the galaxy and meeting alien

489
00:20:01,059 --> 00:20:04,629
races and then fuck you so can't wait

490
00:20:04,629 --> 00:20:06,580
for that one then then they showed

491
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,590
there's too much to talk about actually

492
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:10,899
at the PC game show we have rapture

493
00:20:10,899 --> 00:20:12,789
rejects to point hospital don't starve

494
00:20:12,789 --> 00:20:14,739
Hamlet Overkill's Walking Dead telltale

495
00:20:14,739 --> 00:20:19,450
Walking Dead Walking Dead final season I

496
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:22,989
hope so anyways so and then they did

497
00:20:22,989 --> 00:20:24,609
they did some warframe stuff they talked

498
00:20:24,609 --> 00:20:26,320
about sacrificing the Tenno con live

499
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,970
coming up will be at 10 o con oh yeah

500
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:30,220
there's a sign this is another company

501
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:33,170
would really fucking love and extreme

502
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:35,540
the best Canadians best people out there

503
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,460
in my opinion so much fun going over

504
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:39,020
there and then one final thing to talk

505
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,580
about is the sinking city it's a

506
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:43,130
Lovecraftian open world and I think all

507
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:45,710
great anything to bring us away from

508
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:48,410
fuckin zombies I'm okay with

509
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:50,780
Lovecraftian stuff you know because we

510
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:53,060
haven't seen it before yeah there there

511
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,680
are some zombies in that world but

512
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,600
there's deep ones that come up from from

513
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,730
under there's cult worshippers and said

514
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:00,440
shit like that so it looks like we're

515
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,850
gonna start to get some of that so

516
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:03,800
they're into me there are some

517
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,320
highlights for the PC gaming show and I

518
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,620
think people are really hard on it but

519
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:11,600
obviously when you compare it to the

520
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,670
other ones their games just they're not

521
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:16,640
exciting as exciting and and I don't

522
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,680
think that's what it's about so I feel

523
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,530
bad to try to rate it lowly but here we

524
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:21,710
go

525
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:27,470
so so with that being said I'm gonna

526
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:31,250
give this a 5 its average but it's

527
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,380
compared to everything else yeah I feel

528
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,150
like they shouldn't even be there

529
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:40,220
because it takes away at a revive listen

530
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:42,440
listen they shouldn't be there because

531
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,230
like it's taken away from all their new

532
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,460
games they're trying to showcase

533
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:49,010
everything yet but it's gonna get buried

534
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:52,640
with everything yes so it's it kind of

535
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,530
sucks for them and I feel bad for them

536
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:56,750
they have great stuff yeah some of it

537
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,600
just getting hidden yeah presentation

538
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,180
and what do you think I'm at a four

539
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:05,210
because it was a PC gaming show and it

540
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:06,860
did really nothing at all to pull people

541
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:10,190
to play PC games that's a good fucking

542
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:14,440
pause it's a PC gaming show with that

543
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,670
it's unfair because you know Microsoft

544
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:18,890
and sorry they get the deep pockets to

545
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:21,230
try to bring those people over there and

546
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:23,390
really so so it's it's sort of a

547
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:26,390
slapdash show it's an indie show and if

548
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:28,220
you look at it that way they did their

549
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,960
job and I would rate them a lot higher

550
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:34,490
but because they market themselves as a

551
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:36,080
conference and they're up against it I

552
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,180
just have to rate them in accordingly so

553
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:41,630
I think average is well maybe slightly

554
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:43,010
below as well

555
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:45,320
maybe four out of ten five out of ten

556
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,300
the thing is day nine does a good job

557
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:50,000
but there was technical issues and I

558
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,020
don't know the shtick is getting a

559
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:54,110
little boring over there Knowles how

560
00:22:54,110 --> 00:23:01,420
does one run a hospital into a hospital

561
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:04,430
wait oh my gosh is the stethoscope

562
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:07,400
eliminating your microphone oh you know

563
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,080
what

564
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,790
we do this every year come here talk to

565
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:13,640
me okay how do we run a hospital so

566
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,280
two-point Hospital is a game about

567
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:25,400
designing and so yeah it's it's

568
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,110
difficult because you know I want to be

569
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:29,120
nice to them because they are giving

570
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,320
time to games that wouldn't otherwise

571
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,090
get time but when you're comparing to

572
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:34,490
the other ones it was a lackluster show

573
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:35,390
to say the least

574
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:37,880
and and of course twitch is real mean

575
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,640
and and YouTube gaming and chat and

576
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,350
twitch chat real mean to them and they

577
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:44,480
make them a joke but I side with those

578
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,000
guys and I think it's cool because you

579
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,320
know they get some time like star

580
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,320
control origins man-eater and all that

581
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,390
stuff but all right guys but that was

582
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,070
pretty much the highlights from that

583
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:57,800
star control origins man-eater and maybe

584
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:04,100
the sinking city right but you know it's

585
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:07,310
not something that's like whoa yeah all

586
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:09,890
right guys that's enough so so those

587
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:12,890
that wraps that wraps it up yep that

588
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:16,880
freaking wraps it up III 2018 let's talk

589
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,290
a little bit about how the show did what

590
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:22,460
did you think about the show in general

591
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,260
I think it was a little bit of a waiting

592
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:28,730
year it was probably one of the most

593
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:32,150
have painfully averaged III s that I've

594
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:34,520
ever watched and the sauce that nothing

595
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,860
really big was there nothing that like

596
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,210
blew you away and I mean looking at

597
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:44,690
obviously a lot of yeah everything's

598
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:47,630
coming out way too far out exciting ones

599
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:50,300
rather and and and they didn't want to

600
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:53,000
show off yeah more gameplay than showing

601
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,320
off a gameplay a lot of trailers a lot

602
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,530
we're not gonna show you now lot of

603
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:01,170
teasers and and I just want more

604
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:03,060
extended gameplay and stuff like that

605
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,620
and to help make this video more

606
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,390
exciting since these were the worst and

607
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:09,110
kind of a little boring I will reveal my

608
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:14,580
top 15 games in order after seeing

609
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:17,010
everything in e3 this is in fucking

610
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:18,840
order of excitement after getting

611
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:23,810
hands-on in figuring out so number 50 15

612
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:28,770
Super Mario Party then fallout 76 death

613
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:31,290
stranding above that Resident Evil 2

614
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:34,590
above that halo infinite surprisingly

615
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:36,660
though I know nothing about it I am that

616
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,790
excited about Halo that I'm gonna put it

617
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:41,640
above death stranding and fall out and

618
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,220
then doom eternal cuz gotta give some

619
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,080
love to do and we love that game so much

620
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,150
and I'm excited for the potential last

621
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:50,940
of us to surprisingly a little lower at

622
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:53,610
number 9 I didn't expect it to be so low

623
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:55,380
at number 9 I think that's because I'm

624
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:58,110
suspect on the story yeah I'm really

625
00:25:58,110 --> 00:25:59,760
impressed on the graphics but I'm

626
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,560
suspect on the story on whether I'm

627
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,810
gonna get into it Assassin's Creed

628
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:06,030
Odyssey managed to jump ahead probably

629
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:07,830
because I got hands-on time with it and

630
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:10,230
I was really impressed I'm happy in the

631
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:10,530

635
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,430
so well put together

636
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:22,890

639
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:29,250
fantastic battlefield and you're gonna

Ghost of Tsushima I think it's gonna be

652
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:52,620
great

653
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:55,620
number 3 Beyond Good and Evil 2 they're

654
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:57,330
not presenting it correctly it is a

655
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:59,400
heavy hitter it's people should be

656
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,110
talking about this one just as much as

657
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:03,630
Red Dead Redemption 2 which is number 2

658
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:05,790
even though it wasn't at the show I'm

659
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,800
fucking cheating that's a cheating

660
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,920
that's how much I

661
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,050
care about Red Dead Redemption - got a

662
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:14,350
10 out of 10 on my last review and then

663
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:18,120
cyberpunk of course 2077 just

664
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,290
obliterates the show when we'll see that

665
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:24,450
game I don't know 20 20 20 19 at the end

666
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:27,790
I think it's gonna be beginning 20 20 or

667
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:30,700
end of 2019 that's not based on any

668
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,830
inside information that's just based on

669
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:37,450
gut feel so that's yeah oh but I

670
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:39,670
purposefully left off star field and

671
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:42,460
Elder Scrolls 6 because they were just

672
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:45,520
logos yeah I can't put just logos on

673
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,950
there if if I put those on there then

674
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:51,070
those would be top 5 easy you know so

675
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:53,350
