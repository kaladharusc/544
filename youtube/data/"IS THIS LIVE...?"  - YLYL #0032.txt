00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,230
Do you guys like to cringe?

2
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:03,060
I like to.

3
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,640
In case you haven't noticed I'm kind of a cringy guy.

4
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,060
Put me in any

5
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:08,760
real-life scenario,

6
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,360
and I just won't know how to handle it.

7
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,560
*Clip of professional Pewdiepie handshake with Conan plays.*

8
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:19,200
That was awful.
It turned into a high-five and it just fell apart.

9
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,960
It was...I never want to do that again.

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:21,880
*Laughs at himself*

11
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:25,260
But that's what makes me appreciate the cringe even more,

12
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,760
because I understand the cringe.

13
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,510
I bleed for the cringe.

14
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:32,770
So without further ado, let's go through some of my favorite cringe

15
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:36,660
Special TV Edition™️! Hooray.

16
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:43,760
You're really scraping the barrel now Felix, I love this because it's basically how I do all my intros

17
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,160
*professional sounding intro music plays*

18
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,280
*Pewds laughing*

19
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,180
*snicker*

20
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:55,720
*sounds of fumbling papers or microphone feedback*

21
00:00:55,720 --> 00:01:01,900
*Pfhh, hah!*

22
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:07,600
- Hello and welcome
- Thank you, I never felt so welcome! How natural that was

23
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:15,720
He just turns around like he's so confused the look of terror

24
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,940
Hello and welcome

25
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,760
to this vi-de-o...

26
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,840
Hope you guys are looking for...

27
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,560
*hehehe*

28
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,380
I don't know what it is with TV cringe

29
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:26,480
It's just funny cuz it's so it's such an organic cringe

30
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,540
You know what I mean?

31
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,360
When that thing happened with Conan, you know

32
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,580
I know! You see it in my head. I'm calculating

33
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:36,990
I'm like, yeah, I'm sure they'll edit that out. Yeah, I trust the editing system that they won't draw attention to it

34
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:42,040
They will just cut it out. No! And that's why we, you know, it's live you get these beautiful moments

35
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,149
Okay, this one! My boy. My man

No

Pewds: Ohh no!

53
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,060
Anchor: That's okay, go for it! Tell us!

55
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,940
Anchor: What do you have? What can you offer?

56
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,940
...

57
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,160
Richard: That...
Pewds: *groaning*

58
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,080
Pewds: Come on Richard, plz!!

59
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:47,940
Anchor: It's okay regroup for a second. No problem. Go ahead take it again.

60
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,640
And here, when alllll hope is lost

When Frodo lost the Ring, when the Titanic sank, when that plane...

62
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,040
*record scratch*

63
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,540
No...

64
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,540
When all hope was lost

65
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,380
Richard

ONE. THOUSAND. PERCENT.

69
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,220
Richard: Okay

70
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:14,260
Richard: You're looking for someone who is more than just technology savvy

71
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,400
Pewds: Ja!

72
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,980
Richard: ...someone who has customer focus

73
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:24,960
and international experience. A prob—a person—who is a problem solver

74
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,520
Analytical yet still has common sense. [Pewds: Yes!]

75
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:32,160
I'm that person. [Pewds: He's that person.] I have great

76
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,280
...customer...

77
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,260
...focused skills [Pewds: He does!] and great soft skills.

78
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,299
I...have the ability to take

79
00:03:40,299 --> 00:03:43,180
end-to-end ownership of a project

80
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:48,040
And the determination to do whatever it takes to get the job done

81
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:48,600
Anchor: Fantastic, Richard.

82
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,840
*Pewds giggling incoherently*

83
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,640
It's so wholesome!

84
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,380
So glad he got through it! My man...

85
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:56,850
Richard! It's it's not a cringe. I just love the clip

86
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:04,900
You know that they're saying in a relationship what they're not doing in public they're doing at home. It's a bit more specific but

87
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:10,380
Great saying Felix. I know well this clip is a testimony of that and my god

88
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:14,650
It's probably one of the most painful fights I have ever seen on television

89
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:20,960
Thank You, mr. President, thank you. Good morning everyone and welcome to morning Joe Joe's back

90
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,100
Is here great to have you back?

91
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:31,560
We did lots of fighting over issues. So it should be a good show to know we do know. Oh, yeah, we don't fight

92
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,200
No, no. Don't do that, ok? Not on the air.

93
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,400
Not on the air! What're you doing, it's 6:03.

94
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,740
Well, can ask you a question?

95
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:43,010
Everyone knows you cannot hold hands at 6:03 (AM)

96
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:50,840
okay, you cannot do any endearing gesture at 6:03 (AM) touching hands you might as well given her a slap on the

97
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,920
nose

98
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:58,600
We're engaged I mean we've been engaged now for like 13 hours

99
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,040
(uhhhhh)

100
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,660
Do you think I should be able to hold her hand? (no, not at-)

101
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:11,810
603 not at 603 everyone knows that you'll be quiet. I'll hold your hand

102
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:17,830
My god, but there is a chance of hail in the morning after love eight will reach 13 - great

103
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:23,570
So pick the first day of the last month. Oh my god, I

104
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:29,480
Said this and I've said it before first of all never kiss anyone I mean, what's the point?

105
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:36,740
Don't kiss someone that isn't your girlfriend fiance or wife on camera at all. Just don't do it. Just don't do it

106
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:42,670
Just don't do it. Okay. Just don't kiss people. Just don't kiss anyone just don't want to kiss for this guy

107
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,240
It's like you know what?

108
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,240
Screw that rule.

109
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,860
I'm gonna go- i'm gonna- Im gon- *Gibberish*

110
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:51,960
'*+-. Moment of truth .-+*'

111
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,180
Woman: Ouuo.. Ahha,
Man: Hah, hahahahahaha!

112
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:56,040
Other man: Ok, this is going on.

113
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,240
Urruugh!

114
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,660
You had one job

115
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:04,440
Okay, you know how much shame I have to swallow for the handshake. What do you think?

116
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,760
I happen if I went into a kiss, huh? What would you think would happen?

117
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,120
Tehe, he hahahaha...

118
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:15,240
Okay, this really is great way or is it here yeah

119
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,840
He, hahahahah!

120
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:24,000
I'll just play it. Quarter o'clock. Yeah his phone rings and what is he doing?

121
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,180
*Throwing phone*

122
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,220
*Vietnamese*

123
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:36,000
Yeah, that's less awkward. Couldn't he have just muted it you didn't have to throw or chuck away your phone Jesus Christ

124
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,940
I love the sound

125
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:43,400
but

126
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,550
*Vietnamese*

127
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:53,930
Enjoy your broken phone and your lost job. Oh this one is this one is great to my man. Mike craft sick

128
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:57,020
He basically speaks just like I do

129
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,570
when it's unedited

130
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:02,000
if you ever want to know how an unedited pewdiepie video looks like

131
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:09,440
It's basically like this people trying to beat the heat and trying to stay cool and to tomorrow

132
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,680
and people

133
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,840
*Hard time speaking*

134
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:21,080
That's it guys hope you enjoy this video and to

135
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,530
Tomorrow

136
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:30,730
Don't get me wrong. Okay. I'm not ridiculing these people. I am merely celebrating it. We're a group of cringe.

137
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:37,730
We all know how it feels I love this clip because whatever she's saying it's just so goddamn

138
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:44,870
boring and this girl doing a copies in the background just realizes that she's

139
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:47,570
For the lottery starting tomorrow

140
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:52,040
Open until Friday the UAA will know

141
00:07:52,040 --> 00:08:00,980
Can I swap my cell phone picked up from Tuesday through Thursday now students which

142
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:06,920
Everyone is welcome to sign up live from the newsroom Cara Minelli. W UF t news

143
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:15,140
She's like what is happening? Beautiful cringe? Where would I be without you?

144
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:19,220
I'm so pale

145
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:21,340
Today snow is

146
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,420
low, and one of the

147
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,970
snow fell in Seattle in other areas

148
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:28,150
This is the kind of stuff that you know

149
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:32,650
I would if I do with this on camera Brad and Brad - we'll just draw attention to it

150
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:37,849
So now if I ever mess up an intro you normally I just keep going and do it redo it

151
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:41,560
But instead I have to stop the recording and start again

152
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,700
because of these douchebags

153
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:50,520
these meanies.

154
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:55,680
This clip is so weird, okay. If I no one has to context behind this, please feel free to let me know

155
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:01,320
I don't know. What the Frick her problem is. I feel like it's a broken record. Look at the best. I

156
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,090

159
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:15,839
It's not about the record this morning, but honestly, I feel like it was a broken record

160
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,720
this is like the best song I play that song I

161

So anyway, that's the best song ever. I really enjoy that. You got it daddy

163
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:33,420

164
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:38,700
literally, like &quot;Oh, thank you&quot;

165
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:44,520
Calling you daddy

166

This guy makes a weird furry joke and no one laughs

188
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:35,770
And it just makes it so much worse

189

I was wondering like surely Mo's rappers have some sort of hey, give us a freestyle

203
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:14,630
They just have like a go-to rhyme right? Maybe they're writing some song or something some material

204
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:19,670
That's what I would do if I had a rapper because I'm a but cuz I don't want to end up like Mike here

205
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:26,820
That's right. Everybody. I make an effort to not appear cringy. Here's like actual customer out here

212
00:13:56,730 --> 00:14:00,199
Humiliating. This is a new day. This is too big

213
00:14:00,199 --> 00:14:07,199
so basically they they came to rescue this hiker because they left a message in the sand and
