00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:10,570
[Music]

2
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:13,610
hey guys we just got back from the

3
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:17,750
Megalodon or rat knows me meg Meg but

4
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,930
you know what shut up Meg

5
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:22,070
that's what I thought of when I first

6
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:25,550
saw the logo but yeah it's uh basically

7
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:29,930
a dumb summer action flick starring

8
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:33,850
Jason Statham and a massive 70 foot

9
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:39,860
footlong Megalodon shark where he kung

10
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:47,660
fu kicks it in the face apparently as

11
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,820
badly as I wanted you just write a hint

12
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,879
and oh yeah he did whatever does get

13
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:55,370
pretty close to it and so what did you

14
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:58,160
guys think obviously this is kind of a

15
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,539
crazy idea

16
00:00:59,539 --> 00:01:03,519
so what did you think cheesy story

17
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:07,010
cheesy love interest

18
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:11,600
yeah yeah I dog it yeah I had fun with

19
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,020
this one

20
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,270
III thought it was dumb fun it was a

21
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:15,799
little bit better than I thought it

22
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:19,399
would be and it dictations when you hear

23
00:01:19,399 --> 00:01:20,689
something like this after hearing

24
00:01:20,689 --> 00:01:23,689
sharknado it's like I was a Meg you not

25
00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:26,180
expected much yeah I came in kind of

26
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,770
expecting the cheesy one I just wanted

27
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:29,930
to have fun with itself took a little

28
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:31,759
while to get started in that first act

29
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,350
other than the opening scene we got

30
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:35,960
Jason Statham sets him up as some Rescue

31
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,600
Diver expert which is actually a

32
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,579
sustained him in real life that's where

33
00:01:40,579 --> 00:01:43,039
he was known he was you know competitive

34
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:45,469
swimmer and divers so he really looks

35
00:01:45,469 --> 00:01:51,020
good in these scenes are you Joe no okay

36
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:53,479
you were gonna say so alright anyway so

37
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:55,880
yeah so he looks great in that and he's

38
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,740
doing this submarine a rescue at the

39
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,570
beginning of the film and he has a bit

40
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:02,509
of a brushin or an encounter which I

41
00:02:02,509 --> 00:02:03,890
don't know really fits in with the rest

42
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,570
of the film now that I think about the

43
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:08,060
plotline but it just kind of sets up he

44
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,039
has history with this creature and

45
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:12,620
there's a lot of these kinds of plot

46
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:16,160
contrivance ease and convenience is

47
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,750
rather andin tropes but you know you

48
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,640
have to kind of roll with the punches in

49
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,150
the film

50
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:26,390
it sets up this massive shark now I will

51
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:28,939
say that it's a lot larger film than it

52
00:02:28,939 --> 00:02:30,739
was a little bit more high budget than I

53
00:02:30,739 --> 00:02:32,599
was expecting I kind of was thinking

54
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:34,760
that you know we really wouldn't do a

55
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:38,269
lot of this underwater exploration and I

56
00:02:38,269 --> 00:02:40,159
really enjoyed those parts of the film

57
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:42,290
if you're a marine biologist if you're

58
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:50,930
into underwater dive and even like the

59
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:53,299
unknown like the ocean is so deep

60
00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:55,190
nobody knows what's down there I love

61
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:57,230
its kind like space yeah and so they're

62
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:59,120
going to go to the lowest point in the

63
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,799
ocean but apparently they said that's

64
00:03:00,799 --> 00:03:02,900
not really floor that's just like a

65
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,150
cloud it's a layer of gas a layer of

66
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:08,120
gases which you could penetrate and it

67
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,280
has some funny jokes in there and and

68
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,099
and then there's a whole new sort of you

69
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:16,970
know environment and ecosystem and

70
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:20,120
that's where we mean the Megalodon that

71
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,579
we've seen in the trailers and obviously

72
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:26,030
gets loose terrorizes little your keys

73
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:30,799
and the you know when people on the ox

74
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,900
and stuff and it was satisfying

75
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,370
I thought it was I thought I was

76
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:36,980
satisfied it was a stupid movie that

77
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:37,970
knew it was stupid

78
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:40,069
and so it's kind of we compared this a

79
00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:42,049
lot to kind of skyscraper right we're

80
00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:43,819
like skyscraper was a stupid movie that

81
00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:46,099
forgot to have fun yeah this was a movie

82
00:03:46,099 --> 00:03:47,780
that like it knew it was stupid it had a

83
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,430
lot of fun and you joked a lot and some

84
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,870
of the jokes didn't work but a lot of

85
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,069
them did and there's some like really

86
00:03:52,069 --> 00:03:54,650
funny parts now don't don't get us wrong

87
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:57,739
it wasn't like to the point where it was

88
00:03:57,739 --> 00:04:00,470
parroting itself it did take itself kind

89
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:03,109
of serious but it knew when to have

90
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:04,970
those moments of fun like Alex is saying

91
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:07,669
we're a skyscraper never had those this

92
00:04:07,669 --> 00:04:09,919
one does know when to have fun but it

93
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:11,389
was slow going in the beginning when

94
00:04:11,389 --> 00:04:13,549
they really tried to pull emotional

95
00:04:13,549 --> 00:04:16,789
heartstrings with this mother character

96
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:18,709
you've got this eight-year-old girl on

97
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:22,370
the ship and at first it just wasn't

98
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:25,159
working her father is the marine

99
00:04:25,159 --> 00:04:27,110
biologist researcher head of the station

100
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:31,010
you've got right Ryan's Wilson comes in

101
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:32,840
as the eccentric billionaire

102
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,600
who is funding this research station and

103
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,970
in the beginning of just I don't know I

104
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:39,860
don't know if it's the awkward dialogue

105
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:42,800
because it is an international film in

106
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,300
fact the logo at the beginning I think

107
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,520
is from a Chinese company so you could

108
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,620
tell that it that there's cross funding

109
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,600
here this was distributed by Warner

110
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,970
Brothers here in the States but I don't

111
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:54,919
know it had a little bit of sort of the

112
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:57,440
awkward dialogue but thankfully that

113
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,470
breaks later on and act 2 and act 3

114
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,630
where you know people were making some

115
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:05,030
good jokes and some funny jokes and and

116
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:07,160
I don't know what it is about one of my

117
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,360
favorite characters was the black guy

118
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,340
and it sucks because a lot of these

119
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,320
movies black guys always die first

120
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,240
you remember in deep blue sea or saying

121
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,639
oh that wasn't still Gabby that was a

122
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,889
shark right right because he comes out

123
00:05:18,889 --> 00:05:21,050
and gets killed right away and there's a

124
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:23,210
moment in this film where you think that

125
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:26,180
a lot of characters I was like it's

126
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,169
gonna happen again

127
00:05:27,169 --> 00:05:29,780
but please don't do this yeah and so no

128
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:32,360
spoil anything Joe but there's a lot of

129
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,840
really moments where the film plays with

130
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,419
your expectations and does it pay off

131
00:05:38,419 --> 00:05:41,300
doesn't it pay off and it's it's got

132
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,090
some some really nice twists in in that

133
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:46,990
sense but it could have been even more

134
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:49,130
self-aware and I think it would have

135
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:52,070
made it a stronger film as it was going

136
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,810
along with the climax how do you get a

137
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:57,740
climax with the 70-foot yeah a 75-foot

138
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,919
shark is Jason literally gonna kick him

139
00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:02,479
in the face because he's known for his

140
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,280
crime he's known for it so how do they

141
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,970
actually do this go do an evil wait a

142
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:11,810
spoiler okay yeah okay we can't you're

143
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:12,020
right

144
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:16,180
I was about to force you to spoiler okay

145
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:19,760
no there's a lot more underwater

146
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,460
exploration and submarines in this film

147
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,870
and that's what I was trying to get at

148
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:27,860
did I think that surprisingly this film

149
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:33,770
if it was done by say WB or who runs six

150
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:36,350
flat or not Six Flags but well Six Flags

151
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:38,330
could do it too but one of the you know

152
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:40,310
water parks this would probably make

153
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:43,190
kind of a good underwater ride or some

154
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:45,590
kind of motion ride as you're going

155
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:46,430
around

156
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,080
you're trying to escape from the

157
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,479
Megalodon you're going through with a

158
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,240
submarine these little areas and it's

159
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,130
it's tension-filled

160
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:58,550
it's beautiful visuals and it's great so

161
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,860
I was really surprised by Magnum don't

162
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:01,940
get me wrong it's stupid

163
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:04,280
it really is stupid and there's plot

164
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,169
points or you're like seriously why

165
00:07:06,169 --> 00:07:08,330
would you go in the water again or

166
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:11,090
people randomly fall out everyone all

167
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:13,250
out of the goddamn boat every single

168
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:16,039
character has their turn randomly

169
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:19,539
falling out of the boats I was so funny

170
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:22,220
but like I said we were willing to

171
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,830
forgive a lot of the film's stupidest

172
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:25,190
movies

173
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:28,460
I have several 11% I did not I did not

174
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:31,300
have any beers and I I thought it was

175
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,430
you know better than I expected you see

176
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:37,370
um what else this like I really liked

177
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:39,490
the eight year old girl I know she yeah

178
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:42,020
she was charming at first I thought she

179
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,160
was gonna be annoying and I was like

180
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,720
little girls don't talk like that but as

181
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,389
it went along she actually was pretty

182
00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:53,289
endearing and and I liked her character

183
00:07:53,289 --> 00:07:59,270
yellow creepy once but you'll have to

184
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,699
tell us in the spoilers okay so let's go

185
00:08:01,699 --> 00:08:03,440
ahead and give our final verdicts for

186
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,419
the Meg

187
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:08,840
let's inverse I'm inside okay okay I

188
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:13,430
decided this might be tugging on my my

189
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:16,820
shark string because I love sharks you

190
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,889
have a shark stranger Oh where's Evan I

191
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:21,260
told you I think one of my goals in life

192
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:24,020
is to go in a shark cage I want to do

193
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,180
them so bad and I've told you so you

194
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,190
like that scene where they have yes that

195
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,120
underwater

196
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,060
I love sharks everything about them this

197
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:34,640
was a cheesy movie though I've seen so

198
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,589
much worse but Disney village on I was

199
00:08:36,589 --> 00:08:38,930
entertained the entire time a little bit

200
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:40,700
is slow in the fur and like beginning

201
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:44,600
part but it picked up and it it was

202
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,339
great I was entertained I would give

203
00:08:46,339 --> 00:08:50,870
this a 6 yeah ah 6 as kind of a trashy

204
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,850
film where you're well you're out on the

205
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:55,550
water you're just enjoying it zarba

206
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,740
three years

207
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:59,680
you brought it down it was it's kind of

208
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,510
one of those yeah kind of one of those

209
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:05,890
you know dumb fun instead of dumb boring

210
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:08,050
like skyscrapers yeah what do you think

211
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:12,160
Alex six out of ten from Joel is

212
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,070
slightly but I if as long as I explain

213
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:16,930
that if we're lumping this in with all

214
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:18,970
the other summer blockbusters I would

215
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,680
also agree that this is a six I mean

216
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,149
well I'm not gonna compare this to like

217
00:09:22,149 --> 00:09:23,170
all of the grease what were you

218
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:25,390
considering lower I was thinking like

219
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,890
this is an average movie to compare it

220
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:28,209
to like all of the other movies of all

221
00:09:28,209 --> 00:09:29,470
time right like it's it kind of

222
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:33,130
somewhere yeah yeah of course you can't

223
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:34,720
compare it to Josh how do you think it

224
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,230
stacks up against jaws for me it has a

225
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:40,510
little bit less tension building a

226
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:44,740
little less sympathy towards the the MA

227
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,390
I thought that maybe they give the

228
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:49,089
injustice Ark is super evil but what I

229
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,500
was thinking that they would do with

230
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,510
this one since it's so you know ancient

231
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:54,640
and mysterious that they give it a

232
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,709
little bit more personality but know

233
00:09:56,709 --> 00:09:58,570
that this motherfucker at the same time

234
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:01,570
I like Josh because they like live stuff

235
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:06,940
around GI but how are you but but but

236
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,829
exactly how they did jaws with just a

237
00:10:08,829 --> 00:10:11,800
bigger no no you needed the jaws was

238
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,110
like look in this movie one of the

239
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,730
problems with this movies the shark is

240
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:18,610
constantly changing sizes like it's like

241
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:20,709
70 feet but then it they pull it up at

242
00:10:20,709 --> 00:10:23,110
like there's there's parts of the film

243
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:24,160
where you see it bite down on something

244
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,959
it's like that's like a 25-foot shark

245
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:28,060
that sharks like 150 feet now that

246
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:35,700
sharks not that shark 70/40 come on guys

247
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:39,220
it's 6 out of 10 for Alex and I'm gonna

248
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:41,290
agree I was while I was in the theater

249
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:44,890
and how satisfied I was with it and now

250
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:46,750
they do an ending that I'll talk about

251
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:49,450
in the spoilers that was a little okay

252
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:52,630
but so I'm gonna go I was gonna I was

253
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:55,510
creeping all the way up to a 7 but there

254
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:58,240
are some problems with the dialogue and

255
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,310
the first act of the film drags it down

256
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:02,529
when you get to that second act you get

257
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:04,660
the shark biting up on the you know

258
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,160
research station which you've seen in

259
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,140
the trailers you get some encounters

260
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,550
with submarines and

261
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:12,130
and then in that third act you get the

262
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,290
climax and I think it is a satisfying

263
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:16,390
climax well filmed with a bunch of

264
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:19,120
people you get your action there like

265
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,130
you were expecting like in Jaws

266
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:23,890
so it's satisfying that but because the

267
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:26,470
the dialogue is kind of poorly written

268
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:28,750
there were three writers on this project

269
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:31,410
and that probably was wise there were a

270
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:34,510
little bit of inconsistency and the

271
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:36,880
first a little slower and Jason does a

272
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,300
great job but you know he it's Jason me

273
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,370
and Jason and and he doesn't have kind

274
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:44,290
of the charm of some other ones but I

275
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:46,720
love Jays because he's so rugged and and

276
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,570
I love his action films I mean you could

277
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:51,880
have pretty much anybody do his role to

278
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,709
be perfectly honest he doesn't really

279
00:11:53,709 --> 00:11:57,040
add that special ingredient into it as

280
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,160
Jaws characters had but if you guys get

281
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,380
the job done so I am also gonna go with

282
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,930
the six out of ten now that's you would

283
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:06,610
think that's low but on my score its

284
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:08,589
above average and this one I'm actually

285
00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:10,660
gonna recommend you go out and see in

286
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,750
theaters if you're a fan of you know

287
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,520
marine biology if you're a fan of jaws

288
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,010
if you're a fan of the you know water

289
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:21,220
you know films so this is one of the

290
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:24,220
better ones bigger action budget but not

291
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,940
a lot of substance Joe alright actually

292
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:30,190
use another thing to know I thought Ruby

293
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:32,260
Rose is gonna play oh yeah bigger part

294
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,149
yeah I've got you didn't well they gave

295
00:12:34,149 --> 00:12:36,040
her an American accent for no reason

296
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,360
because like half the other people on

297
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,680
the ship have an Australian accents like

298
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,779
keep original accent because it sounds

299
00:12:40,779 --> 00:12:44,829
like she's yeah and that could have been

300
00:12:44,829 --> 00:12:46,270
one of the reasons why she barely has

301
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:48,279
any lines there's like no point in her

302
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:51,730
being in there so little bit so there

303
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,260
you go some of the supporting characters

304
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,760
weren't as strong as some of the

305
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,949
classics but alright guys so that's our

306
00:12:56,949 --> 00:12:58,660
opinion on the Megalodon but I still

307
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,760

00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:05,530
to bang my mom it's like this is cocaine

329
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:08,260
at is that's written for her book I know

330
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,180
I get it all it's being all the things

331
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:13,150
but she's the cute ass a little kid and

332
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,710
she really made me laugh a lot

333
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:18,300
and when the black guys freaking out

334
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:22,020
[Applause]

335
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:25,390
she's like oh my gosh she's the best and

336
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:28,060
then so they used submarines essentially

337
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:33,190
to lure the Megalodon way through but

338
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:35,020
there there were two Megalodon

339
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,700
so that's why I wanted to speak up when

340
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,780
you guys were talking about size

341
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,610
inconsistencies because there's a small

342
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:42,130
last mag mode on that's the one that was

343
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:43,900
doing all the small bites and there's a

344
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:46,840
big-ass no not when Rainn Wilson was by

345
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,750
the will cuz he okay he's all scared

346
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:52,900
yeah the bigger one cuz my bite see like

347
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,400
because a little absorb into an

348
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,080
advantage okay so let me let me preface

349
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,630
this the film does a good job and I

350
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:00,010
mentioned forget fail to mention this in

351
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:01,750
the review of kind of explaining those

352
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,310
little things that you wish they would

353
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:04,930
explain in movies like oh come on don't

354
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:07,150
continue to fight it you know and then

355
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,470
that black guy again was like nah man

356
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:10,540
we're damn right I mean we're done with

357
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:13,300
this cuz Ryan is like Ryan's character

358
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,490
it's like I was ordered to Rainn Wilson

359
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:19,090
sorry brings two destroyers told the

360
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:21,070
Australian govern the Chinese government

361
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:22,690
Philippines it's all gonna be taken care

362
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,670
of and we're just leaving but he lied

363
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:26,200
because he didn't want any legal

364
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,000
liability so he tries to go out there

365
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,460
with one helicopter one black ops boat

366
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:37,540
and like usually the guys know stuff

367
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:40,090
this use these debt charts or depth

368
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:42,280
charge or whatever to destroy their the

369
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,990
Research Center I was like oh shit oh

370
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:49,600
yeah they were trying to do it but like

371
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,040
no but he's a nice guy

372
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,050
thankfully they didn't do that trope and

373
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:54,730
I was like okay and then once they

374
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:57,940
killed it you know at one point they'd

375
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,590
pull it on to the boat and I'm like wait

376
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:02,620
that doesn't look like it raises great

377
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:06,940
white sizes okay so the 30 feet instead

378
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,520
of 70 right but they had just shown this

379
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,530
research that they're supposed to be 75

380
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:13,900
feet long and nobody freakin notices

381
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:19,650
this yeah okay so fine

382
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:24,360
no so the use subs and these uh

383
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,060
torpedoes to try to blow it up and

384
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:31,030
Jason's submarine gets damaged and

385
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:33,040
that's when he's going on these

386
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,200
underwater maneuvers and I was like man

387
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,090
this would be a great fucking ride and

388
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:39,300
the islands of adventure Florida

389
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,440
spraying water in your face like that

390
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,210
thing and you know they could do it

391
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,040
because they have curb screens and stuff

392
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,450
and a lot of these submarines have

393
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:48,670
bubbles and they could spray water like

394
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:52,090
oh shit it would be freaking awesome so

395
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:55,420
but anyway you know he eventually uses

396
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:58,570
the submarine to cut the belly of the

397
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:00,730
Megalodon to make it bleed first but

398
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:02,290
that doesn't kill it and then he was

399
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:04,690
gonna commit suicide by ramming his sub

400
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,540
into the Megalodon with the torpedo cuz

401
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:10,990
the torpedo jammed right and instead he

402
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:13,060
gets out and grab something sharp and

403
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:16,090
starts stabbing the Megalodon yeah in

404
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:18,850
the on the eye and then amaz great shot

405
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:20,290
of him boat coming out of the water and

406
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:22,330
then falling out of the water yeah pops

407
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:25,060
up he pushes it further into the eye

408
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,910
yeah yeah well I was hoping he'd kick it

409
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:29,440
and because the whole thing I when I

410
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,760
walked in the theater I'm one of the

411
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,340
karate kick it he comes so very close

412
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,690
because there's a moment where he gets

413
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:37,060
in the water with it just bared the

414
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,950
smaller Megalodon where they're like we

415
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:41,620
need to track it and and so he has to

416
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,940
get within a 100 feet

417
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,980
fire off the tracker on its fan why

418
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:48,550
would it stay surfaced for this shit but

419
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:50,350
the movie has a lot of those kinds of

420
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:52,240
things like you know it's a good read a

421
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,770
good thing that he was within two hours

422
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:55,900
of you know the South China Sea where

423
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,030
they were like Jason Statham just

424
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:00,610
happens to live in Thailand yeah and and

425
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:04,120
also his wife his ex-wife happens to be

426
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,790
the original sub palette who

427
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:09,280
a the megalith once they penetrate this

428
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,110
new area the Megalodon Rams the ship and

429
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,970
he goes down there to rescue him turns

430
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:14,470
out he's the guy that rescues his

431
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:16,930
ex-wife the doctor on board is the one

432
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:19,030
that he rescued five years earlier and

433
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,680
it's just kinda yeah it's kind of sad a

434
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,500
convenience in there where this doctor

435
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,420
didn't believe that of him about the

436
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:27,160
monster but then obviously he eats his

437
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,250
words and gets eaten drink some drinks a

438
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:36,940
beer get over yeah okay and I like kind

439
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:39,430
of like that they you so the love

440
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:43,390
interest I did but cheesy but I didn't

441
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:45,310
hate it yeah I like that all of his

442
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:47,020
friends including his ex-wife we're kind

443
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:49,060
of like growling for him yeah you don't

444
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,370
see that very often in films cuz you

445
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:52,990
would think oh if they're gonna bring

446
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:54,820
these two and they just so happy to be

447
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,590
in the same place any any rescues heard

448
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:57,850
that they're gonna get back together

449
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:00,340
especially when she's hurt and he wants

450
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,930
to you know because she gets hurt inside

451
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:03,550
the semi but they're not gonna do them

452
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:05,620
but no it's not you don't wonder they

453
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,300
just don't work out there too you know

454
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,430
we even said that it's like all these

455
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:13,630
guys yeah and so it opened the door for

456
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:17,770
the the daughter character to you know

457
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:21,580
just randomly walk into his area and see

458
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:25,750
all his hairy pecs and shit from you

459
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,970
didn't even notice she walks in and he

460
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,320
is just getting out of the shower and he

461
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,760
only has a towel and then I was like

462
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,620
okay are they gonna try to do a love

463
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:36,280
interesting they did and they did it

464
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,810
respectfully it's not like they make out

465
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:39,880
at the end or anything like that it's

466
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,890
it's really the daughter trying to get

467
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,900
her mom laid this whole time she's eight

468
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,790
years old so I don't think that really

469
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:47,920
yeah what happened that day prize

470
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,710
there's no guess yeah well it was a

471
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:52,180
weird thing because like her mom had

472
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,890
died that day but then like got revived

473
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:55,690
her grandfather had died like the day

474
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:57,970
before and right it was probably would

475
00:19:57,970 --> 00:19:59,740
have been it was inappropriate with the

476
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,990
kiss but it was a woman I would have

477
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:04,750
been fine with it but I was surprised

478
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:07,030
they shown restraint so um what about

479
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,950
the fact that it was a Chinese film and

480
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:10,630
they had main characters that were

481
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:14,070
speaking Chinese to each other just 100%

482
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:16,330
integrated in the film not brought

483
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:17,270
attention to

484
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:18,440
a problem with it like it's got

485
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,970
something that like people the American

486
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:21,050
honest you're gonna have to get used to

487
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:22,460
because this can happen more and more I

488
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,230
mean like I've seen I've been seeing

489
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:26,420
more and more logos in front of films

490
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:29,240
with Chinese characters I mean that they

491
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,550
want they want these big movies and it

492
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:33,470
may it's easier for the cuz they only

493
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:35,540
get something like ten movies and so if

494
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:38,090
like as far as like American movies I

495
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:39,350
think only a certain number of movies

496
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:41,560
get to be brought over and so as

497
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,210
skyscrapers is amazing over there yeah

498
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:46,670
really well and so we're gonna see more

499
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:47,900
and more but I think if they did it

500
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:48,890
pretty seamlessly they're gonna have a

501
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:50,180
problem with any other dive I think it's

502
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:52,640
great I like this whole thing too you

503
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,920
know the thing is that I don't know if

504
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,780
there's an American company would give

505
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:59,330
them that big of a budget in order to

506
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:01,100
you know make a film like this so the

507
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,570
fact that it got made and was slightly

508
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:04,520
above average I appreciate it I think

509
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,290
this was better than the Great Wall you

510
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:07,760
know when Matt Damon so if they're doing

511
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,690
stuff like this

512
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:18,920
Oh what damn Joe that's a hard a shit so

513
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:26,120
i have soured so much i think i don't

514
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,280
know we gave it like a seven or a six

515
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:31,490
six six seven did I yeah no I don't I

516
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:33,920
don't know but after we made our videos

517
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,140
that has to be a completely separate

518
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:39,200
issue so you guys drunk all right we're

519
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,270
done thank you so much for what was

520
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:43,880
there anything else I loved that he was

521
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,050
swimming in there and he was like

522
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:46,310
worried about the shark and he kept

523
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:48,470
saying just keep swimming just keep

524
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:50,270
swimming like it was there's a lot of

525
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:51,560
like little bits of humor there that

526
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:55,790
from from Finding Nemo oh right what

527
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:57,830
he's when he's butt-naked well he's not

528
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:02,900
but maybe but he's not okay so I'm naked

529
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:06,140
in this movie so you wanna he's he's

530
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:09,050
hairy it's completely exposed to the

531
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:11,630
shark is what I'm trying to say in a

532
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:12,470
creative way

533
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:14,540

534
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:16,160
language of trying to spice up our

535
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:19,130
reviews anyways so he's swimming naked

536

00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:23,630
shark and stab it in the eye all right
