1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:04,660
And a picture of Sidney Poitier by the bed, okay

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:11,849
And we offer two double beds separated or a queen bed. I'm assuming y'all would want the queen bed since

3
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:15,440
(Laughter)

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:31,180
We're not a couple this is a business trip, we're keeping it very professional what separate yes professional professional professional

5
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:32,080
Every

6
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:32,580
Hotel

7
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:37,440
Ever

8
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,210
Dude I'm so afraid to touch anything in hotel rooms

9
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:44,850
Hey, don't people use those black light things to see how dirty a hotel room is? well It's funny

10
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,530
You should say that because yes, they do, let's see what we're working with. Oh, I don't think you want to do that

11
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:53,640
It's not necessary. All right, we're going for it cool

12
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,240
It's a lot cleaner than i anticipated, don't you think

13
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:57,960
What the f-

14
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,040
 

15
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:03,200
Why are these towels crunchy?

16
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,480
C'mon, we're gonna miss the free breakfast

17
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:11,860
Excuse me, where's the complimentary breakfast? Oh, it's in the breakfast hall to your left

18
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:17,100
But you guys already missed it, sorry. Wait, but it's at 5 a.m to 6 a.m.

19
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,530
Free breakfast.

20
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:19,960
That is correct

21
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:24,119
However, that is only for Gold Card members, you guys are regular guests

22
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:27,520
Which means breakfast goes from 2 a.m to

23
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,740
2:15 a.m. With proof they've slept for at least three hours

24
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:35,619
Who has proof that they slept?

25
00:01:35,619 --> 00:01:38,860
Who doesn't?

26
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:44,950
Are you a real doctor? No, but I did stay at a Holiday Inn Express last night

27
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:46,570
Oh

28
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:52,049
Finally some time from the kids. You know, it's crazy, we're literally paying good money to be away from our children

29
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:57,220
Yeah, we're essentially paying for sex which is technically prostitution

30
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:57,720
Hmm

31
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,820
I feel weird about it now.

32
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,640
As you should

33
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,360
Freeze. Don't move

34
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:12,550
You're under arrest for the solicitation of prostitution. What I thought you were my wife. You thought wrong, scum

35
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:16,470
But I loved you! you love wrong, dirtbag!

36
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,370
We have children together

37
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:21,069
Guess again, pervert

38
00:02:21,069 --> 00:02:24,960
Sarah? Bradley?

39
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:30,520
You disgust me sicko. You're going away for a long time DAD

40
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:39,300
(Laughter)

41
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,520
(Laughter) Noooo

42
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,220
Hotel

43
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:42,940
Motel

44
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,480
Holiday inn

45
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,620
Can't believe you spent $800 for three nights in this crappy hotel room.

46
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:52,129
Oh Don't worry, I got this. See I figured out a way to recoup our costs

47
00:02:52,129 --> 00:02:57,889
Shampoo conditioner? Yeah, I figure we spend, what? Ballpark big year rounding down roughly

48
00:02:57,889 --> 00:03:01,939
$4,000 a month on shampoo and conditioner, and this will get us through the next three weeks

49
00:03:01,939 --> 00:03:10,360
So we spend one week a month at a hotel, cutting our costs in half

50
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:17,000
You're a f***ing genius

51
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,320
Should get those, cuz we don't know if those two go to waste.

52
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,660
I want to rent this movie for $26.99

53
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:30,480
Man, I'm starving, should we just order room service? imagine how expensive that'll be. Lets just door dine. Door dine? Yeah

54
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:42,220
It's where you eat other people's room service. Oh, that sounds good. Leftovers, you eat other people's leftovers. It's mostly ketchup napkins

55
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:48,880
(Hiss)

56
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:53,760
No running in the lobby

57
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,400
(beep)

58
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,620

59
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:03,320

60
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:09,780

61
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,960
(beep)

62
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:17,780
Damnit

63
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:20,080
(beep)

64
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,080
(beep)

65
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:29,100
(laughing)

66
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:38,470
He only lasted two minutes, I win. I thought he had more in him. Well alright now whose key card you gonna deactivate now?

67
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:40,470
Double or nothing all the same guy?

68
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:43,660
Oh its on!
