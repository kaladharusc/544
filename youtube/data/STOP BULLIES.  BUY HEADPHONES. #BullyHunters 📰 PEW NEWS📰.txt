00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:06,140
I'm Gloria Borger and you're watching PewNews :3

2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:16,860
*PAPAPAPA*

3
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:24,880
Good evening! I'm Gloria Borger today. We have a lot of news to discuss, so let's just stop

4
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,100
anyyway our first story comes from Johnny Dee, luckily

5
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:34,750
As we reported last week Johnny D. Was hospitalized because he suffered from Noumea, Pneu

6
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:42,969
NoumÃ©a pneumonia johnny is now back. He's looking better and he made a response video. They do not choose to show yourself on YouTube

7
00:00:42,969 --> 00:00:48,820
Like I do.They're very good. I wish I was as good as them. If you come to my town, I'll show you where to go

8
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:54,900
I'll show you we can see, the best rappers, the best singers in this city

9
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:55,700
This is so sweet

10
00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:03,100
He will show you if you're in his town Johnny D invites you to show his favorite rapper it's wonderful to see

11
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:09,140
First of all how much support you guys sent to the GoFundMe page it hit the goal

12
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:12,420
$15,000 an amazing effort good job everyone

13
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,640
I'm really proud to see how empathetic and heartwarming and

14
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:23,290
This community of Squad fam can be and it's really nice to see Johnny D. Just genuinely being grateful in return

15
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:27,070
Next news this week a female empowerment

16
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:33,479
Movement was announced and it's called bully hunters and as soon as I heard about bully hunter initiative

17
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:38,020
I thought to myself there is just no way this could go wrong

18
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:43,090
Whatsoever this is not gonna end up like another train wreck

19
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:44,920
How is this real?

20
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:49,530
2018 is just wonderful, it just keeps on giving so the idea behind bully hunters

21
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:50,170
is that uh,

22
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:53,200
to stop harassment in games,

23
00:01:53,200 --> 00:02:00,570
specifically Counter Strike or CS GO, you can call upon a bully hunter that will then join your game and kill the bully in the

24
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:06,659
game.They display this in the most hilariously awkward and most scripted way I've ever seen. Now our bully

25
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:11,150
Hunter has asked &quot;therosethorn&quot; live in game, who is harassing her and our victim

26
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:15,480
Then immediately replied. Let's zoom in again on the bottom left-hand corner.

27
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:20,340
Now you see there, the tool connected these two, a victim with a bully hunter

28
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:25,760
Okay, so now &quot;Bully Hunter_77&quot; knows the name of the harasser, and she is ready to take action. Now

29
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,700
We are going to switch over to BULLY HUNTER_77's screen

30
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,200
to watch the hunt,

31
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,880
cut to that feed, please and play it.

32
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:38,910
So we are watching our bully hunter. She knows who the harasser is and she's on the hunt

33
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:42,800
You can still hear the harassment in the background, it doesn't stop

34
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:50,850
So now, BULLY HUNTER_77 is looking for the harasser, and it looks like she's going to use her knife and there it is, just pause right there

35
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:53,900
Let's back up and see that again.

36
00:02:53,900 --> 00:03:03,239
A brilliant knife move, very difficult, that's right knifing someone back in cs:go while they're standing still or probably have left their computer

37
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:07,910
It's one of the most difficult moves of all time. This is supposed to stop harassment everyone

38
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:10,470
This is what their idea even if this wasn't

39
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:17,430
Completely fake and staged it's still a terrible idea. See in the lower left hand corner. Let's pause that and zoom into that

40
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:28,290
Our bully hunter left the calling card message to the harasser harassment is not a game bully org

41
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:31,500
We sure showed him everyone

42
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,920
Loved the music that they added, hahaha

43
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:44,370
We've been waving text from the bullies the harassment has been taken care of

44
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,620
This is our casual gamer

45
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:51,950
Pink light 23 who has been harassed in game a pink like 23 what you're gonna

46
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:57,060
Do is you're gonna sit here and play Counter Strike and when the light shows at you?

47
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:02,130
That means you've been harassed so be sure to maybe show some sort of emotion

48
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:07,100
You can cry if you want to now. Let's see how she used our global tool to call a bully hunter

49
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:14,579
They have an audience reacting to it. Do they not understand that this illegitimate is their whole point

50
00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:17,790
If their goal is to show that harassment is real

51
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:21,160
And which I'm not denying by the way they just create the off

52
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,980
That if fake now if you're not for some reason surely. This is fake

53
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:31,180
Basically they even discovered that bully hunter 77 is the same person that was being bullied

54
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:37,550
they literally just changed the name on this team profile, which you can see by looking at them and

55
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:39,920
It's just so laughably bad

56
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,890
It reminds me of so many times

57
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:43,250
I work with agencies

58
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:49,270
But especially back in the past where they are just so extremely tone-deaf to what is a good idea

59
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:54,560
And what is not a good idea because they never actually made anything online, so they don't know how?

60
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,260
people are going to perceive these sort of things and

61
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:02,090
This is just one of those ideas that for some reason no one said no to

62
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:05,060
steal serious which one of the brands that was involved and

63
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:11,450
when they got call out on all of this their response was if the only thing that comes of this is a

64
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:17,780
Conversation around the topic then we feel it is still a step in the right direction

65
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:20,680
Stop we need to I'm tired of hearing this argument

66
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,680
If only we did one step for women

67
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:30,250
Then it's a step that is worth taking no okay. You did more harm than good here clearly

68
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:34,180
This is so idiotic that no one is going to take harassment seriously

69
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:41,480
That's how stupid it is so don't pretend that you took a step forward. This is taking a step back and for what selling headphones

70
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:45,440
Great fantastic initiative you got there wait

71
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:52,940
Companies need to stop using charity as some sort of ploy to seem as good moral beings you're not you're just morons

72
00:05:52,940 --> 00:06:00,290
Everyone involved with this is immoral proceeds from this will go to support victims of harassment in gaming

73
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:03,260
What does that mean?

74
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:08,540
Who-who who could that possibly go to I

75
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:13,810
Have a victim of harassment in gaming okay, can I please have some of the SteelSeries money?

76
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:20,600
I I could really use this one of the hosts involved the tweeted out that it was never supposed to be taken as

77
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:28,210
Happening live. Here's the script. Oh, okay, so because you shared the script that means all the sudden that

78
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:33,420
It wasn't supposed to be scripted right oh my god. I can't begin to count the hours

79
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:39,790
I've spent gaming online in that time. I have seen every imaginable sort of harassment and threatening language

80
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:46,450
And yes, I have even used some of that language myself

81
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:49,590
No, no you can't play the victim card

82
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:53,040
You're just being criticized like everyone else can be on the Internet

83
00:06:53,040 --> 00:07:00,600
We need to stop giving away pity as a currency to these people they literally feed off it

84
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:07,050
You're being criticized just because some people are being rude online doesn't make the fact that you messed up any less, okay?

85
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,820
No, no one deserves to be harassed

86
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,980
I'm not ignoring that that's the thing I've seen videos of

87
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:16,950
Other twitch streamers that probably would have been more appropriate to have hosting this event by the way

88
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:23,800
Yes, it is a problem. This certainly doesn't fix it, but hilarious nonetheless I

89
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:29,760
Tell you guys ass is coming out on Nintendo's switch, I check it out link it or skip you

90
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:33,940
You know you don't want to miss this. This is a game of the year everyone

91
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:41,950
Our next story comes from Eppie Faria Twitter user so I'm watching Peter pie on YouTube because I'm trash no no no

92
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:44,919
Don't self-deprecating right you're an intellectual

93
00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:45,660
nothing less

94
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:51,220
I'm greeted with an ADD of dancing chick titled hot girl 2018 and this thumbnail

95
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:57,060
What we're of course going to censor this there's no way I would ever show something this bad on my channel

96
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:01,419
I want everyone that watches my videos to feel safe at all times

97
00:08:01,419 --> 00:08:03,160
so

98
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:10,120
We will censor this of course. I feel like it for years now. I play this game with YouTube or everyone where

99
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:16,140
It's it's as okay, so if you want mid-roll ads you're gonna have to make the video ten minutes

100
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,240
That's just a rule okay fine

101
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:18,990
All right

102
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:27,550
If you want any sort of decent ads make sure or none age restriction make sure you don't swear and use the explicit language

103
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:36,769
Fine okay sure I also make sure you don't have any explicit content jokes or a controversial topic okay fine

104
00:08:36,769 --> 00:08:39,169
Okay great here is your head

105
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:41,120
It's straight up pork

106
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:48,250
Thank you. Thank you so much now. I noticed my CPM dropping a few weeks ago, and I try to understand why this happened

107
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:53,709
That's why I especially try to really cut down on swearing and this sort of thing hasn't done anything at all

108
00:08:53,709 --> 00:08:58,600
And then you see these ads show show up, and it's it's pretty damn frustrating

109
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,399
It really feels like I slap in the face

110
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:06,160
YouTube's responded and took down this ad very quickly which I commend him for thank you for doing that but there was the same thing

111
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:11,750
Going on last week there was like a Vigano in one of my thumbnails of an ad and it's just like why

112
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:18,290
How is this happening how far is this gonna stretch? How far is this gonna go anyway next news everybody

113
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:21,940
Our last news come from Jacques himself that's right. He's back

114
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:28,850
He had to testify in front of the Congress you probably saw this because of privacy issues and concerns and those are of course

115
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:30,170
important topics to discuss

116
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:36,920
but I wanted to focus on some other questions that came up through this that I found a lot more interesting enticing with what we

117
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:41,540
Talked about earlier here, which is harassment or hate speech rather

118
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,890
Zuckerberg was

119
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:48,980
Asked to define hate speech for example senator. I think that this is a really hard question

120
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:56,089
And I think it's one of the reasons why we struggle with it. I'm worried about the psychological categories around speech

121
00:09:56,089 --> 00:09:59,110
40% of Americans under age 35 tell pollsters

122
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:01,310
They think the First Amendment is dangerous

123
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:07,220
Because you might use your freedom to say something that hurts somebody else's feelings as we as we were able to

124
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:10,550
technologically shift especially having AI

125
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,399
proactively look at content

126
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,269
I think that that's gonna

127
00:10:14,269 --> 00:10:22,640
Create massive questions for society about what obligations we want to require companies to yeah, you're right Zucc

128
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,110
the AI

129
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:25,970
determination of what's

130
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:30,070
Harmful content has really worked out really well as here over on YouTube

131
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:35,140
But so I don't see any problem with that their social media platforms are not neutral platforms

132
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:41,500
But bear some responsibility for the content. I agree that we're responsible for the content

133
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,990
Previously, It's been up in the air whether Facebook is a neutral

134
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:52,190
platform or if they are responsible for the content and to admit this it sort of changed is the whole dynamic of the.. things

135
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:57,220
Obviously, they're a private company. They're free to do whatever they want if they want to censor content

136
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:00,760
They are open to do so but previously it hasn't really been clear

137
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:07,090
Are you a free platform, or do you censor content, or do you shape or control?

138
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:08,530
What's posted on your site?

139
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:14,570
And is this is same sort of struggle that's going on here on YouTube where whether YouTube want it to be or not they are

140
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:18,560
Responsible for what's on their website. It's an interesting question to me

141
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:23,990
Because now that you have these massive companies like Google and Facebook

142
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:28,730
controlling such massive means of communication and important means of communication

143
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:33,430
It's is it within their right to censor that communication, or do they even have to do

144
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:38,120
It are they they've sort of forced into a corner to do it we see a lot of ideas being

145
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:42,560
Censored on YouTube and Facebook because they're not popular with the media

146
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:48,850
They have such a massive control over what sort of ideas are acceptable and not and that to me is a lot scarier than this

147
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:52,460
Whole issue with privacy that apparently this

148
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:58,520
Meeting was all about and if this continues in the future who knows what kind of implications it will have

149
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,770
That was it for this week's PewNews

150
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:07,940
Hope you enjoyed this video and their many ads that she was shown many great if you didn't have any ads, please

151
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,620
consider buying a mug

152
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:14,320
It would really help me out a lot, a PewNews Mug check out the link in the description

153
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:22,430
I am Gloria Borger, and this is me signing off

154
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:29,000
Now that's what this is all about removing harassment from gaming harassment has no place here
