throughout history mankind has faced

00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,790
challenges far and wide building the

00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,360
escaping our own atmosphere to brave the

perilous journey to the infinite but

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,500
there are some challenges that were just

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,750
never meant to be faced some peaks to

11
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,960
monumental some chasms to great this

12
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,300
bravery and then that's just plain

13
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,460
stupidity but mankind doesn't get

no one else wants to and that's why I'm

17
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,610
going where no man has ever gone before

18
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,979
and come back to tell the tale mission

00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,619
yeah here that one time this one time

26
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:23,940
was all he needed

27
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,830
after that the seafloor split open and

28
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,320
swallow the Caribbean earthquakes ravage

35
00:01:41,489 --> 00:01:43,709
so when Taito corporation asked him to

36
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:45,239
lend his name to their new video game

37
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:47,250
instead of simply saying yes and taking

38
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,810
the money he chose to be directly

39
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,429
involved with the creation of the game

40
00:01:50,429 --> 00:01:52,229
he even starred in two Japanese

41
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:53,940
commercials advertising the game

42
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,709
perplexingly enough both of these

43
00:01:55,709 --> 00:01:57,539
commercials were actually cryptic hints

44
00:01:57,539 --> 00:01:59,160
on how to complete difficult parts of

45
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,819
the game and then this I can't provide

would you mind into there feel the pain

62
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:47,790
feel the anger that first time I just

63
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,290
want to say there's a password guard in

64
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:50,849
front of this password screen here and

65
00:02:50,849 --> 00:02:52,470
you can just punch him and get a game

66
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:55,290
over before you even play the game game

67
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:57,030
over I think there has to be a game

68
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,890
first for it to be over maybe they're

69

talking about the game of life

00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,980
the game opens up with you getting

71
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,709
yelled at in your boss's office

72
00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:06,120
literally you don't even get fired it's

73
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,379
not concrete you're just being

74
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:09,599
reprimanded for your mediocrity oh yeah

75
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,010
you're gonna yell at me well this is a

76
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:12,720
video game I can do what I want

Oh Merry Christmas Japan 1918 why would

78
00:03:19,859 --> 00:03:21,900
I try to escape real life by playing a

79
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,790
game that's more depressing than real

80
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:25,440
life am I supposed to feel good by

81
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,660
comparison well at the very least I can

82
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,370
say this game was innovative for its

83
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,260
time it's open-ended and has heavy

84
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,510
real-life themes which most concurrent

85
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:35,340
games had little of if any but perhaps

86
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,220
it's a bit too open-ended where am I

87
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,410
supposed to go the bank the Culture Club

88
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:44,489
grilled morbid Mormons was gone I don't

89
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:47,250
know is all right eat those guys that

90
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,030
better should check the bro

91
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:52,550
okay well I already have no idea what to

92
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:54,320
do so I guess I'll do what I always do

93
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,130
when I'm lost

94
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:56,980
drink heavily but lots of drinks wait

95
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:59,330
absolutely above the margin of necessary

96
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:07,930
mom is scared huh it's pitch black

97
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,770
wait where am I

98
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:11,690
this woman beating up on me what's going

99
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:17,209
on my home well this explains quite a

100
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:18,830
bit so you talked to your wife and your

101
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:22,190
options are food a bath let's go to bed

102
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:25,090
I want to travel and I want a divorce

103
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:28,430
this is a video game from the 80s keep

104
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:30,470
in mind at this point most games look

105
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,330
like this or are this

106
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,100
they didn't usually have themes of

107
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,960
domestic conflict in them

108
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,850
and they still don't really let's give

109
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:39,680
her the good ol one to divorce and see

110
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,330
what happens him after all she is

111
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:48,830
violent so you can pay alimony or

112
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:52,620
punch you know whenever I find myself in

113
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,270
this situation I find that pay alimony

114
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,640
works out far smoother in the long run

115
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,830
but there is no denying that a punch is

116
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,930
a much more satisfying short term

117
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:02,550
solution also I just like to point out

118
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:04,110
that there is a licensed Nintendo game

119
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:06,120
with domestic violence that you can

120
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,840
literally murder your wife and literally

121
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,850
murder your children I think I need to

122
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:14,160
repeat that literally murder your

123
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,980
children if the walls could talk they'd

124
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:19,620
say really bad things about that guy now

125
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,970
this is the point where most people like

126
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:27,480
99% of people would do this out of this

127
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,510
house out of this house spirits be gone

128
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:33,150
from this house but this is in most

129
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:34,380

131
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:42,960
this is jontron to take on this

132
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,820
challenge I have to think like a

133
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:49,410
salaryman dress like 1v1 let's beat

134

Takeshi at his own game god dammit you

135
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:55,080
are not gonna believe this this game

136
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,570
requires an insane amount of trial and

137
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,669
error more than any sane person would be

138
00:05:59,669 --> 00:06:01,710
expected to undertake for starters

139
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:03,570
you're supposed to ignore your boss at

140
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:04,620
the beginning of the game because you

141
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,150
want to pick up the bonus he gives you

142
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:08,460
later so you go directly to the bank and

143
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,810
close out your account to withdraw the

144
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:12,150
50000 yen that are in there then you go

145
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:14,340
to the local culture club and use the

146
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:18,150
money to buy shamisen lessons yeah it

147
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:20,550
sounds random right but you're supposed

148
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:22,380
to do this cuz you actually have to

149
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,790
start the game out by divorcing your

150
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,530
wife and when you do that you have to

151
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:28,740
pay her alimony and that means that 75%

152
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,450
of the money that you're holding on to

153
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:32,190
at that given moment will go to her and

154
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:34,080
you need the money later or else you'll

155
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,970
get stuck you won't be able to beat the

156
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,650
game so basically you're trying to give

157
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:39,330
your wife as little money as possible

158

159

the next steps are entirely steps made

160
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:46,620
of logic wit job take money out of the

161

office plant learn to hang glide all the

162
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,200
while managing to dodge yonkers at Tufts

163
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,520
that are trying to beat the shit out of

164

you as you moon jump past and by the way

165
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:58,410
they're unavoidable it doesn't matter

166
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:00,200
how hard you try unless you get lucky

167

10% of a time they'll teleport to you

168
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:04,800
and take a hit now normally in a video

169
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,900
game this wouldn't be a problem but for

170
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,460
a majority of the time in this game you

171
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,260
can't replenish your hearts and you only

172
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:13,289
have four which is not a lot trust me

173
00:07:13,289 --> 00:07:15,300
it's like the yuccas are just a tax at

174
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,580
all every time you pass one they take a

175
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,690
part of you with them

176
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:20,669
the more you play the game the more you

177
00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:22,530
run the meter better use your time

178
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:23,520
wisely

179
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,830
she's an allegory it's just an allegory

180
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,389
of our inevitable demise I'm slowly

181
00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:29,430
dying I'm slowly dying just like him

182
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:31,320
each obstacle makes an etching in my

183
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,650
soul now this may seem very cryptic and

184
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:36,240
convoluted but that's because you

185
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,099
haven't heard the next part you're then

186
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:39,990
supposed to go to the pachinko parlor

187
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:42,960
and buy 500 balls and lose them

188
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,330
sir you don't have enough balls okay

189
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:48,300
okay first off rude but secondly yes I

190
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,639
fucking do because they won't go down I

191
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,860
keep winning balls you know one time I

192
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,750
want to lose it gambling and I can't do

193
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,090
it if I tried I don't know for sure what

194
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:58,440
hell looks like but I think it might be

195
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,660
a bit like takeshi's challenge this is

196
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:04,279
ridiculous

197
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:14,269
shut up you dick you're supposed to be

198
00:08:14,269 --> 00:08:17,329
supposed to yell into the microphone on

199
00:08:17,329 --> 00:08:22,939
the second controller a bunch of Yakuza

200
00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:24,919
toughs fill into the parlor and to beat

201
00:08:24,919 --> 00:08:26,449
this part you have to knock out at least

202
00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:27,949
one of them which is really hard cuz

203
00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:29,479
they all three pummel onto you really

204
00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:31,699
quickly and you die in seconds oh and

205
00:08:31,699 --> 00:08:34,310
did I mention any time you die in this

206
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:36,829
game you have to go to the beginning and

207
00:08:36,829 --> 00:08:39,800
that means doing every single minut step

208
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,139
all over again and by the time you beat

209
00:08:42,139 --> 00:08:43,819
this game you can write a strategy guide

210
00:08:43,819 --> 00:08:45,379
on it cuz you know it front to back

211
00:08:45,379 --> 00:08:47,660
after you scare off the Yaak is up from

212
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,129
the parlor the owner gives you a bunch

213
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:51,730
of balls but you use to buy a shamisen

214
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:54,500
what even it what even what even is that

215
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,230
okay it's that that's what it is I guess

216
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,790
okay I mean I guess I'm familiar I just

217
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,079
didn't know the name now we're off to

218
00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:02,000
the karaoke bar to sing the same song

219
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,740
three times in a row because Takeshi

220
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:06,050
Kitano is an insane person you actually

221
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:07,759
have to sing into the microphone on the

222
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:09,139
second controller which is pretty

223
00:09:09,139 --> 00:09:10,670
innovative for its time but it's

224
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:20,420
incredibly difficult and precise once

225
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,220
you've completed the songs guess what

226
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,980
happens yes guess what a bunch of yuccas

227
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,750
are storming to the bar and you have to

228
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,939
beat to share of all of them again on

229
00:09:28,939 --> 00:09:31,309
the same hearts then just in the nick of

230
00:09:31,309 --> 00:09:33,259
time an old man comes in and gives you a

231
00:09:33,259 --> 00:09:35,180
map and then you beat the shit out of

232
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,100
them it's not even an option you have to

233
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,019
do that but when you look at the map of

234
00:09:39,019 --> 00:09:41,209
course it's blank to reveal it you have

235
00:09:41,209 --> 00:09:43,550
to let it soak in water and wait five

236
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,709
minutes but not more than ten and then

237
00:09:45,709 --> 00:09:48,410
cry into the microphone or a fade it in

238
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:50,209
sunlight and let the controller's sit

239
00:09:50,209 --> 00:09:53,870
for an hour ah arbitrary wait times what

240
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:56,149
do you know it's an early MMO now that

241
00:09:56,149 --> 00:09:57,589
we've got our treasure map I say it's

242
00:09:57,589 --> 00:09:59,439
off to the South Pacific

243
00:09:59,439 --> 00:10:02,059
no seriously ahead to the airport and

244
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:04,590
board a plane for the South Pacific

245
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:06,630
you know this only just dawned on me

246
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,280
right now but do you realize that this

247
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,840
is a Nintendo game in which you quit

248
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,570
your job divorce your wife and go

249
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:17,070
treasure-hunting not honor best game

250
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:18,870
best King what do you get there you get

251
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,580
a gun well getting the gun is kind of

252
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,620
cool I guess I actually works it's not

253
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:25,140
just a bait-and-switch only now can you

254
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,820
sleep at the hotel and regain your

255
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,910
hearts oh my god it's beautiful it's the

256
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,590
most beautiful thing I've ever seen

257
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,750
you know for such a bad game when I saw

258
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,510
those seven hearts I was happy I guess

259
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,620
it just shows that life's all about

260
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:41,070
perspective okay this next part I can't

261
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:43,110
even stress enough this is one of the

262
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,730
hardest parts in any video game I've

263
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:47,820
ever played you have one shot at this

264
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,530
flying segment where you have to shoot a

265
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:51,360
revolve or a breast a hang-glider

266
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,760
and giant dive bombing pigeons and UFOs

267
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,780
if you get hit once you're dead game

268
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:59,160
over and you know what that means

269
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,690
divorce your wife sing the karaoke

270
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:02,820
question if it's ethical to eat Mormons

271
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,280
do the whole thing over again just to

272
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,780
have another go with this hang gliding

273
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:09,540
segment it could take you 20 30 times

274
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,610
before you get this and it wouldn't even

275
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:13,530
be so bad if you could fully control the

276
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:15,630
hang glider but once you drop altitude

277
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:17,130
the only way you can go back up is they

278
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:18,750
hit one of these gusts of wind which you

279
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,840
can accidentally shoot and destroy never

280
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,940
never in my life have I said goddamnit I

281
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,800
shot the wind again and meant it and

282
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,590
meant that can you even fathom how hard

283
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:31,260
this is was a human actually intended to

284
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,630
be able to overcome this after a while

285
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,340
it breaks you down it the only thing

286
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,510
that keeps you going is the thought of

287
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:37,590
what's coming next if there's the

288
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:39,180
thought of winning you can't let him

289
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:42,510
beat you it was designed to beat you and

290
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:44,070
you want to know how hard this game is I

291
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,860
started this review in 2012 come on I

292
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,290
have to do this I can't stop until I do

293
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:56,040
this please I got there I got to the

294
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,860
island can finally hear I'm in the

295
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,630
treasure cave this is the final stretch

296
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:02,340
of course they wouldn't give you a break

297
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,320
either there's literally enemies losing

298
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,050
from every crack of this cave talk about

299
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:09,240
having some PTSD or looking at this wall

300
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,710
to having flashbacks haven't do the

301
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:12,660
goddamn fucking pigeon section again

302
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:15,180
it's a non-stop barrage of the scorpions

303
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:15,889
a me

304
00:12:15,889 --> 00:12:18,170
his pirate skeletons and flame balls I

305
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,910
swear to God I don't even think you

306
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,499
could beat this segment if there wasn't

307
00:12:21,499 --> 00:12:23,389
a built-in exploit to the game which is

308
00:12:23,389 --> 00:12:25,639
if you pause the game and unpause it all

309
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:29,569
the enemies reset and then finally you

310
00:12:29,569 --> 00:12:32,389
see it just out of the corner of your

311
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:35,600
eye not everyone is created equal not in

312
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,919
a racist way I'm talking more about

313
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:38,689
willpower sorry if you thought that was

314
00:12:38,689 --> 00:12:41,269
a racist or sexist comment some are

315
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:42,799
quicker to make an excuse than a

316
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:44,959
commitment but we live in a world where

317
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,279
if you don't decide to be the very best

318
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:48,439
some will step up and be happy to take

319
00:12:48,439 --> 00:12:50,929
your place today we've scaled a new peak

320
00:12:50,929 --> 00:12:52,910
