1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,480
hey guys I'm back third year in the row

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,930
with Steve Sinclair of warframe and I

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:08,670
gotta start off by asking you one

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,370
question okay I've been wondering a lot

5
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,070
after my coverage of e3 how much did

6
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,170
they pay you to do the flute performance

7
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,039
yeah well and what level mastery are you

8
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:22,350
in right yes thank you

9
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,840
thank you yes

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,550
[Music]

11
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,500
that was I have a doppelganger the

12
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,540
number of people that were tweeting oh

13
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:35,920
it looks like Steve and then I changed

14
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,510
my profile picture to it yeah you're

15
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:39,130
probably not victory and then people

16
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:43,450
were like wait wow you're amazing yeah

17
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:47,590
no that guy's awesome he's like a master

18
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:51,640
in you were busy working on what we saw

19
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,040
here today that's right which was

20
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,710
freaking amazing yes but I do want to go

21
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:58,480
back one year when you first revealed

22
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,790
yes planes of Idlewild on yes how did

23
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:05,590
that do well for warframe it has given

24
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,630
it a new lease on life right and we're a

25
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:11,740
PvE focus game we have PvP focus you

26
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:15,040
know we have PvP modes but we need to

27
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,920
bring new kondu life just past the game

28
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,740
changes and evolves we're here at 10 o

29
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:23,320
con 3 and I meet players they've been

30
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,070
playing since you know 2013 why still

31
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:28,540
playing right that's because the game

32
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,190
keeps changing yeah right I guess some

33
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:33,460
people who was like yeah so the game is

34
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,670
really bad when I first played it okay

35
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:40,540
that open beta here but yeah it really

36
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,640
it showed that you know they stuck with

37
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,800
us and we stuck with it and we continued

38
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,840
and try you know the void resting our

39
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,400
laurels yeah you don't want to just be

40
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,740
like the weapon Factory right here's new

41
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:53,200
gun here's new gun here's new gun so it

42
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,270
did great for us what was crazy about it

43
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:59,020
was the huge boost in signups yeah

44
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,640
concurrency and number of people playing

45
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,160
before came out yeah I had a guy come up

46
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,620
to me I was even out oh yeah and people

47
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,810
were crazy if a warframe yeah I had a

48
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:09,670
guy come up to me I saw your video on

49
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:11,560
planes of Idol oh you actually got me

50
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,910
here and he had flew all the way out

51
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:15,640
from Australia so yeah this it's

52
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,379
definitely bringing new people in it's

53
00:02:17,379 --> 00:02:19,330
really what we just saw I think is gonna

54
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:21,730
bring even more people there with

55
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:24,129
nothing great yeah I am crazy about

56
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:27,670
space battles so I am so happy that we

57
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:30,069
are exploring this particular area of

58
00:02:30,069 --> 00:02:32,319
warframe right it's rich it has

59
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,269
potential it doesn't talk a little bit

60
00:02:34,269 --> 00:02:35,819
about this code name

61
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:40,079
bril Jack well Jack you know I don't

62
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:42,209
know you that's a conversation we have

63
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:43,530
with a lot of our people is that the

64
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:47,010
final name cuz that gives you the it's

65
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:48,599
gonna be on Rails please tell me it's

66
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:50,939
not exactly and it isn't unreal at all

67
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:54,719
and the demo has Rebecca flying the ship

68
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:56,819
kind of poorly at times maybe colliding

69
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:59,540
with a few things she's gonna be mad

70
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:03,209
know the when we did the landscapes and

71
00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:05,730
of course a big part of this big update

72
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:08,189
this year is going to be Fortuna and or

73
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:10,620
ballast which is this huge even larger

74
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,349
than planes of i'll on venus landscape

75
00:03:13,349 --> 00:03:16,230
oh my new culture a very a blade runner'

76
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,599
kind of really interesting you know DET

77
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:22,019
internment camp and so you don't want to

78
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:23,579
just take planes of eidolon and all the

79
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:25,620
systems you introduced and say okay what

80
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,540
are we doing next so that's part of the

81
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,189
theme of why we're saying what are the

82
00:03:29,189 --> 00:03:31,079
things that we learned what can we do

83
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:32,989
better what can we do differently

84
00:03:32,989 --> 00:03:37,319
however we really really pride ourselves

85
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:39,689
on taking chances with warframe and so

86
00:03:39,689 --> 00:03:41,639
at the end of the demo yes when you

87
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:43,979
think it's over the bombardment from

88
00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:46,319
space happens again and it's like is

89
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,540
anything we can do about this yeah and

90
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,209
down comes the frickin ship and it picks

91
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:52,739
you up and you're on there with your

92
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:54,349
team you hit the launch button

93
00:03:54,349 --> 00:03:56,519
seamlessly out through the atmosphere of

94
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:58,739
Venus and you rise up into this kind of

95
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:01,019
like strange oricon space filled with

96
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:03,239
these giant kind of nodes that used to

97
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:05,069
form the planetary defense grid around

98
00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:08,189
the planet you've got things like an FTL

99
00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:10,199
like engineering controls you can run

100
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:13,620
power you can do tactical things and

101
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:18,090
it's an attempt to say it is it is it is

102
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:20,459
yeah it is it has a bit of Star Trek it

103
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:22,530
has a bit of FTL but it has a whole lot

104
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:25,259
of warframe own old guy so I like like

105
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:27,659
the Phantom battle the planets and like

106
00:04:27,659 --> 00:04:28,530
Last Starfighter

107
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:31,500
so the ship isn't really no I know right

108
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,009
exactly

109
00:04:32,009 --> 00:04:33,630
I think there might be a remake coming

110
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,430
yeah I saw some concept there and I was

111
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:39,449
very excited so the ship is the ship is

112
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:41,099
not like a space sim you know you think

113
00:04:41,099 --> 00:04:43,620
about I love space Sims a lot of them

114
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,090
with you if you squint and look you see

115
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:47,370
that little ship flying you see the

116
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,150
triangle round

117
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,680
you're shooting at the little ride or

118
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,940
then they've added because you can't

119
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,110
figure out how to lead a target I guess

120
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:55,230
anyway it's not like that he'll Jack

121
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:58,260
real Jack is the ship's have crazy

122
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,840
abilities remember death block yes yeah

123
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,880
like he looks missile array and all this

124
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,380
kind of crazy stuff there's a fire

125
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,150
shield looking backed by all the planets

126
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:08,610
all of this though is taking place in

127
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:10,890
this kind of shared combat space there's

128
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:12,810
a corpus ship there you know like a

129
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,430
capital ship launching fighters at you

130
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:16,680
but it's not just like it's not just

131
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,780
like a mesh of a ship there's the actual

132
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:21,090
level of the game like people players

133
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:23,670
have been playing for years inside that

134
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:26,280
thing right now and so when they get

135
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,860
close enough they deploy Megan outer arc

136
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,750
wing she flies over dodging through the

137
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,850
missiles lands on it and now she's

138
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:34,560
playing the warframe that people know

139
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,020
yes meanwhile Rebecca's back on the ship

140
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,450
like hacking the turrets to shoot turn

141
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:41,280
them against them she's got her mini-map

142
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,440
she's tracking Megan's like kind of like

143
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,420
that moment in aliens right we're like

144
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,770
Gorman's like looking at the people

145
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:50,100
right and that's my heart my heart too

146
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,160
and so I'll show you actually before you

147
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,680
leave we have a poster from a version of

148
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,300
Dark Sector you know the studio has yes

149
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,370
and we tried to get this really wacky

150
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:01,410
aggressive sci-fi game called Dark

151
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:04,350
Sector made that was the idea a small

152
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:06,720
boarding party of really overpowered

153
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,660
co-op players working together flying a

154
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,460
ship and taking on giant capital ships

155
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,170
and destroying them from with them and

156
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:16,110
that's what we're doing and I'm glad I'm

157
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,760
glad for it fits right into the world

158
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:22,400
it's not something like battle royale

159
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,020
but I did skip ahead just cuz I'm so

160
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,000
excited about space stuff no that's not

161
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,030
in the far future what we saw there with

162
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:33,390
the the crawling let's talk about this

163
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,550
new area on rumors yeah yeah

164
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:39,720
so how like how big is it what can we

165
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,310
expect over there yeah I still have

166
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:44,250
spearfishing yeah exactly yeah we still

167
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,500
we still have a spearfishing it's

168
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,110
different this time because of course if

169
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:51,630
you know anything about you know high

170
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,580
school planets you know the studied

171
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,360
planets Venus is like a furnace

172
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,150
right and so that our story is that the

173
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,979
ancient race that came before the Tenno

174
00:06:59,979 --> 00:07:02,650
the work and they tried to basically

175
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:06,610
change the planet from within by and so

176
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:08,349
there's all of these this is like this

177
00:07:08,349 --> 00:07:10,180
winter storm that the players kind of

178
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,530
open they they come out of the elevator

179
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:13,120
and they're like what the hell like I'm

180
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,340
inspecting like lava and like a desert

181
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,289
wasteland and it's a winter old dorm

182
00:07:17,289 --> 00:07:19,659
it's cold as hell and so the reason for

183
00:07:19,659 --> 00:07:21,550
that is this kind of viscous fluid

184
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:23,020
that's flowing through the landscape

185
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,639
that's cooling it off and within that

186
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,319
there's like these kind of strange

187
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,599
robotic fish so like I said kind of like

188
00:07:28,599 --> 00:07:29,889
you don't just take the mechanics that

189
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:31,389
you taught them and throw them out but

190
00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:32,889
you want to cast a new light on them you

191
00:07:32,889 --> 00:07:35,620
want to twist them the thing I'm really

192
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:38,139
excited about it adding to that attic to

193
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:41,259
that main animal thing yeah yeah so this

194
00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:45,159
is really cool you know mimicking the

195
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:47,050
animals yeah so yeah can you imagine

196
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,180
like but design process is like me like

197
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,740
watching this like six year old dude

198
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,219
like here's how you make a moose call

199
00:07:53,219 --> 00:07:55,930
it's doing stuff where he's like and

200
00:07:55,930 --> 00:08:01,659
here's here's a moose in heat like we

201
00:08:01,659 --> 00:08:04,270
need that in warframe so you did it

202
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:07,300
exactly the real question is can we do

203
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,849
those calls outside of that little mode

204
00:08:09,849 --> 00:08:10,960
to annoy a friend

205
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:22,930
yes itself

206
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:24,460
send me self-aware you destroy the

207
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,500
spider and then everyone just gets out

208
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:31,060
there the animal lures it's cool because

209
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,680
it's something different it's a break

210
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,329
from all the murdering maiming and

211
00:08:34,329 --> 00:08:36,010
killing exactly and I think that's why

212
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:37,930
we did fishing which is hugely

213
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:39,430
successful for the game we had so many

214
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:41,740
people playing that and you know we did

215
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,390
the mining there's kind of like peaceful

216
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:48,390
pastimes like yeah we have like this

217
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:52,839
yeah now as far as those bosses that are

218
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:54,730
in there moving around crawl in iran

219
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:56,380
Turay and i haven't seen anything like

220
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,300
that before except for some of the

221
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,589
things that we saw on planes of I don't

222
00:08:59,589 --> 00:09:02,050
but I'm I'm wondering are we gonna get

223
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:04,390
some challenges with these massive

224
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:06,339
creatures right is that big momma one

225
00:09:06,339 --> 00:09:06,810
gonna

226
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:08,760
hard to take down cookie del over here

227
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,340
is an expert thousands of hours and he

228
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:14,040
shows one shot right how to take it down

229
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,529
in five seconds or less can we be

230
00:09:16,529 --> 00:09:18,870
guaranteed a different sort of game flow

231
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:21,270
to taking this thing down yeah so that

232
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:24,810
so obviously you know talking about

233
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:27,330
going back to the open-world stuff and

234
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:28,860
saying where the lessons learned so

235
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,860
that's a big one which is to say we

236
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,839
wanted to say these enemies only come

237
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,279
out at night so it requires a specific

238
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,330
logo but players are created oh yeah

239
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:39,960
don't break anything

240
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,420
find that build and just found right and

241
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:46,650
so those speedrun them so I can't

242
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:49,050
guarantee it because you know the big

243
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:50,790
game is the complexity and the players

244
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,970
have an ingenuity but our goal is to

245
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:56,520
make it entertaining loss seriously

246
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:00,150
difficult out and in and the demo you

247
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,100
saw like they ran because they're just

248
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,800
not ready yeah I love those things so

249
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,370
much because you know most games a lot

250
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:09,750
of games will have like a cool boss

251
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,980
fight and it'll be like a flat arena

252
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,070
right like it's like you as a developer

253
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:15,420
you're like oh well that's that's easy

254
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,530
because it doesn't have a walk on

255
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:18,210
anything it's not damaged Oh Ernest of

256
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:20,160
the world right that can lead to some

257
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,270
funny bugs where's so really cool thing

258
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:26,370
about these guys is they they'll climb

259
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:28,290
over the entire landscape and for some

260
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:30,060
reason that just makes it feel so much

261
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:32,730
more grounded you know and scary yes

262
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:34,950
alien yes that's what we should get in

263
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:37,980
these are these world um one other thing

264
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,660
that you guys are matted is I saw a

265
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,850
bunch of weapons on the table yes that's

266
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,650
right modular weapons right that's one

267
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:46,920
we got what's going on with these

268
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,320
weapons these are primaries or what are

269
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,750
their secondary yep so they're there we

270
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,150
call them kit guns

271
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:56,160
super creative name and alright they are

272
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,589
made of of components that the Solaris

273
00:10:58,589 --> 00:11:00,510
which are kind of like these you know

274
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:02,160
working-class people they're kind of

275
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,709
under the under the feel of the corpus

276
00:11:04,709 --> 00:11:06,240
oppression they've kind of repurposed

277
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,350
these things and you can build your own

278
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:10,410
weapons players you know love

279
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:12,390
customization and water and luck making

280
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:13,770
their own builds so we're still kind of

281
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:15,990
trying to feel out what's the best way

282
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:18,180
to give them that experience not just

283
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,150
with a gun to put my

284
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:21,010
into it but also change the gun

285
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:23,460
appearance and the whole feel of the gun

286
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:26,080
but about primary weapons are we gonna

287
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,780
yeah exactly stay tuned right sonic on

288
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:31,270
four but the really cool thing about

289
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:33,850
that is I think how they're gonna react

290
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:36,190
a lot of players will react really well

291
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:40,750
to the modular pets so you make your own

292
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:43,930
robot companion with Goofy in the way

293
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:45,670
you want we're talking about players and

294
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:47,830
opening up things to have them break the

295
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:49,480
game doesn't that seem a little daunting

296
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,580
letting them make their own weapons cuz

297
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,930
you know they're everybody's just gonna

298
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:55,660
min/max and make that most ultimate and

299
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,220
they're gonna post the guide to say

300
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,500
here's the me but speaking of min maxing

301
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,170
yeah you got this really awesome new way

302
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:04,510
to get around this larger world cuz you

303
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,190
guys said it was like four times bigger

304
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:09,130
that's right four tons of it yeah so a

305
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:11,290
new creative way to get around and by

306
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:13,240
the way we can still do the arch you're

307
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,760
arguing now or you can still run buddy

308
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,230
but now we've got this new hoverboard

309
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:21,700
yes hell yeah give me cuz that's back to

310
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,070
the future and all that that eighties

311
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:27,550
lovely miss and so my question to you

312
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,290
men Langston is people are gonna want to

313
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,170
ice all those sick tricks yeah you know

314
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:33,640
we're gonna get like a backflip

315
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,800
okay hell yeah there is a backflip but I

316
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,290
was wondering with the arc arc wing you

317
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,150
could fire from it can you fire from

318
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:42,010
this hoverboard I didn't see anybody do

319
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:43,900
that right right

320
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:47,050
we are still locked horns locked in

321
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:49,240
ambitious debate whether you can fire

322
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,900
from this now my side of the debate you

323
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:56,130
know and again it's a very democratic

324
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:58,690
different points you gotta approach it

325
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:00,400
that way absolutely absolutely

326
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,500
and so my perspective is if you can

327
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,820
shoot from it from something that's

328
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,290
going to in a miles an hour you never

329
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:06,880
gonna want to get up get off of it

330
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,590
so what we're trying to do is integrate

331
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:11,020
tricks yeah that actually start the

332
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,390
combat better for you alright so if you

333
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:15,580
ollie off that wall come back and do the

334
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,470
flip and you have just that augmentation

335
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:19,090
for it the boss'll enemies then you're

336
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:21,910
off shooting aim gliding and then you

337
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,530
land back on it and keep going alright

338
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:25,900
you know it's going for the Michael J

339
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:29,080
Fox all right grantie jump back yet I

340
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,030
can see your point never wanting to get

341
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:32,150
off and kind of ruining

342
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:34,010
game and then sands butts all right well

343
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:38,270
keep debating it it's cool anyways so as

344
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:39,650
long as we can you know do those

345
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:42,650
situations our friends actually can we

346
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:45,830
customize those just like everything is

347
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:47,510
customizable in this game you've got a

348
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:49,550
passion frame it's important okay so I

349
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,500
guess the biggest question then is when

350
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:55,490
when and then when really I mean Willie

351
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:59,330
really wins yeah I so we're looking for

352
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:00,980
Fortuna which is our huge open world

353
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:05,360
expansion we're kind of a me fall rail

354
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,920
Jack I mean that's the million dollar

355
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,350
question I would love if we could drop

356
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:11,600

357
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,010
players to experience before the end of

358
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:14,480
the year that was nothing that's the

359
