1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,210
so every Disney cember I always find a

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:05,580
theme to tie all the videos together but

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,230
the downside of that is whenever I do

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:08,880
that a lot of other movies are released

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,250
and I'm not able to give them the Disney

6
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,719
zember treatment I mean don't get me

7
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,519
wrong Disney has had its hand in a lot

8
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:17,250
of things TV shows and movies and

9
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,230
animation of course but as they continue

10
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,660
to expand and keep buying properties it

11
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,820
seems like there's just so much Disney

12
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,160
coming out all at once so this year I'm

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,320
gonna make up for that this year it's by

14
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,420
popular demand that's right there's no

15
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,000
connecting themes there's no one studio

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,950
or one style of film we're looking at

17
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:36,930
all it has to do is have Disney's name

18
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,730
on there somewhere and be requested by a

19
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,440
lot of people you name it there'll be

20
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,390
animated films I haven't done yet Pixar

21
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,370
films I haven't done yet Disney Channel

22
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,710
movies Marvel films old and new even

23
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,660
films that just came out this year now

24
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,430
like before some of these I've discussed

25
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,469
before with my brother Rob on sibling

26
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,690
rivalry so if you want a longer review

27
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,070
of some of these movies and a different

28
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,690
point of view you can go and watch those

29
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,879
but I also like the idea of letting time

30
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:02,039
pass whether it be a lot or little and

31
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:03,210
seeing if they still have the same

32
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,519
impact as when I just saw them after all

33
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,990
the sibling rivalries are done right

34
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:08,640
after we've seen it so this allows me

35
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,350
some time to collect my thoughts even

36
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:13,170
more it is so cool just to see how much

37
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,150
bigger Disney is becoming I mean just

38
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,409
when you thought they couldn't get any

39
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:16,950
bigger

40
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:19,049
here they are owning all these different

41
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:21,509
properties and studios and for the most

42
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:23,070
part they're turning out pretty damn

43
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,140
good material but again we're here to

44
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,180
discuss what works and what doesn't

45
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,770
what's timeless and what's immediately

46
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,590
dated and on top of that what works as

47
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,600
being timeless or dated and what doesn't

48
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,579
work as being timeless or dated so if

49
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:37,710
there's ever a Disney movie Marvel movie

50
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:39,869
Disney Channel original movie Pixar film

51
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:41,880
or whatever I haven't gotten to this is

52
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,409
your chance to see if I finally catch up

53
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:45,720
with it sit back and enjoy this is

54
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,159
Disney cember by popular demand

55
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:50,200
you

56
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:59,880
[Music]

57
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:05,000
you
