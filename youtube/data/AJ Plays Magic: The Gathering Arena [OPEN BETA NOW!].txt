00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:17,039
arena which actually I don't know what

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,439
what it is how is that compared to

7
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,230
Planeswalkers I mean you know the app

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,150
that I used to do back in 2000 it's

9
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:25,619
pretty similar I mean this is gonna be

10
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:27,960
the more it's a better UI version of

11
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,609
Moto it's great for new players to come

12
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:31,679
in play some standard and draft I'm

13
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,420
bringing Alex in because he is a

14
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,120
absolute magic master how long you been

15
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,329
playing magic 25 years 25 years was also

16
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:42,390
a magic judge is a magic judge and he's

17
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:43,910
going to kind of teach me the ropes

18
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:46,110
we're gonna go through one game together

19
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,719
and then I'm gonna let him loose on some

20
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,870
people online and see him kick ass and

21
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,120

22
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,280

playing I I I'm not playing magic

34
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,810

35
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:25,110
maybe about 10 years ago but I started

36
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,600
in first edition magic until my mom

37
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,570
found out and then she threw away all my

38
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:33,829
cards I even did a Magic the Gathering

39
00:01:33,829 --> 00:01:36,780

[Music]

80
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,810
these are the characters of the coast

81
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:34,670
have been putting a lot of emphasis on

82
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:37,070
these guys story and stuff you have some

83
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:38,750
really talented writers writing a story

84
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,430
and interweaving into the game and it's

85
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:42,260
great okay this guy looks cool this I

86
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,519
was convenient I think he's real

87
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,910
obviously why would I play this if you

88
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:49,130
know there's no way we gotta just play

89
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:50,840
the physical one well you don't always

90
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,640
have access to an a willing opponent

91
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,900
sometimes you want to test something out

92
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,470
and it just takes it's nice having the

93
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,450
ability to say look I got thirty minutes

94
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:00,470
before the movie starts

95
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:02,540
I don't want to necessarily bug him he's

96
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,010
got stuff to do he can just jump into a

97
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,730
game and and

98
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:08,700
okay cool all right let's do it jump

99
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,760
right in you'll need to choose a deck

100
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,739
yeah so let's select my biggest deck

101
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:16,350
actually I don't go my decks are the

102
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:20,850
same let's go before each game alright

103
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:25,610
let's play but going in into the editor

104
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:28,380
yes there's a good search function you

105
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:31,919
can those are the lands that are so on

106
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,300
the bottom you can see how many that you

107
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,190
have and how many are in there okay and

108
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:37,860
the sidebar here that's the same 25

109
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,600
forests yeah is that a good number

110
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,370
that's about right I mean you've got a

111
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:43,830
long do in your day well see it depends

112
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,630
on like the the mana is what we're

113
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,250
talking about the curve of the deck is

114
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,840
what we talk about when we're dealing

115
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,060
with things too so you have a lot of

116
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,979
threes and that's five and more fives

117
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:55,440
and a six and a seven and a seven and a

118
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,180
12 and so you want to make sure that

119
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,470
you're hitting land drops every single

120
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:00,810
turn you may have an opponent that plays

121
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:02,280
a lot of little creatures but once you

122
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,600
really slam down the big one it's gonna

123
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,880
act as a wall and it'll eat up all their

124
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,100
little ones okay let's do it let's jump

125
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,889
right in guys that's great I don't know

126
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:12,570
if he's gonna throw me against AI or a

127
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:14,340
player right away if I'm not a player

128
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,979
I'm gonna cut it shoe a player it should

129
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:21,000
be a player okay

130
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,720
pretty quick magic is big man and I'm so

131
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,610
happy that magic is popular it is my

132
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:29,400
favorite card game of all time I really

133
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:29,880
love it

134
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,610
you're opening hand mulligan so you you

135
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:33,990
can actually hover over all these and

136
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:35,460
see what they are so this is if you got

137
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,070
a three drop a three drop a for drop

138
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:40,770
five drop and a twelve obviously and we

139
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:42,300
don't need the twelve right in our oh so

140
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,250
this is nice because it's it's it's mana

141
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,990
cost is reduced based on the total power

142
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,370
of creatures you control so he's not

143
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:48,750
actually twelve it actually gets smaller

144
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,040
and smaller the more your board cities

145
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,380
but the problem is you've got two lands

146
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,060
and nothing but three drops and you go

147
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,230
first you're not gonna get a draw on

148
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,310
your first try

149
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:58,710
so this isn't great I think maybe mol

150
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:03,140
getting is a nice Mulligan yeah

151
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,760
these those are better that's the better

152
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:09,570
all right let's go let's let's go and

153
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:12,210
then now you'll get describe so you get

154
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:14,070
to decide what it's cry that's new to me

155
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:16,320
if you ever start the game with less

156
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,580
than seven cards uh-huh

157
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,110
once you agree to keep that hand you

158
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:20,370
look at the top card of your deck and

159
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:21,600
you can either leave it there or put it

160
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,140
to the bottom

161
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:24,180
why don't what you need something new

162
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,830
it's new within the last couple years

163
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:28,260
but it helps you know okay like I'm old

164
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,850
too for how am I gonna win now you get a

165
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:34,260
little bit on top oh I didn't know sure

166
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,240
you yeah well I should have pick

167
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,800
something out you got a five drop on top

168
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,990
you go first so go ahead and go and drag

169
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:40,950
one of your lands up into the

170
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:43,470
battlefield okay and the game knows that

171
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:47,970
you had nothing to do ok the interface

172
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:49,740
is pretty clean it's you know it does

173
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,350
remind me of the other you know previous

174
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:55,620
ones back in the 2000 early 2000s

175
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:59,400
however why does it get small like that

176
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,800
it's just to save space as best things

177
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,479
get at it and you can always hover over

178
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:04,919
anything

179
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:08,590
all right so there's my creature when a

180
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:12,250
Highland game dies you gain two life oh

181
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,500
damn it we're playing Merritt Beck's I

182
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,759
wanted to play against something else

183
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,439
you bastard case oh you got another land

184
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:18,400
which is great so you want to make a

185
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,870
land drop okay now let's see what else

186
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,310
could we get what do we have got Blanche

187
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:23,919
with armor we got another one of those

188
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,400
and we have an elf druid that cards

189
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,750
really good because we want to get a

190
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,009
head on mana uh-huh

191
00:07:30,009 --> 00:07:31,389
and so it's gonna it looks at the top

192
00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:32,650
five cards your library you can put it

193
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:33,879
at land from among them into the

194
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:35,650
battlefield tapped so I really like that

195
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:37,300
card because you've got big things to do

196
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,520
okay so I think that's probably the one

197
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,229
that you want to play all right that

198
00:07:41,229 --> 00:07:42,789
goes out now do I want to trade with

199
00:07:42,789 --> 00:07:43,659
this guy

200
00:07:43,659 --> 00:07:45,490
you definitely can so you can select any

201
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:49,810
of those lands okay grab it puts in the

202
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:53,020
play tap and you're you can definitely

203
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,550
if you want to tray creatures I mean

204
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:55,990
you'll gain to live they'll gain to life

205
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:58,860
ah huh yeah let's do it

206
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,750
absolute act one attacker one attacker

207
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:05,590
oh right and then he chews and he defend

208
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:11,830
with the animations are nicer than the

209
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:17,259
previous oh okay and and what it was it

210
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:19,330
Magic the Gathering online that really

211
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:22,029
archaic awful looking things like I do

212
00:08:22,029 --> 00:08:23,919
not want to play this is this that

213
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,500
replacement it's not Oh magic lines

214
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,960
still going going strong okay what

215
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,990
they're doing magic online is still

216
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:33,339
gonna be around for modern legacy

217
00:08:33,339 --> 00:08:34,849
vintage and ever

218
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:36,800
okay so what I want to do is probably

219
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,839
Titanic growth on this hit them directly

220
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:40,760
and bring out a Greek so that's a great

221
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,839
common trick it's an instant speed

222
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,490
combat trick so you can use it to save a

223
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,260
creature if he tries to swing into you

224
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,149
with something I didn't consider uh so

225
00:08:47,149 --> 00:08:48,740
you can plug another Highland game you

226
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:51,800
can play I think the goal is to try to

227
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,750
get up to that gigantosaurus as soon as

228
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,089
possible the only one land away so you

229
00:08:56,089 --> 00:08:58,760
can go and swing yeah can I swing with

230
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,560
five five you definitely can I think

231
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,880
there's more value in holding it but if

232
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,500
you want to just give them the the punch

233
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,440
you could definitely do that I want to

234
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,820
give them the punch that's that's how I

235
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:11,029
would play and but you're better than me

236
00:09:11,029 --> 00:09:12,260
so I probably should have done what he

237
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,990
said but whatever we'll see all right

238
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:16,310
what does this mean are you waiting for

239
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:16,760
your pony

240
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,380
okay so now it's a five five and then

241
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:21,410
now you get to attack an attacker you

242
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:31,329
got no damn

243
00:09:31,329 --> 00:09:33,560
time with the manna what's true to the

244
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:37,759
cowboy race that's great ads you can add

245
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:40,490
manna by just tapping yeah so because he

246
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:46,100
requires a tap he doesn't have haste but

247
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,899
now you just get to attack with both and

248
00:09:47,899 --> 00:09:50,300
next turn you'll get to cast your dragon

249
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:59,059
can i to attacker so you always have to

250
00:09:59,059 --> 00:10:00,740
keep in mind so he's getting manna

251
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:04,899
flooded or manna true probably means

252
00:10:04,899 --> 00:10:07,579
they're come something so now you can

253
00:10:07,579 --> 00:10:10,089
plan and you can play your gigantasaurus

254
00:10:10,089 --> 00:10:15,259
got my jaw can't a mother trucker yeah

255
00:10:15,259 --> 00:10:17,600
that's a big boy nice okay

256
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,730
you'd probably don't want to swing into

257
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:22,279
his 5:5 with your 1 1 1 3 right because

258
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:24,309
they'll just die no matter what because

259
00:10:24,309 --> 00:10:29,209
they don't combine do 5 damages 2 3 4

260
00:10:29,209 --> 00:10:31,339
so he'll still survive and he'll kill

261
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,329
all three of y'all

262
00:10:32,329 --> 00:10:34,399
so no attacker no it's actors and if he

263
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:35,750
attacks you can block with your highland

264
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:38,120
game if you want or you can block with

265
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,519
all of them it gives me life but I don't

266
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:47,120
think you'll get but that's only for one

267
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,889
turn no that's forever oh well guess

268
00:10:48,889 --> 00:10:53,449
what I got the same thing mother food it

269
00:10:53,449 --> 00:10:55,380
is here trample

270
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,580
let's hit dough and man

271
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,080
so huh forever screeching you can see

272
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,510
the tariff what is vigilant so it

273
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:04,360
doesn't tap to attack so just gets to

274
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,420
say hit there and attack and walk in the

275
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:12,190
crap all right what do you recommend

276
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:13,870
here well you got a guy that you kind of

277
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:15,760
want to die you get some value when it

278
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,050
dies so I think that's a pretty easy

279
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:22,180
chump blog yeah lunched and he didn't

280
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,710
have any trample so I don't need to

281
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:26,620
worry about that now I can boost mine

282
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,510
later and then trade with him maybe

283
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:31,630
what's that what's rabbit bite ah target

284
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,190
creature you control deals damage equal

285
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:34,810
to its power to target creature you

286
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:37,630
don't matter all that could kill that

287
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,910
thing buff it with armor right yeah

288
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,230

so target creature you control boom and

293
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,280

so quick I'll try different no no we're

327

330
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,650
doing and why you're doing it while you

331
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:30,300
do it

332
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,950
get a little bit of you know some

333
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:35,800
insight into your thought process trade

334
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,020
chairs

335
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:40,210
now obviously you don't have your decks

336
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:42,640
no you know it would be really nice are

337
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,710
you able to login would you rather use

338
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:46,210
your deck now we can play with these new

339
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:47,230
ones I've never seen it before

340
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:53,950
okay I know how many magic games do you

341
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:58,900
think you've played in your life we're

342
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:04,450
talking in the hundred thousand yeah we

343
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:08,440
got a pretty high and we got three lands

344
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,360
and we're on the draw that looks pretty

345
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:14,020
good your opponent goes first

346
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:17,920
yeah so you play magic every week you go

347
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,780
to tournaments you drive well we go to

348
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,700
events if I'm not judging a big event I

349
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:30,510
will play a legacy event I love legacy

350
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:33,640
well God darn it we'll see it could be a

351
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:37,180
custom deck well it just came out guys

352
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:39,310
so right now is the time to play because

353
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:40,660
you're gonna be playing a bunch of bunch

354
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:43,090
of doom just trying things out but every

355
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,830
once in a while you're gonna hit against

356
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:46,120
somebody who knows what they're doing

357
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,050
and that's when you can learn

358
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:50,550
and it's interesting he's coming out

359
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:51,810
right away but of course that's what

360
00:14:51,810 --> 00:15:03,540
these fire Tech's do little buddy now if

361
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,940
he attacks I get to trade in so half of

362
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,640
my targets

363
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:14,110
oh this is not good

364
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:18,490
[Music]

365
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:21,560
block with our little guy

366
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:26,550
[Music]

367
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:30,870
we traded there too is scary we got we

368
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:34,230
got our own and I don't want to attack

369
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:38,820
and lose anyway they're total waste and

370
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,320
the next turn I've got Devils hopeful we

371
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,270
get man that we can play right up into

372
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:45,660
the ground what does the devil do for

373
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:51,900
you oh yeah god damn mirror matches

374
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:59,870
[Music]

375
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:06,089
great we're betting what we have in our

376
00:16:06,089 --> 00:16:08,339
hand and what's coming up is better than

377
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:11,459
what he has we're falling behind on mana

378
00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:16,330
no now

379
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:18,490
[Music]

380
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:20,590
that's a mystery so let's just play on

381
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:24,190
our

382
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:30,120
[Music]

383
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,459
how are you able to tell are we ahead or

384
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:34,350
behind here or it's too hard we've got

385
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:35,339
more cards

386
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:38,189
we're definitely down a little life you

387
00:16:38,189 --> 00:16:40,769
have more cards in our hand but shit it

388
00:16:40,769 --> 00:16:43,949
comes to trample just the one right now

389
00:16:43,949 --> 00:16:45,449
so no matter what we're gonna take the

390
00:16:45,449 --> 00:16:52,139
one I would want to trade okay and that

391
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:54,329
one one creature will buy us time no he

392
00:16:54,329 --> 00:16:56,490
won't because it's trample yeah I mean

393
00:16:56,490 --> 00:17:02,610
we're gonna take one in regardless we

394
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:04,439
need more man no we do need the mana

395
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:06,089
we've got this removal spell which is

396
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:10,319
nice so wouldn't that do for it allows

397
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,630
us to so this says whenever dragon into

398
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:14,309
the battlefield you can pay red and just

399
00:17:14,309 --> 00:17:15,539
return it to our hand it's really

400
00:17:15,539 --> 00:17:16,529
powerful because we have two dragons

401
00:17:16,529 --> 00:17:20,279
uh-huh and then he's down to two cards

402
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:21,360
and we're sitting on five so we have

403
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,909
more resources if he goes right but

404
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:26,309
we're not getting man yeah I mean we'll

405
00:17:26,309 --> 00:17:27,870
eventually get it I think starting to

406
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:37,860
get in is probably oh that's quick just

407
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:40,049
hit the all attackers button if that's

408
00:17:40,049 --> 00:17:41,820
what interface I'm really liking the

409
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,679
interface it's really clean you can set

410
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,360
stops like if you want to stop in your

411
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,490
untap run upkeep it's like if you have

412
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:48,840
instance you want to do before they draw

413
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,429
their card you can click these things

414
00:17:50,429 --> 00:17:55,020
and stop at the appropriate time that's

415
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:57,809
a big that's a charging so that's got it

416
00:17:57,809 --> 00:18:00,120
can attack right away trample taste oh

417
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,940
my god

418
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:07,090
[Music]

419
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:10,000
got some really nice dragons well we got

420
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,880
darn it we got a man is screwed that's

421
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,680
why you play three odd best two out of

422
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:20,050
three well you can't do anything right

423
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:22,000
now what about that card you just got

424
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,070
this only does two damage I've got five

425
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,200
so we're just gonna go ahead and put the

426
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,830
pattern if he brings out another big boy

427
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:31,750
I think it's over yeah we need to have

428
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:35,110
another lamp as long as you control a

429
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:38,680
dragon fly well you don't

430
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:49,840
so because we'll definitely trade that

431
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,940
into that shock that take five and the

432
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,320
cuido should be fine

433
00:18:53,320 --> 00:19:03,940
yeah all right

434
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,530
the reason why we're not blocking the

435
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:07,929
five-five is it's got a tramp gun

436
00:19:07,929 --> 00:19:15,130
trample you and then shock that out that

437
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:15,880
was at the end of history

438
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,970
okay there we go but it might be too

439
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:20,490
late

440
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:22,330
alright so when this is the battlefield

441
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:25,059
I can pay three so that doesn't do

442
00:19:25,059 --> 00:19:27,299
anything for us right now

443
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:29,679
this is I think the best bet that we've

444
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,289
got unfortunately can't pay one if we

445
00:19:32,289 --> 00:19:39,220
draw land what does that mean he's

446
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,090
looking at your card

447
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:42,580
uh yeah well he's looking at the card

448
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:43,900
but he's got to resolve this ability so

449
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,850
this is Neal five damage him immediately

450
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:58,950
or he has to sacrifice a creature nice

451
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:01,659
yeah if we get another land I feel we're

452
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:03,370
gonna turn it back a little on our side

453
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:06,549
right now we're at a stalemate he's got

454
00:20:06,549 --> 00:20:07,390
a little bit better

455
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:10,750
he's at a card edition yeah he is out of

456
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:14,110
cards and he wants to trade see we have

457
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:17,860
three enough four cards in hand I think

458
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:20,049
I would assume instead he's gonna go get

459
00:20:20,049 --> 00:20:23,200
a land he has no cards oh nice boy so I

460
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,850
still had plays over here anyway yeah

461
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:28,030
which is which is nice

462
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:30,340
I think I just wanna get the removal

463
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:34,600
spell back in my hand one on took Oh

464
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,760
pressured I'm okay you being recorded

465
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,919
alive I like this car like this it

466
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:40,480
allows me better play next turn with

467
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,350
this uh-huh

468
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:43,330
why cuz this says whenever another non

469
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:44,980
took and dragon into the battlefield get

470
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,659
a five five I'm gonna play another

471
00:20:46,659 --> 00:20:48,789

472

removal spell see this is why magic oven

476
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,559

477
00:21:11,559 --> 00:21:14,660
Nixon to rush the you son-of-a-bitch

478

really nice ya know the land so let's go

480
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:31,610
to combat

481
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:34,809
let's see is it worth playing this

482
00:21:34,809 --> 00:21:37,509
creature well you got to get it in so

483
00:21:37,509 --> 00:21:39,159
that it gets past something that's gonna

484
00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:41,230
do yeah

485
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:43,720
oh it deals three damage to target

486
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,240
opponent or planeswalker and three

487
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,429
damage to one target creature up to one

488
00:21:48,429 --> 00:21:52,480
target creature so I don't have to you

489
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,840
have to do it on one floor watch it but

490
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,240
he's gonna survive and it'll reset the

491
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,669
hell I think there was a way for me to

492
00:22:00,669 --> 00:22:05,110
say all right looks like we turned it

493
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:08,919
around oh Jesus he's got them fiery

494
00:22:08,919 --> 00:22:13,570
finishes what this mother sucker this

495
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:18,100
mother trucker he's holding on alright

496
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:21,249
let's let's swing well why is that white

497
00:22:21,249 --> 00:22:23,350
card good it's an artifact so it says

498
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,789
when inches battlefield destroy a target

499
00:22:24,789 --> 00:22:26,470
non-land permanent loner controls

500
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:32,049
hmm so we've got an ace in our so what

501
00:22:32,049 --> 00:22:34,539
this does is I can play this now and

502
00:22:34,539 --> 00:22:35,769
potentially kill him next turn if he

503
00:22:35,769 --> 00:22:40,210
draws nothing if I so it's a choice

504
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:41,860
right so this doesn't destroy anything

505
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,419
if it's about a field now but it

506
00:22:43,419 --> 00:22:46,749
presents leave or I wait see if what he

507
00:22:46,749 --> 00:22:48,669
draws on Lethal lethal Kostecki is that

508
00:22:48,669 --> 00:22:50,830
time that he's gonna die day so we can

509
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:53,289
just play this now and then we have a

510
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:58,720
removal for something because we got he

511
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,309
doesn't bring out something massive and

512
00:23:02,309 --> 00:23:05,830
he bring down we gotta be back correctly

513

I'm so happy you won out traffic gone up

517
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:23,210
I feel that Excel is this big magic

518
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:24,590
player and he's gonna lose the first

519
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:26,420
game but his variance in the game for

520
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,860
sure yeah I mean but that's what makes

521
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:30,170
magic so addicting I mean there's

522
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:31,700
there's die rolls which changed a lot of

523
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,590
things and even when you're playing the

524
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:34,700
same deck it's like what part of the

525
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,650
deck dishes

526
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:41,450

527
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:44,210
and and you know for every you know

528
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:45,830
unbeatable deck that you build

529
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:47,540
somebody's gonna have a deck that can

530
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,790
counter that deck and that's why magic

531
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:53,560
is so addicting and yeah guys so I

532
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:56,780
really enjoy Magic the Gathering this

533
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:59,450
interface and how clean it is I really

534
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:04,160
like it sure let's go get one from the

535
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:07,310
store hey let me figure out this aspect

536
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:11,090
of the game busting attacks I love

537
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:13,780
opening packs too but real packs where I

538
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:17,510
smell those cards and the beautiful

539
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:20,330
beautiful artwork alright ready let's

540
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:29,540
bust a pack together go okay so we are

541
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,580
chromatically lands that you control

542
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:35,720
have tap add one mana of any color so it

543
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,220
means that your force can now make blue

544
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,630
if you want them to they can make red if

545
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:40,280
you want them to so this is a good card

546
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,380
if you want to have a multicolored deck

547
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:46,160
like a blue red here okay so you just

548
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,120
got a bunch you got a bunch of things

549
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,260
you get a couple of comments you have

550
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,870
someone comments and you got the red

551
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:54,050
okay and then you see as we do things

552
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:55,580

556
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:02,270
of multicolored decks but see we're

557
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:03,350

559
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:06,950
uncommon wild card and the one next to

560
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:08,780

561
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,520

562
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,230

00:25:46,299 --> 00:25:51,399
here we go

574
00:25:51,399 --> 00:25:54,200
why do they hide this card well it's the

575
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,639
excitement you get to click it to see

576
00:25:55,639 --> 00:25:56,480
what it is now

577
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,549
it couldn't be a crappy uncommon no it

578
00:25:58,549 --> 00:26:01,210
has to be a rare a mythic okay cool

579
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:04,220
that's a good card it's two cards what

580
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,659
the hell is this so it's it's dual

581
00:26:05,659 --> 00:26:07,549
purpose so this this card does to update

582
00:26:07,549 --> 00:26:08,779
what like two things in your hand you

583
00:26:08,779 --> 00:26:10,009
can do either the left side or the right

584
00:26:10,009 --> 00:26:11,929
side it's great so it's a double sided

585
00:26:11,929 --> 00:26:14,570
in real life it's not it's not double

586
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:16,250
sided it looks exactly like that in real

587
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:17,809
life where there's two smaller look

588
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:19,129
magic card looking things in the same

589
00:26:19,129 --> 00:26:19,519
car

590
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:21,799

erratic Cyclops zero dwell three to

605

610
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:19,900

we're looking for a mythic dang it

621
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:47,760
already got a recluse

622
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,980

624
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:54,790
got to come a walk out so I don't know

625
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:56,590
if any common in the game redeem this

626
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:58,630
wild card for any common card by adding

627
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:00,100
the desired card to your deck that's

628
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,720
cool that's a mechanic it wasn't in the

629
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:08,170
bridge oh uh a tratar the silencer costs

630
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:11,020
for cannot be blocked

631
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:15,610
whenever deals combat damage to a player

632
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,650
exile target creature that player

633
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:20,710
controls and put a hit counter on that

634
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:23,110
card that player loses the game if they

635
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:25,240
own three or more exiled cars with hit

636
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:28,920
counters owner shuffles but then but

637
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,880
unfortunately you have to shuffle her

638
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,680
into your yes run up to four of them

639
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,550
then what you're doing is you're

640
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:35,110
constantly putting these these hits out

641
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:38,350
and then in limited it's great so it can

642
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:40,480
it acts as a removal spell but that she

643
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,100
goes into your deck the first time she

644
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,740
attacks after after that connects so

645
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,600
after she deals damage then she shuffles

646
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,980
back but you get good opportunity to run

647
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:48,429
more than one

648
00:28:48,429 --> 00:28:51,279
Axew oh right right how many can you put

649
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:52,990

651
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:57,190
cool man I could see the theming that's

652
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:59,200
one thing that magic I'd say gets right

653
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,299
right yeah the clearer the flavor in the

654
00:29:01,299 --> 00:29:03,940
game is it's pretty awesome all right so

655
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,200
you can go to your decks right now and

656
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,990
then you can select like edit any one of

657
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:09,610
them you can see which and I can show

658
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:11,470
you all right so let's say we were

659
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:13,389
sticking with green oh you can even name

660
00:29:13,389 --> 00:29:17,759
your own decks here Angry Joe's might

661
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:23,049
and edit then see how you have you have

662
00:29:23,049 --> 00:29:24,940
one mythic wild card it shows you how

663
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:27,279
many you've got redeem this for any

664
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:29,139
mythic rare card yep

665
00:29:29,139 --> 00:29:33,759
anyone that's so cool okay how do I do

666
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:35,350
it well you want to select a mythic rare

667
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:38,409
so like is there what kind of mythic are

668
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:40,480
you looking for well go green so go to

669
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,490
the search function at the right button

670
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:44,649
yeah so that I think you click the that

671
00:29:44,649 --> 00:29:53,499
one and so searching is the screen we're

672
00:29:53,499 --> 00:29:56,919
looking for once you don't have okay now

673
00:29:56,919 --> 00:29:58,330
it's showing you all the green mythic oh

674
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:01,659
my gosh so that's a new one that's

675
00:30:01,659 --> 00:30:06,879
really really nasty you tell me which

676
00:30:06,879 --> 00:30:10,389
one you think I like I mean Plains what

677
00:30:10,389 --> 00:30:12,519
carnage tyrants really gross so if you

678
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:13,509
read what cut it so it can't be

679
00:30:13,509 --> 00:30:15,429
countered so blue decks automatically

680
00:30:15,429 --> 00:30:16,690
lose that card it's very hard from the

681
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,490
view of this oh you can trample and hex

682
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:20,259
proves what hex prove they can't target

683
00:30:20,259 --> 00:30:22,509
it with spells or abilities oh this this

684
00:30:22,509 --> 00:30:25,480
is like my bad boy creature this is my

685
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,850
pet you ain't doing anything about this

686
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:28,419
that's right

687
00:30:28,419 --> 00:30:30,159
okay I like they have to have a thing

688
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:31,779
that says he's a dinosaur I love

689
00:30:31,779 --> 00:30:33,490
dinosaurs it's not so click on him okay

690
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:35,200
then turtle mythic we're into it and

691
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,999
then use to confirm that is so cool that

692
00:30:36,999 --> 00:30:40,899
I could in and so that to me feels more

693
00:30:40,899 --> 00:30:44,970
fair than having to like bus like spend

694
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:47,710
$150 and never get like the car that I

695
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:49,899
want so that's really nice of them does

696
00:30:49,899 --> 00:30:52,029
that fuck their business I don't know I

697
00:30:52,029 --> 00:30:54,040
guess

698
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:57,080
so good it's been out for twenty frickin

699
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,180
years now that five something that

700
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,470
people are gonna be playing no matter

701
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:01,820
what okay cool

702
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,410
it so now you can have the tunic so if

703
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:08,630
you go back to okay so it already added

704
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:10,190
so you can see it's right there it's at

705
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:11,060
the bottom of your deck so you're

706
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:13,520
running sixty-one cards which is fine or

707
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,590
you can cut something so you can get rid

708
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:18,560
of like the meteor gone you could get

709
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:21,680
rid of something just cost seven yeah

710
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,180
maybe you don't want that cuz it yeah

711
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:29,720
I'm gonna take that out all right guys

712
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,910
well we think we covered pretty much

713
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:34,150
everything that's Magic the Gathering

714
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:36,140
arena

715
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:38,090
I'd say the interface is really really

716
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:42,170
nice it's a great replacement for you

717
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:45,080
know well I wouldn't say replacement I

718
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:48,050
just say you know where you could play

719
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:49,910
against people online test things out

720
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:51,560
really quickly when you're not playing

721
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:54,650
in you know in person because I know if

722
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:56,240
I said this this guy would get on me

723
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,760
right I know your replaces the actual

724
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,680
game it fits a different purpose yeah

725
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,750
it's nice to have around and you can

726
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:05,090
like have three or four people just

727
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:06,440
yelling at each other saying oh you

728
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,550
should have played that and it's great

729
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:09,590
this this is this works for me because

730
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:11,630
you know I I'm not really one to go out

731
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:14,480
and and go to these different places and

732
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:19,070
then I'm anti-social I guess and here I

733
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,690
could do whatever I want and kick

734
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:22,220
people's asses online and they'll never

735
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,540

736
