2
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:11,160
but you are about to see is inspired by

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,530
true events near reading also is there a

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,389
bigger cop-out than inspired by true

5
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:17,220
events not based on a true story

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,570
not these events are entirely fictional

7
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:20,460
pick a fucking lane movie on the night

8
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,579
of February 11th 2005 movie starts off

9
00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:25,050
feeling more like an ID discovery

10
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:26,819
special than an actual movie also if the

11
00:00:26,819 --> 00:00:28,169
movie is going to blatantly rip off the

12
00:00:28,169 --> 00:00:29,699
opening narration of the Texas Chainsaw

13
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:31,499
Massacre couldn't they just go all in

14
00:00:31,499 --> 00:00:32,640
and get John Larroquette to do the

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,320
voiceover was he too busy filming them

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,519
at bride reunion special

17
00:00:35,519 --> 00:00:38,070
according to the FBI there were an

18
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,620
estimated one point four million violent

19
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,199
crimes in America each year and at least

20
00:00:43,199 --> 00:00:45,539
38 percent of them are mask based as you

21
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:48,480
are about to see damn this movie has

22
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,429
more text preamble than a pink Star Wars

23
00:00:50,429 --> 00:00:56,039
movie I know Jordans freaked out and all

24
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:58,109
but this is the least helpful 9-1-1 call

25
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:00,089
ever pronoun game non sequiturs and

26
00:01:00,089 --> 00:01:01,859
unanswered questions about Liv kryla

27
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:03,629
Jesus this movie as long as Vaughn tree

28
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:05,760
ring some dog b95 with the solemn

29
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,200
opening this is a horror movie or a

30
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,790
sequel to Dogville what he follows the

31
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:10,440
sinister rule of horror movie characters

32
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,640
that choose to stand in total darkness

33
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,080
instead of turning on the fucking lights

34
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,700
why did you do all this

35
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,200
the fact that this movie sets up a

36
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,460
tremendous amount of beautiful

37
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,380
exposition with zero dialogue for five

38
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:20,700
minutes at the beginning hammers home

39
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,350
that the opening narration was really

40
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,330
unnecessary so I'm gonna sin that again

41
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:25,950
I know James had planned a super

42
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,660
romantic evening at all but where did he

43
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:29,040
get this number of candles to surround

44
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,990
the tub eating your feelings cliche when

45
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,880
did Kristen light this cigarette we see

46
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,140
the setup of the pack being placed on

47
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,760
the table but there's no time that any

48
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,290
of those scripts are lit up and if never

49
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:38,760
seen again in the scene dude how many

50
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,080
bottles of champagne did you mean for

51
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,340
tonight sure it was supposed to be a

52
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,690
celebration of your love and shit but

53
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:43,620
it's starting to feel like you were

54
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,270
actively planning to get Kristen drunk

55
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:47,340
to make this proposal formal okay the

56
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,200
shaky-cam aesthetic works in theory for

57
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,700
this difficult conversation but it's so

58
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,990
goddamn shaky that I feel like I'm

59
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,190
having a stroke while watching it

60
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,360
this ain't the fucking Bourne Identity

61
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:59,910
dude get a fucking Steadicam content to

62
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,290
let you assume that James is sad and

63
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:02,760
lonely movie hammers it over your head

64
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,880
with a hyper literal Wilco song Fifty

65
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,190
Shades speed men also how do these

66
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,600
assholes not know that they're in a

67
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,130
horror movie having sex in a secluded

68
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:13,700
location with no security system

69
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:17,670
nah walking is tamra here movies biggest

70
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,959
sin might be that we never find out who

71
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,000
the hell Tamara is although since gamma

72
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,040
ward plays doll face here and Tamara and

73
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,510
Pirates of the Caribbean on Stranger

74
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,340
Tides this could mean the strangers is

75
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,170
part of the P otc universe if James

76
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,550
suspected this was the issue with the

77
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,930
light why didn't he try this when the

78
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:32,340
girl was on the front porch after he

79
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,170
haplessly flicked the switch also there

80
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:36,209
are two porch lights so why did fixing

81
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:38,010
one of them get both working so are they

82
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,090
just gonna leave that fucking ice cream

83
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:40,860
out all night like it's probably already

84
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,450
soup at this point and that's Bluebell

85
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,130
not some rinky-dink grocery store Brant

86
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,870
dammit I know you're upset but show some

87
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,459
fucking respect to the Bell Kristen

88
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:48,750
clearly places the needle on the record

89
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,400
at the beginning and we hear the opening

90
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,140
chords of joanna newsom as the sprout in

91
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,670
the bean but this is not the opening

92
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,590
track of any of her records geez Luke

93
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,090
Tyler holds a beer like she's a fucking

94
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:00,060
cowboy at a saloon the strangers

95
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,620
conveniently pick a house with a front

96
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,570
door that possesses neither a people nor

97
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,280
surrounding windows to be spotted prior

98
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,610
to opening it yeah but that shouldn't

99
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:10,260
stop it from beeping right that fucking

100
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,670
thing's on a battery will you just stay

101
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:17,160
on the phone with me James Wow the

102
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,810
masked assholes have perfect timing to

103
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:20,010
cut the phone line even though there's

104
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,090
no way they'd be able to hear what

105
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:27,239
Kristen's saying I guess the power of

106
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:28,620
nicotine addiction is greater than the

107
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,970
power of figuring out why the phone was

108
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:31,350
randomly cut off during a discussion

109
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:32,760
about a potential threat right outside

110
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,380
the door damn it that ice cream is still

111
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,670
sitting out granted this shot is

112
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:38,070
creepiest but what's the mask guys plan

113
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:39,810
here if Kristen does see him I thought

114
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:41,280
he and his crew got their jollies off by

115
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,989
intimidating and scaring their prey if

116
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:44,640
she turns a little as left movies over

117
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,200
apparently part of the plan to be super

118
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,790
creepy involves picking up the SH that

119
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:51,140
Kristen leaves on the floor ah

120
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,340
jumpscares stop it

121
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,140
you just gave us a much creepier visual

122
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,610
a few minutes ago dammit you're better

123
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:59,310
than this movie hate jump-scares

124
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:00,900
Kristen didn't get anywhere near the

125
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,310
record player to make it start again but

126
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,780
it clearly has a dramatic sense of time

127
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,070
there were at least two of the strangers

128
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,180
out there running all around the

129
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,950
property and banging on mere seconds

130
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,690
before James get back in the house how

131
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:14,549
did he not see any of them he's wearing

132
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:16,260
masks yeah but what about the other girl

133
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,160
at the front door

134
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,269
maybe the guy in the back was more

135
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:19,470
terrifying but it would be extremely

136
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:21,299
useful information to tell James that

137
00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:22,289
there's more than one of these assholes

138
00:04:22,289 --> 00:04:24,710
before he goes to hunt them

139
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:27,210
nobody can but Kristen said they were at

140
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:28,500
the door she didn't say they were in the

141
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,490
house yet dickhole

142
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:30,810
I mean it's James literally looking

143
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:32,280
everywhere except the fucking front and

144
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,020
back doors also I guess there is no

145
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,160
reason to turn on an overhead light

146
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,919
during this search she's there who knows

147
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,419
how many windows in this fucking house

148
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:41,310
but doll-faced happens to be standing in

149
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,990
view of the exact one Kristen chooses to

150
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:45,210
look out this exact moment costs

151
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:46,770
actually she looks like a girl with a

152
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:48,479
mask on and nothing like a ghost between

153
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:49,380
this comment and the act of looking

154
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,970
behind the boxes in the garage when

155
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:52,500
Kristen clearly tells James the people

156
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,790
have been outside banging on the windows

157
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,380
it's starting to make sense why Kristen

158
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,880
turned down the proposal one of them

159
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,030
came in here and took my phone Kristen

160
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:02,010
though what did James turn into such a

161
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,870
disbelieving fuck Kristen's statement

162
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,400
about her phone being taken is easily

163
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,780
provable at least one of these killers

164
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,580
went full on Carrie Underwood on James's

165
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,410
car but they didn't hear any of it when

166
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:16,169
they were searching the house this is

167
00:05:16,169 --> 00:05:17,699
super creepy but entirely impossible

168
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:19,530
that James would not see the culprit in

169
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:20,940
the time it takes him to turn around one

170
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,320
minute and seven seconds of speed when

171
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,180
walking followed by 23 seconds of

172
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,949
Speedman staring this movie's tagline

173
00:05:25,949 --> 00:05:27,449
should have been more Speedman than you

174
00:05:27,449 --> 00:05:27,990
can handle

175
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:29,550
why would James use his tie to treat

176
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:31,410
Kristen's hand instead of like any of

177
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:32,880
the towels that are in the house or even

178
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,960
one of the napkins that are in very

179
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,440
close proximity yeah I haven't had a dog

180
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,440
bark karpass first off it's after four

181
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,090
o'clock in the fucking morning so I

182
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:43,080
wouldn't expect a bunch of traffic

183
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,120
second what does this prove did the

184
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,349
strangers kill all the pets in this

185
00:05:46,349 --> 00:05:47,669
neighborhood they obviously didn't put

186
00:05:47,669 --> 00:05:49,229
up roadblocks considering James was able

187
00:05:49,229 --> 00:05:52,590
to run out and get cigarettes wow that

188
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:54,150
crapped it pinup-girl even know they

189
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:55,500
were backing out of the driveway at this

190
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,030
time they didn't have any lights on and

191
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:58,410
they were making very little noise and

192
00:05:58,410 --> 00:05:59,610
she clearly had to come around a corner

193
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:01,110
with the truck so she couldn't see them

194
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,750
get out of the car get out of the car

195
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:10,090
just drive around the truck dumbass

196
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:12,229
whatever the strangers are throwing here

197
00:06:12,229 --> 00:06:13,610
is heavy enough for a series of massive

198
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:15,380
jump scares but not heavy enough to

199
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,940
break the window have they tested the

200
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:19,430
substance before Jesus Christ I know the

201
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,900
strangers love and with people before

202
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,000
they eventually kill them but why what

203
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,110
they taste better if they're properly

204
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:32,810
scared because cops tend to show up when

205
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:34,160
no one has called them despite seeing

206
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,750
all this damage and just being shot at

207
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,550
Mike walks right back up to the house

208
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:39,410
instead of calling the cops first hello

209
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:40,190
Jimmy

210
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,690
Kristen probably would have been super

211
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:43,010
helpful if Mike kept calling out their

212
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:47,360
names once the other's house hello James

213
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,949
clearly isn't a fan if it's always sunny

214
00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:50,630
in philadelphia I know James called Mike

215
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:52,280
earlier and it's always nice to see

216
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,050
Glenn Howerton show up but the Mike

217
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,220
character is clearly written solely

218
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,449
because the movie wants another dead

219
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:57,830
body you take the Mike scene out and

220
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,479
nothing changes there's an already

221
00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:01,370
welcomed barn I'm gonna try and call for

222
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:01,610
help

223
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:03,110
this house has everything you need and

224
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:04,639
the most inconvenient places possible

225
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:05,750
it's as if it was constructed

226
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,160
specifically for a horror movie

227
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,349
Wow The Strangers got their really

228
00:07:09,349 --> 00:07:11,449
specific graffiti up quickly also how

229
00:07:11,449 --> 00:07:12,500
did they know that James would go out

230
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,880
this way after he killed the dude from

231
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:18,080
ap bio dad oh really seems like this

232
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,699
movie is better than a character split

233
00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:20,990
up in a horror movie for no reason

234
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:23,000
cliche but here we are but seriously why

235
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,710
the wouldn't she go with him he's got

236
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:25,970
the fucking gun there were multiple

237
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:27,740
attackers got-damn this part of the

238
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,030
movie bothers me why is he wandering

239
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,470
around the barn with a flashlight

240
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:31,789
they had them surrounded in the house

241
00:07:31,789 --> 00:07:33,320
just a couple minutes ago when exactly

242
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,699
did she think James or Kristen to run

243
00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:35,330
down to the barn

244
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,340
this makes perfect sense to whisper here

245
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,960
when Kristen knows James is at the very

246
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,610
least 20 or 30 feet away from her this

247
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:42,110
movie answers the important question of

248
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:43,460
whatever happened to the unknown comic

249
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,169
Kristen takes off running as if she

250
00:07:45,169 --> 00:07:46,460
knows that nothing interesting has

251
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:49,940
happened for three minutes Oh No Kristen

252
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:53,240
tripped over darkness the fuck are they

253
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,010
doing in there are the strangers busting

254
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:56,330
up some sheep in the house to kill some

255
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:57,470
time while they wait to kill some people

256
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:59,300
considering all these disappearing acts

257
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,770
this movie really only makes sense if

258
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:02,480
the killers are actually fucking ghosts

259
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,680
[Applause]

260
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,090
man between the axe and the door the

261
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:07,560
message scrawled on the windows and the

262
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,180
use of ham radio it's clear this movie

263
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,789
really wants to be the shining seriously

264
00:08:11,789 --> 00:08:13,199
these people have a Casio keyboard

265
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,280
they're running around with set on

266
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:19,740
haunted house sound effects mode totally

267
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,300
get the screw is having fun hang around

268
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,620
with him but why wouldn't they have

269
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,389
already destroyed the radio they've been

270
00:08:24,389 --> 00:08:25,949
in the barn so they knew it was there

271
00:08:25,949 --> 00:08:27,360
and already cut the phone lines and

272
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,800
destroyed their cell phones weird The

273
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,300
Strangers content with the slashed tires

274
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,370
and busted windows setting the fire is

275
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:33,599
more likely to draw some unneeded

276
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,580
attention to this location than say not

277
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,200
setting a fire nobody can't even candle

278
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,430
right earlier in the movie they were

279
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:39,990
clearly only 2 but they've somehow

280
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:42,029
multiplied during the runtime also even

281
00:08:42,029 --> 00:08:43,289
if this is in real time you're telling

282
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:44,970
me that in an hour they haven't burned

283
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:46,890
down any more than that or even gone out

284
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:48,510
considering how wide open the front door

285
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:51,990
is they just now thought to cut the

286
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,459
power isn't that one of the first steps

287
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:55,140
in the murder playbook ok there is no

288
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,520
way that ice cream is anywhere near

289
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:01,260
solid form at this point or a movie 101

290
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,120
lesson why you might not want to trap

291
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,709
yourself in an enclosed space such as a

292
00:09:04,709 --> 00:09:07,760
fucking pantry when hiding from killers

293
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,440
damn for a guy with obvious respiratory

294
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,089
issues Baghead here's done a lot of

295
00:09:12,089 --> 00:09:15,630
unnecessary running around tonight is

296
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:16,500
your home

297
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,360
scariest motive ever on film or lazy

298
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,910
screenwriting hmm don't worry Scott even

299
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,410
though this means you won't be in prey

300
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:23,970
at night there's always a spot for you

301
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:26,370
in 17 underworld sequels and even

302
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:28,050
clinging to life Liv Tyler is sexy as

303
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:29,760
hell is that wrong that's probably wrong

304
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,990
why did they stop to talk to

305
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:32,550
christianmingle.com in the first place

306
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,959
both of these kids probably had enough

307
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:35,370
of a look at doll face to create a

308
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:36,930
convincing police sketch when exactly

309
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:38,250
did the strangers take the time to put

310
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,050
the join and do some record back on the

311
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:41,520
last one they played was Merle Haggard

312
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,200
when Mike walked in I mean these kids

313
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,730
not freaked out in the slightest by all

314
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:46,589
this deadness like I know evangelicals

315
00:09:46,589 --> 00:09:48,570
are weird and he's getting right up into

316
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:53,420
the bodies here with no visible effect

317
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,800
boobie ends on one last jump scare just

318
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,089
in case you made it all this way without

319
00:09:57,089 --> 00:10:01,689
yourself

320
00:10:01,689 --> 00:10:04,279
release the Beast boys let the killing
