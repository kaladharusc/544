hands on this crazy new game Donkey Kong

fond memories of snapping these games

35
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,250
into our super Nintendos hearing that

36
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,530
familiar click and hit me on button then

37
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,540
there and the dead silence a night with

38
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,860
your blanket enveloping you in a

39
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,780
heavenly shroud a comfort you heard that

40
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,870
euphoric jingle for the very first time

from that moment on it was clear it was

45
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,489
obvious it went without saying you

46
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:10,799
didn't play rare where you lived them

47
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:13,290
enter a golden era of video games unlike

48
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:15,150
anything the world had ever seen

49
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,890
stunning new graphics new ways to play

50
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:18,360
and a race to see who can make the

51
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,310
best-looking and most game-changing

52
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:23,099
software it was truly the Wild West whom

53
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:24,930
leading the helm was rare where in their

54
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:26,400
early days they were known for such

55
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,319
games as Battletoads and wizards and

56
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,849
warriors but they didn't hit critical

57
00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:31,680
acclaim until they became a second-party

58
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,390
developer for Nintendo and rocked the

59
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:34,920
world with their Donkey Kong Country

60
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,290
line of games taming would never again

61
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:39,780
be the same it was no longer about your

62
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,849
high score it was about the adventure

63
00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:43,739
and rare new this they knew it better

64
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:45,989
than the rest of us and that's when

65
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:49,530
things got crazy Donkey Kong Country 2

66
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,780
city's conquest in Donkey Kong Country 3

67
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,849
Dixie Kong's Double Trouble think on

68
00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:55,560
racing plastic or Killer Instinct

69
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,150
old-line double-oh-seven Donkey Kong 64

70
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:04,430
perfect that's the thing that was so

71
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,840
seriously no pun intended rare about

72
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,370
rare where is that they were like the

73
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:10,560
Beatles of video games they could take

74
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,260
on seemingly any genre of gaming and set

75
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,579
Babar while they were at it

76
00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:16,320
their lineup from the early 90s to the

77
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,000
year 2000 was something I can only

78
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,900
describe is oh it's sublime sky blight

79
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:25,800
is good but we're forgetting someone

80
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,770
aren't we aren't we that's right you

81
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,150
didn't think I could possibly overlook

82
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:32,370
banjo kazooie did you I mean look at the

83
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:34,860
look at the title of the video it's

84
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,690
probably gonna mention it what's so

85
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:38,789
great about banjo kazooie you ask huh

86
00:04:38,789 --> 00:04:40,500
well I'm just not even sure I could put

87
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,840
it into words but I sure as hell can try

88
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,910
ever just looked across a misty

89
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,099
shoreline gazed over beyond the horizon

90
00:04:47,099 --> 00:04:48,870
and said to yourself

91
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,850
if there you go you need further

92
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:52,890
explains do you need Claire do mom do

93
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:54,420
you need clear every single part of the

94
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,710
game was packed to the brim with

95
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:58,530
originality and content sure it was a

96
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:00,390
collectathon if you will but I still

97
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,800
don't get why this is considered a

98
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,600
derogatory thing when referring to games

99
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,000
yes it is a game where you collect

100
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,920
things but the game is built around it

101
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,910
so it's fine

102
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:10,740
each collectible is ingeniously hidden

103
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,000
within different parts of the level and

104
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,710
the best part about finding them is you

105
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:15,570
have to survey the landscape and locate

106
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:17,130
them by the sea to your own way

107
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:18,810
there's no way points Kate it's not like

108
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:20,940
Bob Oh team bear and bird meet us about

109
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,500
the point there's none of that and of

110
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,060
course it must be said that banjo

111
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,070
kazooie had a freaking awesome sequel

112
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:28,350
called banjo tooie it's pretty dang rare

113
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:30,270
yeah there it is again when you're

114
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:32,070
graced with a sequel of that quality in

115
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:35,130
size but then something terrible

116
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:37,770
happened a misstep on the stairway to

117
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:41,070
glory in the year 2002 rare where in its

118
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:43,310
entirety was purchased by Microsoft

119
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,720
Corporation they started making games

120
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,310
like grabbed by the Ghoulies perfect

121
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:49,230
dark zero and cameo elements of power

122
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:52,350
and it's fuzzy but I could swear that I

123
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:55,320
remember something else something far

124
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,140
more sinister well we can't play the new

125
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:58,740
one

126
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,780
Jacque then I guess we might as well

127
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,370
just play the old one it's the next best

128
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:13,850
thing

138
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:21,450

[Music]

142
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,539
is banjo-kazooie nuts-and-bolts it's

143
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:32,699
sort of a bittersweet feeling seeing the

144
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:34,199
rareware logo again after all these

145
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:40,439
years you hear that jingle right there

146
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:43,289
and that's the stuff I have it look its

147
00:07:43,289 --> 00:07:45,180
spiral Mountain good to see you again

148
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:48,270
old friend mountains can't be friends

149
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:50,249
so we're met with a familiar menu screen

150
00:07:50,249 --> 00:07:51,990
but it's a little different than before

151
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:53,520
for starters looks like banjo has become

152
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,319
a bit of a hoarder huh I guess those

153
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:57,719
were all the Xbox's he had that red ring

154
00:07:57,719 --> 00:08:00,120
whoa they're all about to topple over

155
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,569
but they never do so let's do the deed

156
00:08:03,569 --> 00:08:10,189
and start up the single-player campaign

157
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:12,750
set Battletoads in the background

158
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,770
[Music]

159
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:18,719
nice touch so the game starts off with a

160
00:08:18,719 --> 00:08:20,370
bit of a retrospective it tells the tale

161
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:22,740
of banjo kazooie ins gruntilda and shows

162
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,719
the games that came before overcoming

163
00:08:24,719 --> 00:08:26,909
many perils and speech impediments to

164
00:08:26,909 --> 00:08:32,089
send gruntilda tumbling to her doom o

165
00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:34,979
Conker's Bad Fur Day music we get it

166
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:36,690
rare where you used to be cool didn't

167
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:37,620
can you get on with it

168
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:45,480
stop oh geez oh darn it they got fat so

169
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,519
this radio here tells Banjo and Kazooie

170
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,170
that it's been 10 years since they were

171
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:50,699
invented it and if they're all fat and

172
00:08:50,699 --> 00:08:54,660
washed-up hmm can you feel that can you

173
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,019
feel it

174
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:56,940
this kind of reminds me of the beginning

175
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,890
of Conker's Bad Fur Day except instead

176
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:00,839
of being funny it's just banjo telling

177
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:01,920
us over and over they should have

178
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,170
ordered a small pizza I'm fucking

179
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:08,910
serious look at his show begin yes ok ok

180
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:09,660
small pizza

181
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,570
why you always be tell me this oh I'm in

182
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:15,420
trash how did I get them so they meet up

183
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,699
with runty again and it's like old times

184
00:09:17,699 --> 00:09:21,329
oh shit here we go the fuck I didn't

185
00:09:21,329 --> 00:09:23,250
pause I didn't fucking pause the game

186
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:26,190
and unfiltered comic sans oh I guess it

187
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,720
was Tweedledum over here who did it so

188
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,640
this guy calls himself the Lord of games

189
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:33,180
or a log yeah this game reminds me of

190
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,910
some certain kinds of blogs like one

191
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:38,320
your name is odd and cute

192
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,350
a bit queer you gotta understand she's

193
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:43,330
from a different era man this sure does

194
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:44,950
follow up on the spirit of banjo kazooie

195
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:47,620
games subtly breaking the fourth wall if

196
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:54,610
you spell subtly like this now then in

197
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:56,950
line with your banjo tradition your

198
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:58,930
challenge will consist of collecting as

199
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:01,930
many pointless objects as possible

200
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:07,470
whoa whoa whoa you just hold on a second

201
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:10,180
because banjo kazooie was totally this

202
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:13,750
Demian oh shit no no no it's too painful

203
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,520
to watch yeah you got that part right

204
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,070
gamers today don't want all this they

205
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:21,280
just want to shoot things but as we're

206
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,530
broadening the demographic I'll have to

207
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:25,840
think of something original something

208
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:29,980
original huh broadening the demographic

209
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:32,250
all right all right

210
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:35,550
what exactly did you guys have in mind

211
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:44,740
[Music]

212
00:10:44,740 --> 00:11:03,230
cars I can sit here and we shovel shit

213
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:06,740
all day but no one no one can tell me

214
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:10,130
that anyone anywhere this was an okay

215
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:13,970
thing to do why why would you take a

216
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:16,610
fucking banjo kazooie gay why don't we

217
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,800
been waiting for four years and make it

218
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,570
about fucking Lego cars no I must come

219
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:25,370
myself let me go ahead and try to

220
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:27,860
explain this how do you say very well

221
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,649
justified rage let's go back to the

222
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:32,480
roots of the problem and maybe if you

223
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,610
don't already see it the way I do you

224
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:37,190
might just change your mind flashback to

225
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:38,269
the year 2000

226
00:11:38,269 --> 00:11:39,890
you just beat banjo tooie and you hear

227
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:41,930
gruntilda say those beautiful words you

228
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:45,110
just wait until banjo 3 flash forward to

229
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:48,110
late 2006 six whole years after the

230
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:50,149
release of banjo tooie fans of the

231
00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:51,709
series were graced with something

232
00:11:51,709 --> 00:11:53,839
wonderful to hold on to something that

233
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,520
made the coming years look brighter than

234
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,760
ever the real next gen banjo kazooie

235
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,950
gave her secret wishes were finally

236
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:03,440
realized we were once again privileged

237
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,600
to experience that loss genre video

238
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,570
gaming's adolescence a new baby budget

239
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:11,630
3d platforming game banjos coming back

240
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:14,540
baby and we were happier than ever only

241
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:16,880
do you see anything wrong here I don't

242
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,610
know about you but I don't see any car

243
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:22,459
what boats or planes all I see is the

244
00:12:22,459 --> 00:12:27,290
promise of something so beautiful oh I

245
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:30,500
got a kids to look at anymore so here we

246
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,880
are at showdown town

247
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,860
crate looks more like a bad custom

248
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,060
counter-strike meth

249
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:37,399
oh good I get to move around finally oh

250
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:42,290
good a tutorial on car part

251
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:47,029
oh you know you're doing something wrong

252
00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:48,709
with your game if the first three hours

253
00:12:48,709 --> 00:12:51,440
isn't menus good I just did put a make

254
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,959
it make a car I don't want to kill

255
00:12:53,959 --> 00:12:56,089
myself right now this is a sin this is a

256
00:12:56,089 --> 00:12:58,490
truce in an ultimate crime against the

257
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:01,009
entire gaming community I mean what if

258
00:13:01,009 --> 00:13:02,959
after Super Mario World Nintendo came

259
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:04,490
out with a teaser trailer for Super

260
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:06,769
Mario 64 and upon release day you were

261
00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:08,779
greeted with Mario train simulator and

262
00:13:08,779 --> 00:13:10,220
then you turned on the game and jiguro

263
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,630
Miyamoto's toast comes out like a

264
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,490
fucking who likes yo Mario games am i

265
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:15,399
right

266
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:17,779
so pretty much their level gates all

267
00:13:17,779 --> 00:13:19,519
around almost exactly like mario

268
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,709
sunshine like i said pretty much exactly

269
00:13:21,709 --> 00:13:25,970
uh what do i do no seriously what do i

270
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:26,269
do

271
00:13:26,269 --> 00:13:29,480
nah no seriously what do i cum fucking

272
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,610
theory ladies and gentlemen I've plucked

273
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:33,470
a whale from the ocean and he sounds

274
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:41,630
like a seal so seriously this is just

275
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,940
one big empty level with nothing to do

276
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:46,040
in it I eventually found out that you

277
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,779
gotta talk to people to unlock missions

278
00:13:47,779 --> 00:13:50,120
where you can actually do things so why

279
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,010
then can I walk around this giant

280
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:54,410
wasteland this feels more empty than

281
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:57,529
Fallout 3 a game that's supposed to feel

282
00:13:57,529 --> 00:13:59,779
empty I swear to god it feels like I'm

283
00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:01,490
playing a game that wasn't finished I

284
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:03,980
know there's missions but why this is a

285
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,410
banjo-kazooie game it's about the

286
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:08,690
adventure and fine if you're gonna make

287
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:11,240
it a car game fine but why make this

288
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,240
overworld that has absolutely nothing in

289
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,730
it let me guess is it perchance because

290
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,889
the last games had over worlds that had

291
00:14:18,889 --> 00:14:21,769
things in them is that why if you're

292
00:14:21,769 --> 00:14:23,240
trying to live on your predecessor

293
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,939
success that's fine but you can't change

294
00:14:25,939 --> 00:14:28,459
the game mechanics and still keep the

295
00:14:28,459 --> 00:14:32,300
old level design that makes no sense but

296
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,680
I'll tell you what does make a little

297
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,510
bit of sense to me now I can't prove it

298
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:37,220
and I haven't read anything confirming

299
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,259
it but consider this the intuition of a

300
00:14:39,259 --> 00:14:41,089
seasoned veteran of the early videogame

301
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:43,339
industry based on this old trailer and

302
00:14:43,339 --> 00:14:45,019
these barren levels it would seem to me

303
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:47,420
that banjo kazooie nuts-and-bolts was

304
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:50,080
actually going to be banjo 3 at some

305
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,240
point like I said I can't prove it but

306
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,570
it would make this Oh makes sense and

307
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:57,220
you know what if they had gone through

308
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,180
with it I bet it would have been a

309
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,040
decently good game I mean I don't know

310
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,090
if it would have lived up to the

311
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:02,860
originals but the assets are all here

312
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,330
the graphics are pretty appealing

313
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:06,340
everything is stylized and banjo

314
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:08,380
actually controls pretty satisfyingly on

315
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,880
the ground and I'm not kidding the

316
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,710
atmosphere in some places is actually

317
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:13,690
pretty fantastic the real part of the

318
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:15,310
game is boring I don't even kid do you

319
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:15,820
care

320
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,670
you fucking kid I don't care maybe I can

321
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:20,260
end the game early by killing gruntilda

322
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:24,190
while she's in the open yeah seriously

323
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,450
this aint funny anymore this is now

324
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:27,280
called Rob Tron even though you may not

325
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,560
believe this I hate the fact that I have

326
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,900
to hate this game in an era where

327
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,550
developers are pissed scared to make a

328
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:35,860
tiptoe outside the proverbial box it's

329
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,300
actually nice to see something with a
