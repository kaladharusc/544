00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,840
we are on a family trip to Los Angeles

3
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,910
where I'll be attending VidCon maybe

4
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,689
seeing my in-laws this videos gonna

5
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:23,910
start a little experiment wherein I try

6
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,950
to get my new boosted mini on an

7
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:29,400
airplane my theory here is that the

8
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,779
reason why they don't allow these is

9
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:33,330
because of the battery so I'm gonna try

10
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:35,820
to circumvent that rule by removing the

11
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,800
battery taking the battery in the

12
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,590
skateboard on separate

17
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,800
sorry right now I'm putting my odds at

18
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,810
about 50/50 of this skateboard comes

19
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:10,540
