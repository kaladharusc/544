I missed it a lot but I want to explain

14
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:36,170
why the thinking behind starting this

15
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:38,470
thing up again

16
00:01:38,470 --> 00:02:03,400

18
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,530
hi guys welcome

19
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:14,040
it's raining out now exactly two years

20
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:20,939
ago to the day 365 times to 730 days ago

21
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:25,980
exactly today is March 25th 2015 was

22
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,069
when I shot the very first episode of

23
00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:33,329
the vlog ever I know that it was my 34th

24
00:02:33,329 --> 00:02:35,400
birthday and it's also my 34th birthday

25
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,989
today is my 36th birthday today so four

26
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:43,290
days ago Monday of this week I posted a

27
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:45,959
vlog episode and I need you to get on

28
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:47,790
Tuesday and then Wednesday and Thursday

29
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,470
I didn't even call them vlogs I just

30
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,310
posted them

31
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,109
I didn't address it in those episodes

32
00:02:52,109 --> 00:02:53,730
what I was doing because it was an

33
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:56,579
experiment and I have to tell you it

34
00:02:56,579 --> 00:02:59,639
felt great and then when I think back to

35
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:01,980
why I stopped like the frustration that

36
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,739
I felt and you know what I explained

37
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:07,139
right when I ended the vlog was it it

38
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:10,019
had gotten like easy and what I meant by

39
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:11,700
that is the creative challenge which is

40
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,220
what I love the most I kind of faded and

41
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,440
I spent a couple months thinking about

42
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,690
sort of what that meant to me

43
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:22,349
and I landed at a couple of places one

44
00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:26,010
it was like before I didn't see an end

45
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:27,720
to the vlog it was just like this thing

46
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,569
that I was doing and that I don't know

47
00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:32,609
it it sort of felt like treading water

48
00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:35,010
versus swimming like to a destination

49
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:39,000
and I realized that the impetus the

50
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,040
reason why I originally started the vlog

51
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,889
two years ago was so I could share with

52
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:45,060
an audience

53
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,819
my company beam like what it meant to

54
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:50,250
start up a company to maybe build an

55
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,540
audience that might be excited about

56
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,400
what I was doing and then you guys would

57
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,129
actually use the product we were making

58
00:03:55,129 --> 00:03:58,430
and that worked and it was awesome and

59
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,930
you know like the first year pretty much

60
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:04,079
of the vlog so much of it was about my

61
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:08,459
career beyond YouTube and that was a big

62
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:10,889
driving force and as beams started to

63
00:04:10,889 --> 00:04:12,959
like drift away as the company started

64
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,359
to struggle it became less and less of

65
00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:17,609
this show and instead this just became

66
00:04:17,609 --> 00:04:19,620
like this here's my day here's what I'm

67
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,540
doing trying to

68
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:23,450
and it became very routine but I've

69
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:25,400
spent the last I've spent the last four

70
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,740
months figuring out what this new

71
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,690
company what this new project what this

72
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:31,730
whole new thing is that I'm building

73
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:34,730
with CNN and I wanted to announce it on

74
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:37,460
the YouTube channel but it never felt

75
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,720
right so it's not like we're doing this

76
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,010
we're not like doing a show we're not

77
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:42,890
just building an app the company still

78
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:44,330
called bean but the company that we're

79
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:46,790
building is much more like a lab like a

80
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:49,280
laboratory where we we try different

81
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,800
apps we build different software we make

82
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,210
different shows we're gonna start a

83
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,400
YouTube channel we're gonna it's a whole

84
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,710
bunch of stuff and the more I thought

85
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:59,480
about like how am I going to share with

86
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,910
my audience what exactly I'm doing and

87
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:05,380
then it was like I was like holy

88
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:08,960
this is the exact same this is the exact

89
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,570
same thought process that predicated me

90
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:14,690
starting the vlog in the first place so

91
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:17,360
here I am exactly two years later

92
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,330
starting another company and all of a

93
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:23,570
sudden I feel like I have a purpose to

94
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:26,300
do this again and that's like wow that's

95
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,070
crazy exciting for me that makes me feel

96
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:32,240
so good you know one criticism of the

97
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,460
vlog that I never understood was people

98
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,410
were like Casey I feel like you're just

99
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:38,720
doing the vlog so you can tell us about

100
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,060
your company and I didn't understand

101
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,010
that as a criticism because that is the

102
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,260
main reason why I started the vlog and

103
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,480
that is the reason that I'm most proud

104
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,370
that is the aspect of the vlog that I'm

105
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:52,220
most proud to share with you I love

106
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,350
making videos I love sharing my life but

107
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:56,150
I also have a really big career and

108
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:57,290
something I'm super passionate about

109
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,620
beyond YouTube and having a vlog as a

110
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:03,260
way to share those other interests of

111
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:06,200
mine it's a huge it's a huge source of

112
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,700
motivation for me

113
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,650
and then the

114
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,300
