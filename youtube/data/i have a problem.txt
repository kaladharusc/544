16
00:01:17,179 --> 00:01:21,020
you in the spring of 2015 in one of the

17
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,690

coffee machine and this began mail time

20
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,239
this is a really funny book by the way

21
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:48,979
couple years it all falls into one of

22
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:51,440
two categories first category is

23
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,270
companies small companies big companies

24
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:56,660
companies like shred lights they're

25
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:59,030
sending me free products like lights cuz

26
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:01,459
they want me to talk about their company

27
00:02:01,459 --> 00:02:03,289
and what their products are the second

28
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,879
kind of mail that I get and this is my

29
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:07,399

30
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:09,500

94
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,530
letters in the box or somebody sends me

95
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:50,180
a big present or a small present or just

96
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,640
a note that says hello every single

97

reference for all of eternity

103
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:07,820
I appreciate every single thing that's

104
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,710
ever been sent to me but I still find

105
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,330
myself in a position of extreme

106
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:16,970
abundance to have an abundance of food

107
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:19,730
and snacks because I eat all the candy

108
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:20,990
and then whatever weird stuff that I

109
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:24,680
don't want I just give to Oscar hey hey

110
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:35,540
man is Oscar in so I find myself in this

111
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,640
position of trying to figure out what to

112
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:41,810
do with all of this stuff and you know

113
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:43,610
living in New York City space is a

114
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,470
premium here and it's like I don't want

115
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,730
to get rid of anything because I

116
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:49,070
appreciate it so much for the same time

117
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,810
it's just kind of sitting in my office

118
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:52,550
over there that I'm paying rent on

119
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:55,190
that's collecting dust so what should I

120
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:58,850
do is the million dollar here Casey we

121
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:01,280

125
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,770

126
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:19,380
[Music]

127
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:23,320
as come on now in the past I have

128
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,000
donated some of the toys to charities

129
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,860
who give toys to kids I've donated a

130
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,390
bunch of the clothes to places where you

131
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,220
can donate clothing and then what I

132
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,600
really like to do is when somebody I

133
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,700
know or sort of know needs something I

134
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,220
just send them all this extra stuff

135
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:39,250
okay seen I said and told him about my

136
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,020
nonprofit heroes reading heroes

137
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:43,660
Tomasz blown up hashtag grenade legs I'm

138
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,490

139
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:48,340
nice that decided to send me Chris was a

140
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:51,040
US soldier knee at his legs blown up in

141
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,840
Iraq he wants to make youtube videos but

142
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,370
isn't have any camera gear so I sent him

143
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:56,470
a whole box of stuff and a lot of that

144
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:57,850
stuff and a lot of it was stuff that

145
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,560
people had sent me that I wasn't using

146
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,540
so I was able to pass on to him so I'm

147
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,740
looking for something that's more

148
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:05,640
scalable that does something good that

149
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:10,690
here's what I came up with all right so

150
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:12,760
here here's the plan

151
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,800
I'm going to be launching an eBay store

152
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,110
do you call an eBay store an eBay I'm

153
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:19,600
gonna sell everything that everyone's

154
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,850
ever sent me that I don't have a use for

155
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:24,550
or someone else I can give it to then

156
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:26,500
I'm gonna take all those proceeds and I

157
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,330
mean every penny like every cent that's

158
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:29,800
leftover that we didn't use on shipping

159
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,020
every cent and I'm gonna give it all to

160
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:35,320
whatever nonprofit I feel needs it the

161
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,520
most at any given

162
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,490
the current situation I have too much

163
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:43,500
male stuff the answer the current

164
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,690
situation is to store all the stuff in

165
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:48,620
garbage bags this accomplishes

166
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:51,360
absolutely nothing now the new way

167
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,940
current situation the same too much male

168
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,190
stuff but the answer is to sell it on

169
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:58,830
ebay what does this accomplish well the

170
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:01,949
stuff this stuff goes to people who will

171
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:02,849
actually use it

172
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:04,560
instead of just store it like me and

173
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,750
then the proceeds the proceeds will help

174
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,360
those in the most need via charities and

175
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,280
things like that so for this first run

176
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,720
of stuff that I'm going to sell all the

177
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,250
proceeds for that are gonna go to a

178
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,870
couple of charities all linked below

179
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,520
all of which are currently helping

180
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,680
people in Puerto Rico just ravaged by a

181
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,900
hurricane three plus million people

182
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,150
without power down there they're in the

183
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:28,740
most need right now so I'm going to

184
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,659
donate all the cash made from selling

185
00:08:30,659 --> 00:08:32,969
all this stuff to help those people I

186
00:08:32,969 --> 00:08:34,440

187
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,479

204
00:09:37,529 --> 00:09:39,950
the skateboard

205
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,600
[Music]

206
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,949
hey old life expectations Oscar I mean

207
00:09:46,949 --> 00:09:48,810
based on the hallway test I think we're

208
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:51,120
I'm excited to see how this thing goes

209
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,399
on the outside so what folds up yeah I

210
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:54,509
don't know much about I couldn't find

211
00:09:54,509 --> 00:10:03,040
the manual top speed don't know

212
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,270
it's turning ability supply

213
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:10,750
oh geez I guess the question becomes

214
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,000
Oscar could you see this as a viable

215
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,820
means of transportation in New York City

216
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:19,480
I feel vulnerable on it I feel a little

217
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,820
anxious about hurting someone else for

218
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,320
the right kind of person you know if

219
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,540
you're maybe not is like you don't enjoy

220
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,100
the exercise that comes along with a

221
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:30,720
bike it might work

222
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:38,499
[Music]

223
00:10:38,499 --> 00:10:40,850
my biggest beef is there's nowhere to

224
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,860
put your feet I think that's what this

225
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,870
is for your feet are supposed to go here

226
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:47,060
but they don't really organically fall

227
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,829
there let's look at some of the features

228
00:10:48,829 --> 00:10:51,050
of this thing the center stand here

229
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:54,170

230

suspension up front LED display here new

232
00:10:58,939 --> 00:11:00,350
york sides it's something you could've

233
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:02,990
in your apartment I mean if I look half

234
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:04,910
as cool as I feel Oscar this thing seems

235
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:07,279

236
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:07,460
