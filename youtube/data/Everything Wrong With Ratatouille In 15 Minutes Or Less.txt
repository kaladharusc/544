1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:10,860
we French know the truth the best food

2
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,840
in the world is met in Homs Franco

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,639
philic propaganda is scored by an

4
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,349
overture about Russia's victory over the

5
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:18,599
French army confused yet also animal

6
00:00:18,599 --> 00:00:21,239
narration first of all I'm a rat which

7
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:24,300
means life is hard that's rat system I

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,309
have a highly developed sense of taste

9
00:00:26,309 --> 00:00:27,720
and smell but what is it that led to

10
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,729
Remy's nose being so good it can't be

11
00:00:29,729 --> 00:00:31,380
his love of food alone it has to be a

12
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,149
genetic reason or explanation right

13
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:35,250
turns out that funny smell was rat

14
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,199
poison suddenly dad didn't think my

15
00:00:37,199 --> 00:00:39,359
talent was useless I agree that it was

16
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:40,980
sudden it was only 30 seconds ago that

17
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,030
you were telling me about your talent

18
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,469
and your dad not respecting it now here

19
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:45,539
we are and yes that was fast we gotta

20
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:48,839
cook this now exactly how we cook this

21
00:00:48,839 --> 00:00:50,609
is the real question

22
00:00:50,609 --> 00:00:52,589
where are the rats only hanging around

23
00:00:52,589 --> 00:00:54,300
this warm house is it really enough to

24
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,280
sustain an entire colony how the hell is

25
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,809
this one elderly woman producing so much

26
00:00:57,809 --> 00:00:59,909
garbage you think that maybe we

27
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:02,879
shouldn't be so mother nature goes could

28
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,439
easily and these rats get blasted off a

29
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:05,970
roof and into the plot propelling

30
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:08,310
situation also holy they survived that

31
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:11,490
she's gonna wake up these guys tasted a

32
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:12,899
thing and then decided it needed only

33
00:01:12,899 --> 00:01:15,060
saffron to be perfect then realized this

34
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,610
lady had saffron I think then decided to

35
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,259
steal her saffron so they could

36
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:21,329
experience the perfect bite and honestly

37
00:01:21,329 --> 00:01:22,920
this convoluted reasoning is flimsier

38
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,649
than most Bugs Bunny cartoons you read

39
00:01:25,649 --> 00:01:27,329
not sure if I should be more shocked at

40
00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:28,920
Remy reading or the brother only just

41
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,659
now realizing Remy can read or even

42
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:32,460
knowing what reading is and the duck a

43
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,009
hot head chef died shortly afterwards he

44
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:36,479
got his first bad review then literally

45
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,700
died from it how sensitive was this dude

46
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,530
I've gotten hundreds of thousands of bad

47
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,360
reviews a few dozen hate mails and two

48
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,770
separate hand-drawn maps leading me to

49
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,390
dangerous locations but none of them has

50
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:48,000
caused me to die as sadness somehow

51
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,380
pulling the trigger on this gun opens

52
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,850
the umbrella that's stuck in the barrel

53
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:52,350
because movie frequently forgets out of

54
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,780
physics also seriously the sight of a

55
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,520
couple rats causes granny to immediately

56
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,689
reach for the shotgun she'd rather

57
00:01:57,689 --> 00:01:59,399
destroy her house at a rain of fire than

58
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:00,899
say grab a broom

59
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:02,759
Dan this old lady gun stores more

60
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:04,259
impossible shells than an action movie

61
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:07,130
villain

62
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:09,450
if these rats were all living in this

63
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:11,130
woman's attic before now that was not

64
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:13,620
made clear so Remy felt his dish needed

65
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,270
saffron and he robbed the old lady's

66
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,710
house for which caused a chain reaction

67
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,390
that led to the entire rat clan being

68
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,040
washed away all the way to Paris and

69
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,570
none of that has ever addressed again

70
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:22,740
the movie wanted to get everyone to

71
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,270
Paris and decided to show it to us but

72
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,890
it meant nothing no one is mad at Remy

73
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:26,940
when they meet up later on

74
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,740
everyone adjusts fine to Paris I suppose

75
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:29,910
the old lady was snatched up by the e

76
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,230
u--'s version of Medicaid and was

77
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,880
probably lost or killed via negligence

78
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,200
but this whole opening is pretty

79
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,880
meaningless how the hell is that book

80
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,710
readable after taking that long-ass trip

81
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,840
in the storm sewer my copy of Fifty

82
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,220
Shades of Grey was ruined after I walked

83
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:45,120
through the ring for one block holy did

84
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,680
movie just seriously yada-yada this

85
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,850
confrontation at gunpoint

86
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,320
is this a regular occurrence in Paris

87
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,600
man Francis weird the sequence of the

88
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,100
camera following Remy as he explores

89
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,260
Paris is awesome really worthy of a sin

90
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,940
removal but it makes me wonder how the

91
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,500
hell Remy knows exactly where to go at

92
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,060
all times when I'm ever stopping to see

93
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,940
which way to turn all this time

94
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:05,040
underneath Harris movie inadvertently

95
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,810
writes the most salacious Gilmore Girls

96
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,730
fan fiction ever also luckily for Remy

97
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,440
on the plot he emerged directly on a

98
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,030
perfect view of the city to confirm his

99
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,470
location I mean it's better than an

100
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,959
obvious title card but still to Stowe's

101
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:18,450
you've led me to your restaurant

102
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:20,910
lottery odds I mean here is a rat that

103
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,860
loves Gusteau's cookbooks and suddenly

104
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,690
finds himself swept into Paris and right

105
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,580
to the doorstep of Gusteau's and this is

106
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,110
so unrealistic that Justice League must

107
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,820
a scheme sent a congratulatory fruit

108
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:33,810
basket I was my mother she died that's

109
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,070
right kids we've killed off two

110
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:36,330
characters in the first 20 minutes of

111
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:38,130
this movie Jesus even died hard didn't

112
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:39,930
have this body count so soon you've read

113
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:42,000
my book left to see how much you know

114
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,450
huh

115
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:45,000
which one easy shape this entire scene

116
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,440
of Remy identifying all the various

117
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,150
kitchen workers all very important is

118
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,340
purely expositional later on this ghost

119
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,810
is gonna tell Remy he's not real and

120
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,370
Remy is talking to himself so he's just

121
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:54,870
proving to himself here how smart he is

122
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,190
but mostly he's letting the audience

123
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:58,019
know movie notwithstanding it takes a

124
00:03:58,019 --> 00:03:59,640
kitchen full of employees ignoring an

125
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,170
entire station for several minutes in

126
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:02,670
order for this magical plot propelling

127
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:04,200
soup to even begin to get made in the

128
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,970
first place which is even more damning

129
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:07,230
since Remy pointed out that this was a

130
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:08,730
saucier his workstation where does

131
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:11,220
saucier go huh extended cigarette break

132
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,830
no wait this is France also linguini

133
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,359
grabs this piping hot pot of soup with

134
00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:16,980
no ill effects I guess he does have

135
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,690
talent in the kitchen I mean I could say

136
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:20,010
this at virtually any point in this

137
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:20,430
movie

138
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,229
but how do all these assholes not notice

139
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:24,000
this obvious rat and a scene gets

140
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,620
dangerously close to a bad Tom and Jerry

141
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:33,900
episode some rat dude all and Queenie

142
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,729
did was add some water garlic and leeks

143
00:04:35,729 --> 00:04:37,259
to the soup so why is it immediately

144
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:39,479
nauseating without so this act is

145
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,160
meaningless even more so for rats than

146
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,710
humans rats carry the plague guys he

147
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,360
dumps that entire container of broth

148
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,100
into his soup without any spills or

149
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,210
issues even though the movie already

150
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:50,039
showed this soup was nearing the top of

151
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:51,330
its container and would definitely

152
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:52,770
overflow if a gallon of broth were

153
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:55,370
poured on it

154
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:58,979
what are you playing act I'd like to

155
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:00,270
point out that this guy is basically the

156
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,889
primary villain in this movie but even

157
00:05:01,889 --> 00:05:03,630
he just immediately admits and accepts

158
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,490
at this soup is wrath and a true asshole

159
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:06,599
would have called it disgusting and

160
00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:07,770
refused to ever let Lin Greene cook

161
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,690
again instead this guy knows the super

162
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:11,280
rules but he can't accept the fact that

163
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,900
linguini cooked it because he didn't

164
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,460
this guy gets a bad rap I'm sending this

165
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,690
movie for not making this villain more

166
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,220
villainy also I'm pretty sure a simple

167
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,780
security camera would solve almost all

168
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,789
this movies conflict saucier would get

169
00:05:20,789 --> 00:05:22,259
fired for abandoning his station and

170
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:23,849
linguini would keep his job as garbage

171
00:05:23,849 --> 00:05:25,470
boy once everyone saw the rat was the

172
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:26,820
one that messed with the soup done and

173
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,419
done

174
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:29,070
this is a modern movie right and one of

175
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,240
the most famous high-end expensive

176
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,520
restaurants in Paris but no cameras not

177
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,080
even to safeguard the expensive wines

178
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,360
and other high-end ingredients

179
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,750
responsibly

180
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,639
I guess linguini trained at the esteemed

181
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,300
Mario Batali culinary school it's this

182
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,770
how you keep a restaurant at four stars

183
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:45,690
there's literally only a swinging

184
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:46,979
Dumbledore separating you and the

185
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:48,720
customers and you are screaming wait

186
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,699
when did he punch a triangular air hole

187
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:52,710
in this lid and why and does he just

188
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:54,630
carry a can opener on his person at all

189
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,220
times have you been nodding

190
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,960
Remi can understand English but he can't

191
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,729
speak and we're all speaking English

192
00:05:59,729 --> 00:06:01,259
even though were in Paris movie

193
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:02,550
yada-yada is over the solution to the

194
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:03,960
language barrier here so hard that even

195
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,520
six-year-olds came out asking their

196
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,840
parents what the hell was going on I

197
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,220
can't cook

198
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:11,039
Canha awesome so we've immediately

199
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,210
undermined the central premise of the

200
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:13,860
movie by determining our secondary

201
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,780
protagonist is unable to do what gusto

202
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,729
says anyone can do hey they like the

203
00:06:17,729 --> 00:06:21,690
soap they like the soup

204
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:23,220
linguini fell into the goddamn Seine

205
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,780
River survived it found the jar that

206
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,490
Remi was in rescued him and climbed out

207
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:28,320
of the Seine in record time why can't we

208
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,539
see that story this uncoordinated asshat

209
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:32,250
keeps losing jobs and can't do anything

210
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,820
and has no money and lives

211
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,140
this tiny cramped apartment and you

212
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,220
expect me to believe he takes up

213
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,690
valuable kitchen shelf space with a

214
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:40,360
goddamn soccer ball okay back the beep

215
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,480
beep beep this whole apartment has this

216
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,580
view and this failure of a citizen can

217
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,750
afford it good thing they both got a

218
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,070
good night's sleep last night instead of

219
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,540
trying to figure out any sort of plan

220
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,490
for pulling off the ruse today we ate

221
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:55,120
the soup take as much time as you need

222
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,090
oh we couldn't Skinner just a man the

223
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:59,620
recipe or if he wanted to keep linguini

224
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,850
honest wouldn't just stand here and

225
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:01,990
watch him make it this is the culinary

226
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:03,640
version of a Bond villain leaving him to

227
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:08,460
die without doing it himself

228
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,840
no one overhears linguini screaming at

229
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,310
the top of his lungs about the rat he

230
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:13,690
brought into the restaurant and before

231
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:15,010
you say that he's in the walk-in and it

232
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:16,360
would be soundproof I'll remind you the

233
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,470
Jack Torrance was able to easily

234
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,150
communicate with multiple people outside

235
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:20,500
of it in the shiny I'm just

236
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,230
familiarizing myself with vegetables

237
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:27,340
what'd I get you know this is actually a

238
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,780
pretty good adult joke suddenly thrown

239
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,190
into a kid's movie but it also means

240
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,630
that at some point Skinner definitely

241
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:33,220
stuck a cucumber up his ass the whole

242
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,840
rest of the movie kind of hinges on this

243
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,610
but this is a bullet if something

244
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:38,020
suddenly pulled two strands of your hair

245
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,430
the last thing you would do is raise

246
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,990
both arms in unison with said hair

247
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:43,120
strands this takes so long to learn I'm

248
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,290
surprised it's not snowing outside

249
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:47,080
already fun gratulations you were able

250
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,930
to repeat your accidental success this

251
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:51,490
is verbatim what my college girlfriend

252
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:53,110
said to me after our second time having

253
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:53,470
sex

254
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:58,090
gusto makes Chinese bored GI I haven't

255
00:07:58,090 --> 00:07:59,350
seen marketing this blatantly racist

256
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:01,990
since H&amp;M s last campaign also I never

257
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,580
understood this just because he became

258
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,920
head chef at this restaurant and even if

259
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,020
he owns the restaurant how did gusto

260
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,910
dying transfer the gusto lightness

261
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:11,560
rights to this offer there are only two

262
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:17,130
way to get first pick Oh Giselle

263
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,300
accidentally witness loosens we deal

264
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,120
tell then chef linguini has prepared

265
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,340
something special and falls endless I'm

266
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:27,370
saying definitely off menu I mean I know

267
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:28,630
Skinner's trying to get linguine in

268
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,130
trouble but he's throwing the entire

269
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:31,510
restaurant under the bus to do it and

270
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,010
why would he want him out anyway his

271
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:34,300
lawyer just told him it's better to keep

272
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:37,080
an eye on him while he's on the staff

273
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,430
okay I've held it in as long as I can

274
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:41,169
the wait Brad Bird greets Linguini's

275
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:42,849
physical comedy is perfection and it's

276
00:08:42,849 --> 00:08:44,720
worth two sins off dammit

277
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,920
look I'm sure this is a great dish but

278
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,840
the entire restaurants gonna order the

279
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,850
same thing just based on looks it looks

280
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:52,590
like a goddamn pancreas covered in a

281
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:54,240
brown sauce it's kind of amazing rummy

282
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,160
shadow hasn't betrayed him before now it

283
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:02,310
is the City of Lights what I can't

284
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,779
believe is that Remmy is anywhere near

285
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:05,610
the colony considering the sewer split

286
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:07,529
up just after I left the countryside so

287
00:09:07,529 --> 00:09:09,300
there would be no way they'd both end up

288
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,860
in Paris especially anywhere near each

289
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:11,100
other

290
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,520
Remmy he's just now stealing what about

291
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,990
all that linguini gave him for dinner

292
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:18,000
you ever had the fat fried snow did you

293
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,220
work in the lab right no I was linguini

294
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,810
this cool if I'm keeping his secret he's

295
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:23,610
a wreck in the best of circumstances and

296
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:24,990
if he's drunk he would totally spill the

297
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:27,560
beans hey why did they call it that blot

298
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,060
ratatouille roll rodents

299
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:35,040
I am deeply and truly offended by these

300
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,770
musical instruments come with me I got

301
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:39,480
something I want you to see you better

302
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,920
come take a look at this cliche what

303
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,330
kind of shop would advertise their rat

304
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,400
traps with actual dead and rats hanging

305
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,480
in the window is this an effective

306
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,490
strategy like the customers walk by and

307
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:48,750
say well I was just gonna let those

308
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,490
fellows live but I guess if those traps

309
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,320
are that good I've gotta bite one also

310
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,940
is this really an entire store that

311
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:57,810
dedicated to killing rats this works

312
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:01,230
even while he's sleeping even in a movie

313
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:02,820
about an English understanding Michelin

314
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,680
star worthy rat chef in Paris this

315
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,420
linguine doesn't wake up crap is asking

316
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,230
too much of my suspension of disbelief

317
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:13,710
you're hard to talk to you you don't

318
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:15,030
have to talk at all if you're that

319
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,260
committed to telling Colette the truth

320
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,240
just take off your fucking hat awesome

321
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,040
glad to see this badass female chef

322
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,600
eventually fall for a forced kiss

323
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,980
seriously maybe you could have left this

324
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,660
love story out with no difference to the

325
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,190
overall movie I realize you have a

326
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:27,720
little coffin imagery going on and

327
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,280
that's fun but who would build a room

328
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,690
like this there's nothing on any of

329
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:32,310
these side walls but sound reducing

330
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,930
panels there's no functional reason for

331
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:35,670
the size or shape of this office which

332
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,530
suggests the character just left coffins

333
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:39,060
and wanted a coffin office and that

334
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,410
takes the fun out of the imagery much

335
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:41,550
like the way I take the fun out of

336
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,170
movies rat with hair and linguini with

337
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:44,790
willpower fight over the use of his arm

338
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,620
I originally wrote that as a description

339
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,940
of the footage somewhere editors would

340
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,230
know what I wanted here but then I

341
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,490
realized it perfectly summed up why this

342
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:52,110
is stupid and annoying I mean does

343
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,520
linguini not realize that his hat fell

344
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,260
off does he not care I know he's in love

345
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,270
and but he also knows that Remi is the

346
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,080
sole reason for

347
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,900
success hey Rebbe are you doing the

348
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,160
entire movie has been telling us that

349
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,480
the rat clan doesn't give a shit about

350
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,250
what they eat and that Remi was the only

351
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,870
outlier so why would there be a big

352
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,370
demand from the other rats about trying

353
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:14,940
ramiz food microwave burritos or to a

354
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,250
second chicken you know a 15% of this

355
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,720
movie is Remi talking to figments of his

356
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,410
imagination

357
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:21,630
why would when Queeny be filed with your

358
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:24,450
will this used to be my office classic

359
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:25,500
not answering the question

360
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,030
you know when you get down to it right -

361
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,770
doing is just an expanded episode of

362
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:30,210
those are you the dad episodes on

363
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:31,650
mooring it takes this long for a

364
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,060
motorized scooter to catch up with a

365
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,100
goddamn rat but why not just stay on the

366
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,480
roof there's no way for Skinner to get

367
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,370
up there and this is a boat it's really

368
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:39,600
nowhere to go I know this is an

369
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,040
interesting story but it's the ownership

370
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,960
of a local restaurant really dominating

371
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,830
front-page news

372
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:45,150
how about promoting the dock worker

373
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,980
strike that seems important why the hell

374
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,540
wouldn't Remi just ask linguine for the

375
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,370
food for his family he's the new owner

376
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:52,110
now right they could supply the whole

377
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:54,060
clan for very little overhead I find her

378
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,800
being a terrible floppy awkward skater

379
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,350
and linguine aka pratfall Jones being

380
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,090
smooth as butter on skates to be one of

381
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:01,650
this movie's biggest and most insulting

382
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:04,380
reaches some part of me just knew the

383
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,720
gusto part Remi will now grab a tuft of

384
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,430
hair on the left side of Linguini's body

385
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:10,170
but it will cause Linguini's right arm

386
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:11,760
to make a movement this is probably done

387
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,050
because the right hand happens to be on

388
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:14,460
the left side of his body right now and

389
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,900
it makes more visual sense to the viewer

390
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,400
this way but it's definitely wrong as

391
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,840
far as how the movie has shown this dork

392
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,390
I will return tomorrow night with high

393
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:23,670
expectations why do you give linguini

394
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:25,140
the heads up isn't the whole thing with

395
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,760
food critics that they sneak up on you I

396
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,020
thought they even wore disguises and

397
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:31,470
you're stealing food how could you I

398
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:33,930
thought you were my friend geez how many

399
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:35,370
times we have to see the characters

400
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:36,900
fight over a contrived reason before the

401
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,790
movies climax cliche Solan queen he's

402
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:40,200
having nightmares about egos visit

403
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,060
because you know he and the rat are on

404
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,650
the outs and somehow despite having

405
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:45,330
physically done all the acts of cooking

406
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:47,130
and watching it all with his eyeballs he

407
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:48,570
apparently never picked up any actual

408
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:49,260
know-how

409
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:52,410
tell him to hit me with his best shot

410
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:54,270
never a good look for a critic to set

411
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,920
his opinion prior to experience and the

412
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,300
thing he's here to critique this would

413
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,620
be like Leonard Maltin strolling into a

414
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:59,910
screening of Ant Man and the wasp

415
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,710
barking out oh let's get this over with

416
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:04,800
I would have whatever he is having um

417
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,870
this disguise and fake voice would not

418
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,790
fool a single person that works here at

419
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:10,230
the restaurant where this guy was the

420
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:11,939
boss for a long time

421
00:13:11,939 --> 00:13:13,349
how does this get solved if the car

422
00:13:13,349 --> 00:13:14,970
isn't conveniently parked under several

423
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:17,459
freestanding gargoyles I realize France

424
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:18,959
has a lot of gargoyles compared to

425
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,819
America at least but goddamn are they

426
00:13:20,819 --> 00:13:22,049
everywhere these are the most convenient

427
00:13:22,049 --> 00:13:23,999
gargoyles ever and Disney made a movie

428
00:13:23,999 --> 00:13:25,559
with gargoyles that were sentient I

429
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:27,029
seriously think Betty Crocker has a

430
00:13:27,029 --> 00:13:28,409
solid copyright infringement case

431
00:13:28,409 --> 00:13:29,789
against the publishers of Gusteau's

432
00:13:29,789 --> 00:13:31,319
cookbook they use blue instead of red

433
00:13:31,319 --> 00:13:32,999
and added some fleur-de-lis but in terms

434
00:13:32,999 --> 00:13:34,319
of design elements it's an open-and-shut

435
00:13:34,319 --> 00:13:34,739
case

436
00:13:34,739 --> 00:13:37,229
holy the students of raw as deal in this

437
00:13:37,229 --> 00:13:38,970
movie getting punished just for doing

438
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:40,349
his job he's treated worse than David

439
00:13:40,349 --> 00:13:42,089
Paymer in Ocean's thirteen maybe the

440
00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:43,259
rats will break a slot machine or

441
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:44,579
something as compensation at the end of

442
00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:44,909
the movie

443
00:13:44,909 --> 00:13:46,919
cute visual but again the problem with

444
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:48,509
rats in the kitchen isn't literal dirt

445
00:13:48,509 --> 00:13:54,229
its disease in bacteria but whatever

446
00:13:54,229 --> 00:13:56,759
this moment is the best of Pixar

447
00:13:56,759 --> 00:13:58,559
encapsulated pure joy for the character

448
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:00,059
translates as pure joy for the viewer

449
00:14:00,059 --> 00:14:02,039
see illumination you don't have to rely

450
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:04,319
on fart jokes in a kid's movie once and

451
00:14:04,319 --> 00:14:06,689
off the following day his review appears

452
00:14:06,689 --> 00:14:08,429
Jesus he was there until after closing

453
00:14:08,429 --> 00:14:10,289
no way a dude that old works on a

454
00:14:10,289 --> 00:14:12,869
deadline that early in anyways the work

455
00:14:12,869 --> 00:14:15,479
of a critic is easy damn this is our

456
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:17,819
third narrator in this movie we thrive

457
00:14:17,819 --> 00:14:20,909
on negative criticism which is found to

458
00:14:20,909 --> 00:14:23,099
write and read dude just unknowingly

459
00:14:23,099 --> 00:14:25,259
wrote our mission statement well we had

460
00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:26,699
to let Skinner in the health inspector

461
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,739
loose and somehow never encountered any

462
00:14:28,739 --> 00:14:30,629
legal or ethical issues for abusing and

463
00:14:30,629 --> 00:14:32,159
imprisoning them haha what a ripping

464
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:34,199
good yarn that abduction story is ha ha

465

ha which one would you like surprised me

466
00:14:37,289 --> 00:14:39,329
and rats were never considered vermin

467
00:14:39,329 --> 00:14:41,009
again and swarmed into kitchens around

468
00:14:41,009 --> 00:14:43,279
the world the end

469
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:52,189

what I say is true it rubs the lotion on

472
00:14:56,149 --> 00:14:59,139
its skin or else it gets the hose again

473
00:14:59,139 --> 00:15:04,569
