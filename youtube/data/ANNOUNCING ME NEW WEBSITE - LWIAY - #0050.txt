00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:08,800
LLaASSTTT wEek I asked you guys to make a green screen competition. I recorded myself. Look at this =(...

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:15,699
How can you not be creative with this?-_- (10/10) Oh boy I can't wait to see all the submissions. Oh look, there are none!

3
00:00:15,699 --> 00:00:17,350
You're all a bunch of crybabies (no u)

4
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:24,860
I think I have the fan base on YouTube consisting more and more and mostly of just a bunch of whiny sons of guns (getting that ad rev eh)

5
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:31,940
I can't swear and it pisses me off whatever. You know what I dOn't cArE. Let's just lEt's just jump into it

6
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:41,380
*gibberish stuff* - (YOU MEAN ARTT)

7
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:46,620
In Finland, we have a button to thank the bus driver when leaving. (0o0)

8
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,800
No, that can't be real. No honestly, it's not real, right?

9
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:56,379
''I am not prepared to wield such power.'' What happens if you don't press it? I have so many questions

10
00:00:56,379 --> 00:01:01,829
Are they located all across the bus or is it in a spot where the bus driver will see it?

11
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:05,700
How does it signal the bus driver?? Does it play a little thank-you song? [maybe, i think not]

12
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,880

00:10:54,910 --> 00:11:00,000
Everyone a round of applause for hirosensei2 - that's it for this week's LIWAYYY *More claps*

140
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,550
Youtube's favorite show everybody if you enjoyed this video smash like and subscribe if you haven't already

141
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:09,070
Submit a meme give it a go. Give it a try

142
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:13,290
It doesn't seem to matter what I tell you guys to do you'll just do whatever you want

143
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:20,640
Anyway, so just do what you do. Um, this is not a big deal or whatever. I'm having some problem with my videos

144
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,950
I don't know if it's a technical issue or whatever

145
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:28,320
I'm trying to sort it out with YouTube, but it seems like they're not publishing properly

146
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:34,090
I know it's such an old meme but they're not publishing properly to sub boxes. I

147
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:39,180
subscribe to my own channel, so I know it's not working properly because I'm not getting notified myself

148
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:44,530
And I don't know it's just a bunch of annoying stuff that you have to deal with behind the scenes

149
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:51,210
that can be really stressful and annoying but I notice a lot of really nice supportive comments in the last two videos and it really

150
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:56,080
Cheered me up when I was really annoyed. So I just want to say I appreciate you guys &lt;3

151
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,360
always being so

152
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,070
Supportive. I know it's like a meme or whatever that I'm so annoyed all the time

153
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:07,270
but I see you guys and I appreciate you and I wanted you to know that so thank you very much and (we love you too)

154
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:10,000
I'll see you tomorrow. Goodbye  *NOOO WHERES THE OUTRO* *cries in anime*
