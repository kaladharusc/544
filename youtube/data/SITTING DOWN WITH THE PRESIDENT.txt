26
00:01:58,270 --> 00:01:59,709
interesting part of the entire hotel

like there are any real rigid traffic

00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,830
laws here it's more of a every man for

74
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:40,230
themselves kind of mentality which I I

aren't traffic laws or just that people

88
