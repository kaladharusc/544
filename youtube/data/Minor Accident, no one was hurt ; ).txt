3
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:30,350
is that Candice that's my wife

4
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:33,890
that's not my wife that's Candace

5
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:35,720
sat me down like one would sit down a

6
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,610
small child and she schooled me on

7
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:40,430
wearing a helmet while I ride my boosted

8
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:42,050
board she's completely right so from now

9
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:43,760
on I'm going to make a much much much

10
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,530
bigger effort to wear this helmet wanna

11
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:47,300
ride my boosted board but about this

12
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,980
helmet I think I showed you before but I

13
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,510
saw a light from the front of the helmet

14
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:51,950
that looked like an emergency vehicle

15
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:53,510
that way people know to get the hell out

16
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:55,760
of my way I also installed in flashing

17
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,230
light in the back of the helmet so cars

18
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:59,210
coming up from behind know that it's me

19
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:01,700
but I just yesterday installed this here

20
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,980
emergency whistles via velcro with a

21
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,560
rope on the side of the helmet so now

22
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,030
when I ride I just keep this little

23
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:10,369
bastard right here I mouth like this and

24
00:01:10,369 --> 00:01:11,750

35
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,619

36
00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:37,549

37
00:01:37,549 --> 00:01:39,830

00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,420
he was like can you send them to me

43
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:49,100

44
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,110
threw them in my backpack so I wouldn't

52
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,870
talked about all these awesome pictures

53
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,610
and paintings that people make of me and

54
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:27,660
how I don't know what the hell to do

55
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:28,830
with them so I can't blow up my own

56
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:30,630
house and pictures of myself so super

57
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,520
