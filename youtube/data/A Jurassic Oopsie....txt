00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:05,290
Hello everybody. My name is Markiplier and welcome to jurassic world evolution

2
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:10,300
We're gonna play this and we're gonna get some dinos and they're probably gonna kill everybody on the island  [hair quiff]

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:17,560
And then Jeff Go- Jeff Goldblum is gonna talk. IAN: My name is Dr. Ian Malcolm. You may have heard of me. MARK: Uh-huh

4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:22,560
I: Well correction, you should have heard of me. Especially now that you're here. M: Ego, much?

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,820
I: So, before you are the islands that you need to manage.

6
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,320
M: Mmm. I: If you can.

7
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,449
I: The five deaths

8
00:00:31,449 --> 00:00:33,250
I: Jeez, if only-

9
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:38,200
I: If only there had been five. M: What kind of name for island is five deaths?

10
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,820
C: I'm Cabot Finch. M: Hi.

11
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:44,240
C: Public relations and crisis management, and I'm here to help you.

12
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,700
C: You'll start by building a Hammond creation lab.

13
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,000
M: We're good. Okay. What's a Hammond creation lab?

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,380
C: We've already started on an enclosure for you.

15
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:59,640
M: Uh huh. C: You should just attach it to the side, but watch out for dinosaurs! Hah! Just kidding...

16
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,280
M: *nervous laughter*

17
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:08,700
M: My whole family was murdered by dinosaurs! Ooh, something tells me I probably shouldn't blast it right in the middle of the fence there

18
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:16,580
But you know what? I like living on the edge. Let's do (it) right... there

19
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:18,760
C: Let's focus on what you're here to do. M: Uh huh.

20
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:23,420
C: Which is create dinosaur facilities on the islands we call the five deaths.

21
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,120
*weird Mark noise* lol im dyingXD

22
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:30,260
C: Actually, Las Cinco Muertes, because Spanish is the lingo of choice around here.

23
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:34,040
M: Of course it is. Alright.

24
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:34,540
M: Wow

25
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:39,840
C: You'll need to connect it to the pre-existing network of paths and the power grid

26
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,900
M: Okay, oh

27
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,320
M: Okay, all right, I di-I did it!

28
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,560
C: Now comes the real test: incubating a dinosaur. M: Oh boy!

29
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,980
C: You'll start with a struthiomimus. M: I know what that is. (suuuuuure)

30
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:58,200
C: Go to the creation lab and pick a hatchery Bay. M: uh huh. C: There's enough genome data for your first viable dinosaur.

31
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,200
M: Do I have to sit on it myself? Oh boy, I like him.

32
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,800
M: Oh, yeah, that's a good struthiomimus.

33
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:14,420
I'm gonna call you Screwthee or Mimo. I'm gonna call you Mimu. They're gonna be Mimu. All right, modified genome?

34
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:21,150
Can I do that? Can I do that? Can I just start picking random pieces in and out of this? Attack? Why?

35
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:27,049
Why do you? Uhuh! Why do we need attack and defense stats? That's what I'm kind of curious about. All right, whatever uhh..

36
00:02:27,049 --> 00:02:29,580
You know, it's probably fine.

37
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,830
Applied, ooh.

38
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:39,299
Apply gene. Okay. Viability is low. I like low via- null gene?

39
00:02:39,299 --> 00:02:46,280
Let's put bat DNA in here that's probably pretty good. Lifespan goes up. That's nice. I always like a long life.

40
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:54,340
Yeah, okay, let's do that. Yeah, let's um, let's do that. Yeah, I like that. A nice whatever the-wait what is-

41
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,240
Ohhh. *excited gasp*

42
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,720
Oooooooo

43
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:06,000
Oh, That's what that is. Okay, apply and then I didn't apply the bat, let's apply the bat. Okay, that's probably good.

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,580
Just mix and match. It's like a potluck dinner, but with genes- okay, incubate. Alright, I got warm but-

45
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:17,980
I: The machinations of the ambitious, undoing extinction. Playing with nature's laws.

46
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,000
What can possibly go wrong?

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:29,540
C: Come on doctor. You know, we've learned so much and invested even more in our Jurassic operation since the last time!

48
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,760
I: Yes, Mr. Finch.

49
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:36,260
I: Yes, the- the last time there's always the last time and a next

50
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:41,300
M: Okay, you're being real pessimistic about that, Jeff Goldblum.

51
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:45,800
Why are you doing that? Okay ready for release? Oh. Go! Be free!

52
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,280
Go!!!

53
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,070
Have fun! Woo!!

54
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:50,510
Mimu!

55
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:56,540
M: Mimu! Wow...*inaudible* I: It begins. The most precious moment. A result of

56
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:59,870
I: incalculable actions and reactions

57
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,790
I: trials and errors

58
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:05,690
I: Genetic mutations- M: Uh huh? I: Unknowable combinations

59
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:10,100
I: Chaos, all leading to a living, breathing,

60
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:16,700
thinking being. M: Wow. I: An entity distinct and unique and now we,

61
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,180
I: you, just...

62
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,800
I: manufacture them.

63
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,320
I: So, well done. I guess.

64
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,880
M: Thank you. I'm proud of what I've done. Jesus, Jeff Goldblum (is) so mad.

65
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:35,540
Why is he so mad? Just cuz a few thousand people died. The Dinos. Is that really- is that really that bad?

66
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:41,889
Probably. All right. Anyway, okay Mimu, let me get a good look at you. Oh, you're so cute

67
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:46,440
Okay, where- what? Where are you going? All right Mimu, you're doing great

68
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:55,320
I'd like Jeff Goldblum, like pessimistically nagging me for every little mistake that I do. What kind of stats have you got? great stats.

69
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,340
Drinking so nicely

70
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:02,169
Okay. Alright. Good-goodbye. I guess. Did I do good?

71
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:04,560
Did-did I- did I do good? What is this?

72
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,900
M: Are you just leaving me on my own now? C: The hammer foundation has three main areas of interest:

73
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,540
C: security,

74
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,389
C: entertainment, and *confused Mark*

75
00:05:13,389 --> 00:05:18,849
C: science. M: Why did you say it like that? I: l already nudge the heads of each division to reach out to you personally

76
00:05:18,849 --> 00:05:23,380
I: They'll offer opportunities and incentives for you to be part of their team

77
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,449
I: Choose one of their contracts.

78
00:05:25,449 --> 00:05:30,130
I: It'll help you develop your facility. M: Why did you say security like *uptight* security?

79
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:34,319
Hmm. Something tells me security is probably the most important, but I-

80
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:39,720
I, as a youtuber, I am all about that entertainment. Oh, hell yeah.

81
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,120
IS: Hey, I'm Isaac. M: Hey. IS: I've been hearing good things about you. M: *laughs* IS: I'm in charge of

82
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:51,220
IS: the entertainment division here. What good is the world's greatest show if no one sees it? Don't answer. That's rhetorical and

83
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,440
IS: painfully obvious.

84
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,600
IS: What I'm saying is that we need people in our parks.

85
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:02,770
IS: Fill up our facilities with warm bodies. Numbers bring revenue, excitement, and opportunities.

86
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:06,279
M: Warm juicy bodies. Mmm

87
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:09,250
filled to the brim with meat

88
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,349
those warm

89
00:06:11,349 --> 00:06:12,729
delicious

90
00:06:12,729 --> 00:06:15,669
Delicious bodies. Oh

91
00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:21,310
M: Oh, we're gonna fill this park-huh? C: Contracts can be requested on the division heads inside the control room.

92
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:28,539
C: Complete these to increase your reputation and gain additional revenue to keep expanding your park. M: Ah,

93
00:06:28,539 --> 00:06:32,969
Okay. All right, then. I'll do exactly that. I'll do exactly what you're saying

94
00:06:32,969 --> 00:06:38,980
Actually, I didn't hear a word what you're saying. It all went straight over my head. I was just thinking about those

95
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,520
juicy

96
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,520
delicious

97
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,260
bodies

98
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:47,160
Expedition Center, let's try...

99
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,820
Over here

100
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:54,339
M:Yeah. C: So, one more thing. Your reputation. Your &quot;rep&quot; quote unquote

101
00:06:54,339 --> 00:06:56,229
C: Keep an eye on it, okay?

102
00:06:56,229 --> 00:07:03,489
C: If you have a solid reputation with a division, you're more likely to benefit from them. Financially, I mean.

103
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:07,300
C: But, like life, it's a balancing act

104
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:14,039
C: Each division is vying for your attention. And if they don't get it, they tend to take it personally. M: Wow, okay

105
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:19,769
All right. This is a business. I don't take anything personally in the business. It's all about the finances and the numbers

106
00:07:19,769 --> 00:07:25,440
That's all we got to worry about. If we don't have the finances and the numbers, nothing's gonna work out for any of us.

107
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,960
C: The entertainment division is taking notice of your success. M: Oh.

108
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:38,980
C: As your reputation increases with them, so too does the opportunity to tackle more challenging missions. M: Let's do this. How??

109
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:44,100
How do I do oh

110
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,179
IS: Hey, It's Isaac. M: Hey!

111
00:07:46,179 --> 00:07:50,649
IS: I got some cool stuff you need to be a part of, so I'm putting it out there.

112
00:07:50,649 --> 00:07:54,360
IS: Come on and help the winning team. Mine. M: Oh my god.

113
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:59,229
I- I will. I absolutely will. I want to be part of a winn- I'm a winner!

114
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:06,069
I've always told myself. I'm a winner. My mom always always have told me that I, I am a straight-up winner

115
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:11,740
All right. Okay. There we go. I'm staring at like how do I do this? Start. I'm ready.

116
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:18,900
M: Oh, come on now, you know you wanna give me that money. That's where people come in. IS: All right, look. I am all about the show, M: Me, too.

117
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:23,440
IS: and with these dinosaurs, we have one unlike any other on the planet! M: Wow..

118
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:29,800
IS: Theme parks rely on drawing people in, and what is more attractive than new dinosaurs? Well, me

119
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,190
IS: Of course *Isaac chuckles* (i dont like him)

120
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:35,810
IS: Yeah, no, what I'm saying is let's get some fresh dinos in the hopper.

121
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:42,649
M: Dinos in the hopper, like a paintball gun, we're gonna shoot dinos at people? Because that sounds

122
00:08:42,649 --> 00:08:46,480
fucking awesome. I would love to do that. Can we get a giant Dino gun?

123
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:53,289
That just like really- their mouths open to scoop up as many warm bodies as possible. Oh, yeah

124
00:08:53,289 --> 00:09:00,400
M: I think we're all- C: The fossil center lets you extract DNA from fossils and amber in order to create new

125
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:06,440
C: dinosaur genomes. M: Wow. C: Exciting! M: Yeah, that actually is exciting.

126
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:12,610
Viewable genomes allow you to create dinosaurs at the hand creation lab expedition. Sometimes bring back extra fine. Zeca meat sold for cash

127
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:19,250
I like cash. I like cash, um view fossils

128
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:28,399
Got Struthio. Should we actually make the Struthio better? Oooh.

129
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:34,250
I think that's what we need, too. Let's extract that bad boy. Oh, yeah.

130
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:40,480
What about this one? Probably? Yeah, I mean shouldn't we extract all these? I mean selling them would be great

131
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,540
But I'm gonna entertain people, I want to get all of these. I want to get them in a big box

132
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,570
We're gonna create like an MMA cage

133
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:50,240
We're gonna put all the dinos in there and they're just gonna Duke it out as hard as they can

134
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,760
expedition map

135
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:03,280
M: What? C: An expedition Center will allow you to send dig teams around the world in search of dino fossils. M: I-I've already got it.

136
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:08,420
C: DNA can be extracted from these fossils which our scientists can then turn into living breathing

137
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:12,950
C: Dinosaurs and that's our true lifeblood

138
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:18,940
M: Okay, thank you. I was already in the middle of that. I was doing just fine. We're gonna get the carnivorous

139
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:25,840
C: Good! Your first expedition team is out. M: Thank you. C: They'll bring back what they find to the fossil center for extraction

140
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:30,000
M: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for noticing how hard I work. (mark are you kidding)(scroll through the comments once in a while)

141
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,340
M: So we've almost got the genome that we need- C: Your job is simple, really.

142
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:41,500
C: Create dinosaurs which attract visitors to your facilities brings in capital, money, huh, which means you can do more research

143
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:47,760
M: Money, huh!! C: to create better facilities and create more dinosours and there you go!

144
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:55,300
C: Circle of life, development and resources, nature and commerce. See, simple.

145
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,720
M: MONEY, HUUUUUU

146
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:06,610
M: You gotta get your moNEY, get the caPTIAL so you can make the money, wink-wink, warm bodies

147
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:12,660
HHH?! I get it. I understand we're on the same page. Okay, so I didn't get enough I got to get one more

148
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:20,100
But when my expedition comes back, then I'm gonna be able to do what we need to do. But let's see what we got here

149
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:28,780
C: The research center lets you improve your park in various, exciting ways. New buildings, upgrades, and more await.

150
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:34,570
M: Okay, that's all you're gonna say about it? Okay, all right, whatever. Like I give a shit about upgrades, all right

151
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,270
How does this help me entertaining?

152
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:41,490
Give me an upgrade that allows a t-rex to try to juggle with its tiny arms, because that sounds hilarious.

153
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:43,529
I want to see a T-Rex trying its best like,

154
00:11:43,529 --> 00:11:50,280
&quot;I can't do it&quot; then it has to lean all the way down to pick it up when it drops some that sounds hilarious.

155
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,480
Intuitive learning

156
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:59,500
That'll help it juggle. Helliya intuitive learning that seems obvious. Did they come back yet? They got to be close, right?

157
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,060
Yes, maybe

158
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:06,640
Yes

159
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:11,350
Dude shut your hole

160
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:24,880
Wow, that's very high-quality. Oh, we're gonna extract that DNA we're gonna get ourselves a t-rex

161
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:29,020
Let's see, we need small power station, okay

162
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,930
I'm Owen great Ohioans my friends

163
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:40,180
I've seen things I'd rather not talk about but it hasn't dampened my commitment to the dinosaurs the Raptors more generally and me and blue

164
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:46,540
Specifically we have a special relationship. Like what I have is clear less complicated

165
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:49,920
Anyway, nice to meet you

166
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:58,380
Who the fuck are you power is something we simply cannot ignore when it comes to our operations now power we

167
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,600
We we don't have any power

168
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,430
Who that?

169
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:07,680
Who the fuck was that? Who was that? That wasn't Chris?

170
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:13,560
Really? Well, they got Jeff Goldblum two voices, but they didn't get Chris

171
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:20,670
Horrible that felt wrong I feel dirky no, no no, so I've already heard that

172
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:22,200
putting a

173
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:30,240
Putting a t-rex in the same enclosure as my other dinosaur is a bad idea, right? Okay. All right

174
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,220
However, I know that's a bad idea

175
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:40,080
Mm-hmm. Okay, we don't have any gene. They're treating these creatures like grist for the mill or cropping them up as curiosities. I

176
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:43,770
Don't know what grist is but you know

177
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:48,660
That's all right. Robust digestion really gonna need a robust

178
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,670
statistic when you uh

179
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:55,700
Meet up with me Moo there a all right. This seems pretty good. I don't think we have any more that we could do

180
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:59,250
So we've applied that. All right now, let's

181
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:13,890
incubate this bad boy right up

182
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:18,350
My Park that's why I need to build observation decks, that's what I need

183
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:23,190
All right. I need to send people on an expedition. All right. Oh, yeah

184
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:30,300
We're gonna need more Sarah to Saurus DNA. Hmm for those warm

185
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,160
bodies

186
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:40,650
And you'll learn once he's learning to juggle. Then he'll have an ambition for us. He'll get a taste for learning

187
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:44,010
No, he's not done yet. Ah

188
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:49,590
Well, I'm an impatient son of a bitch you need to hurry up with what you're doing okay genetic research but

189
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:57,030
Let's try medical treatment. What do we got hook worm parasite. Oh, no, they can get it. No

190
00:14:57,030 --> 00:15:03,030
Hmm, they can get sick. Well, I don't want my guy to get sick. I want him to be healthy

191
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:10,600
Percent healthy unstoppable even that's like my ideal for my dinosaurs. I want them to be completely

192
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,230
Irresponsibly healthy

193
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:20,140
Boy oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy

194
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:24,520
There you go. Why are they looking down? They should be looking up

195
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:35,020
Yeah. Yeah, no hookworms for you

196
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:44,650
Very scary, I like your horn

197
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:51,070
Do that by making sure their needs

198
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:54,220
More demands and less understanding. Oh

199
00:15:54,220 --> 00:16:01,120
Yeah, there we go. Oh, he's on to something Oh Nemo, maybe run

200
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,890
maybe run

201
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:10,860
Maybe No

202
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:25,600
Oh boy, maybe maybe 100 well now

203
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,760
We reach the inevitable

204
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,310
life baguettes death

205
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:34,630
But here's the question. You gotta ask yourself was this avoidable?

206
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:36,310
the answer

207
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:37,990
of course not

208
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:42,760
Death it's always coming. But could you have delayed it?

209
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,990
well

210
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:46,900
That's maybe another story. Ah

211
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:54,520
Could I have delayed it? Mmm? Probably not. The only thing I know is how to accelerate the process

212
00:16:54,520 --> 00:17:02,920
All right. Now I just need to send some humans in to go collect the corpse. Oh, it's gone. Alright, never mind then well

213
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:08,170
This guy, I don't know. It is named Jerry. Jerry is fed

214
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:19,180
Jerry has been fed. And you know, we're all happier for it. Like what come back Jerry Jerry

215
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,500
Yours

216
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,510
and mine

217
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:30,760
Welcome to the islands. So here's our basic conundrum. We want to keep our animals under control while simultaneously

218
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:37,210
Encouraging instinctive behaviors because these animals have potential as combatants

219
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:42,790
Everyone's fear object myself included is to have these animals running free and loose in the park

220
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:46,690
But we can't exploit them globally without taking some chances

221
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,250
Mm-hmm

222
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,270
I

223
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:50,950
like I like the

224
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:56,470
Combatant thing you were saying there. That sounds real cool. How do I make him fight?

225
00:17:56,470 --> 00:18:00,250
Because that that sounds real cool. All right

226
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,710
constructing power of fast food

227
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:08,850
I've already got one but we're too got one here the park this little enclosure this very fast food

228
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:13,270
It's running as fast as it can like for its life

229
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:17,880
But it's just not fast enough is what you're saying. Okay, so I got to get faster food

230
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:23,460
I want a nice restaurant overlooking the the death of the zone here

231
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:26,740
I think this is like this is this is gonna be

232
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:33,120
Gettin C shelter period why do we need that? Nothing's gonna go wrong gift shop fad all fast food

233
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:43,000
Oh, it's too big build it in

234
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,160
Some C an issue with uh anything that's heavy. Oh, here's a door right here, okay

235
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:53,200
Well, let's just let's just plop Ruth at yep. Oh, yeah that looks

236
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,330
I

237
00:18:55,330 --> 00:19:00,640
Don't see an issue. Well, I don't think unless you guys see an issue which I don't think any at all

238
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,660
Well, that's I already knew about

239
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:11,020
Dead dinosaurs should be removed with a transport team to prevent disease. Oh, well, I guess there's no corpse cuz it was eaten

240
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:16,180
So, oh well. All right. Let's get power

241
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:21,160
let's get power going from here to

242
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,780
Right there

243
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:29,050
That's looking good. Now now we're gonna have some power. Why is there no power. Oh, do I need a substitution?

244
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:35,350
Okay, instead of a wait. No, let's let's how do I how do I bowl Dario bulldoze that let's get rid of that

245
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:41,230
Let's put a substitution. That's not a substitution

246
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:47,380
Oh snap that bad boy right in there, they're really they really know what they're doing here. Alright, so we got to build a road

247
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:50,080
Let's see if we build a road from here Oh

248
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,370
Bill cost obstructed. Well, we're just gonna have to get it out of the way now, aren't we?

249
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:59,140
Okay, we don't need demolish gate one. Yeah

250
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:05,020
Yeah, there we go, okay, this is probably fine, alright we'll put this right Oh

251
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:11,850
A nice curve to it. That's what that's what we all really like now people can eat and see look

252
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:17,110
He's friendly he's coming all he's so curious easily watch this

253
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:19,840
Mmm, this looks fun

254
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,690

hmm

258
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:40,160
Dinosaur threat, he's threatened who's threatening my dinosaur. Oh, come on now. Oh, he's running. He's scared Oh,

259
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,640
Oh

260
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:48,090
No, come back Oh someone pushed him out of his hole. I can't believe this I can't oh

261
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:52,170
He's so scared. Somebody go up and give him a bag all huh

If you just try to understand them

264
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,910
Then

265
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:09,510
They're not so bad. We're not so different after all

266
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:10,650
look

267
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:15,030
Entertainment objective look at that

268
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:21,420
Are you going look see he's just he's hot he's looking for some shade

269
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:26,040
What a beautiful beautiful creature. Hey, look at that

270
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:31,020
Research item from research center. Oh, I am making money. I

271
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,690
Am making a profit. Oh

272
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:40,440
Hell yeah. Oh, yeah, I gotta go. I got a research something control room research

273
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:46,290
Building that one got it. People want to get clothes. I mean their clothes are gonna get real bloody

274
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:50,120
So, you know they want to they want to definitely have that. Where are you gone?

You little scamp. Come Dooley. Ho ho Lee hyung. Are you going for a jog? Yeah exercise is very important

276
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:02,490
See look at that. They're going to the fast-food restaurant. They're totally fine Oh,

277
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:08,460
What's wrong? What's wrong buddy? You lonely you do. You want a friend? Oh I can get you a friend

All right, he's already going friends already on the way see he's not causing nobody no trouble see that's the thing

282
00:22:42,499 --> 00:22:45,659
This guy's causing nobody. No trouble

283
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:52,769
He's full as the thing. So he's not, you know, he's not he's very comfortable. Look how comfortable he is. Look at that comfort

284
00:22:52,769 --> 00:22:54,809
That's so nice. Ah

285
00:22:54,809 --> 00:23:00,149
Let's see. We got more fossils. Yes, we do. Let's go research those. Um,

286
00:23:00,149 --> 00:23:07,799
Well, we already got them. I mean I might as well I'm gonna be making money hand over fist anyway. Ooh silver

287
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:11,999
Alright sure fine by me. Let's go send another expedition

288
00:23:11,999 --> 00:23:18,889
Anybody else? Let's see. Oh hang hang go Saurus. Alright, sure. I don't know what that means

289
00:23:18,889 --> 00:23:24,200
But let's go off to the hanging along until our friend is ready. Oh, it's gonna be a while

290
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:28,110
Okay, so we need to research something

291
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:30,779
Daily to do blue, dude

292
00:23:30,779 --> 00:23:38,580
Intensive repair. Okay, that's probably pretty good. I should probably get like them a forest camo so that they can't be seen

293
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:45,480
When they're like in the trees cuz I maybe he's good enough cuz I don't know where he is. I mean, he's probably fine but

294
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:50,610
Yeah, that's probably fine. Okay, so he's off doing his own thing. He's having fun over there. I

295
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:56,869
Will get Oh see no danger, no danger no more. I don't know where he went. But no, where is he?

296
00:23:56,869 --> 00:24:03,029
Oh, come on now Oh over there. Okay. Now he's having a good time. Okay. All right

297
00:24:03,029 --> 00:24:07,679
So we need to build

298
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,590
Clothes shop

299
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:14,280
Hell yeah, people are always gonna be wanting to buy clothes once they're uh,

300
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:19,860
you know after they piss their pants from the dinosaurs not that there's any actual danger, but you know people probably

301
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:24,169
Probably be a little surprised at least it's like a jump scare that eats you, you know

302
00:24:24,169 --> 00:24:27,809
really like the original jump scare was when a tiger would just

303
00:24:27,809 --> 00:24:33,350
Rawr from out of the out of the out of the forest like you you would be like, oh that was whoa

304
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:37,820
You got me and then he gets you you know about that was really the original jump scare

305
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:43,320
And I think people forget that hell. Yeah research. Did we get more fossils?

306
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:50,250
Nice, I don't know if your Wang is I don't know what that is, but I like it shewag

307
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:52,980
ciona debt, no dinosaur DNA

308
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,419
Okay

309
00:24:54,419 --> 00:24:59,280
Rhenium, whatever that is. All right, we're good. It's time for friend

310
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,400
release oh

311
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,530

You are gonna get along so well, I can't even imagine I can't even imagine it

314
00:25:14,299 --> 00:25:17,010
I'm out of money that's impossible

315
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:37,380
That's impossible. That's absolutely unpossible. If you think I'm out of money, you're just out of your mind, so don't even try that

316
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:43,500
Alone or in a group, you just don't want to run into them. Oh, he's curious. Don't fuck

317
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:48,900
Her what are you doing? No, come on, man. He's just oh

318
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:53,220

319
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:57,570
Bad bad Sarah Michael Sarah

320
00:25:57,570 --> 00:26:01,950
That's bad. That's real bad. You're bad

321
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:06,299
uh-oh alone or in a group

322
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:12,990
That's no crunching the guests, that's a bad that's bad

323
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:19,860
That's real bad. Are you gonna behave yourself? You're gonna be you take a drink you think about what you've done?

324
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:36,519
That's enough crunching for one day. Okay, and shockingly no one is stopping

325
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:43,570
Hmm no one seems to be upset about this

326
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:44,980
Jimmy

327
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:48,399
Well, this is whatever your name was JJ

328
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:49,960
now now

329
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:53,769
What have we talked about crunching the guests? Ah

330
00:26:53,769 --> 00:26:58,809
Can't believe man more paper

331
00:26:58,809 --> 00:27:04,649
I guess what I'm doing is working people want that real exciting experience people

332
00:27:04,649 --> 00:27:09,929
I just want to like really sink their teeth into this they want to like latch on none none

333
00:27:09,929 --> 00:27:16,000
They wanted to feel they want to feel they want to feel something real people will pay for those experiences. So

334
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,700
Yeah, it was pretty good. All right

335
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,880
operations ranger station

336
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:27,279
Resupply feeders. Okay, they need to resupply the feeders. Okay, that's probably important

337
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:35,590
Pretty good. How is that not connected by itself? You'd think that would be connected by itself. All right. There we go

338
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:39,760
This is our new director of operations hello

339
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:44,080
I'm dr. Dua. I run the science division of our operation

340
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:51,519
Okay, you're going to need to build your reputation in the science division not easy with me around but you'll manage

341
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:58,179
That means managing our dinosaur population and seeing that they are flourishing

342
00:27:58,179 --> 00:28:05,769
No, I'm okay. All right. No, I'm good. Thank you no need for that. I'm already well taken care of we've got

343
00:28:05,769 --> 00:28:13,570
So much cool stuff happening here, and we do not need anything from you. I am out of money

344
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:17,760
What did I need to build a viewing gallery where even is a viewing gallery you ink it

345
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:23,019
Ah, I can build it. I can still build it. Oh, they're gonna get such a good view. Oh

346
00:28:23,019 --> 00:28:24,610
man, oh

347
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:27,490
That's so good all view away

348
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:33,830
We'll see see look Michael Cera is still in here. Can I name them? Can I do that? Alright, you're Michael

349
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:36,070
My looks like you've run out of power Sarah

350
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:38,929
I don't know if I spelled that right look more power stations or

351
00:28:38,929 --> 00:28:44,629
Increase your outlet Oh increase so I can just like overload this thing. Can I just like blast it up?

352
00:28:44,629 --> 00:28:49,009
Like really just slam it out there. Can I just like oh

353
00:28:49,009 --> 00:28:54,159
Can I just like tell him to go harder? Well, I can't build one. So what do you expect me to do?

354
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:58,610
How about a power upgrade? I don't know. I don't have enough money

355
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:05,919
Huh? Where's my missions? Which where's where's my missions? I thought I was I had a million dollar contract

356
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:07,179
I'm making super money

357
00:29:07,179 --> 00:29:11,590
But what the hell I mean these guys they expect so much out of me, but I can only do so much

358
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:16,100
Okay, we're gonna get an observation deck

359
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:20,090
Is what we aim to give our guests make them appreciate the little things

360
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:24,499
Yeah, and the big things with the teeth and glassy eyes that could swallow them whole

361
00:29:24,499 --> 00:29:32,110
Yeah, appreciate those things preach them preach those things. We're gonna preach him hard. Oh, they are preaching

362
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:35,840
Oh, you better believe that here in this place

363
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:40,570
We preach everything that we got one thing has no power, but that's okay. It's only the ranger station

364
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:47,470
We didn't need that anyway. All right, so we need

365
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:51,870
Construct live bait feeder. Whoo. I like live bait. How do I how do I do that?

366
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:54,240
Then the guests is it in the guest section

367
00:29:54,240 --> 00:30:02,680
I'm guessing it just like picks a guest up by crane and just drops them right in is that what it is live bait? Oh

368
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:07,570
Just too expensive. Why is everything in this game? So expensive?

369
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:14,980
Man maybe there's another dinosaur park that wants to buy Michael Cera good Dynes already has often just he's like wow

370
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,490
combat infamy Oh

371
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:23,200
Can I actually make fighting bits? Can I actually honestly make fighting pits for my dinosaurs? Oh

372
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:29,200
Yes. Oh, yes, so I'm making a profit. I guess I just got to wait till I get a hundred

373
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,980
thousand

374
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:43,660
There we go contract, oh request a new contract give me a new contract entertain

375
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:47,470
Okay, can I have a hundred thousand what is the contract

376
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:50,830
build connect and power a hotel Oh

377
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:54,490
Smart. Oh no. No Michael, Michael

378
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:56,050
Michael

379
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:57,520
Michael

380
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:03,100
What the hell we're gonna get a hotel eventually once we get this live bait feeder. We are going to be so

381
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,680
So good. We still making money

382
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,600
yeah a

383
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,330
Guest injury lawsuits. Oh, that's not so bad

384
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:16,570
Well, we can we can manage with that. Oh, no. I know we can't manage with that

385
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:21,190
Hmm

386
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:25,330
Something seems something about my business model doesn't seem right

387
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:32,740
Hmm. Maybe you guys a lot of look behind you you ever thought about turning around you ever thought about

388
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:36,270
I'm sorry. This is this is shouldn't Oh, your Park is bankrupt

389
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:41,580
You will need to raise castle with what you have sell unnecessary buildings fossils dinosaurs. Oh, I can sell a dinosaur

390
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,880
How do I do that?

391
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,460
How do I sell a dino?

392
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:47,500
How do I sell a dino?

393
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,390
Can I sell a dino?

394
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:54,540
You're you were Jeremy. You're Jeremy. How do I sell to Jeremy?

395
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:57,970
Oh No gerrae god damn it Jeremy

396
00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:00,510
All right, these guys they were they were behaving well

397
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:06,120
And and I I think like it's I think it's videogames violent video games are really influencing these dinosaurs

398
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:13,390
They're really causing them to come like out of control. They like you play one violent video game and the next thing you know

399
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:20,560
Eating up people crunching a left and right crunch crunch crunch can't do it. Yeah, I can't sell one eye

400
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:24,490
Is impossible to sell hmm well, oh

401
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:27,550
The ranger station. How do we sell that?

402
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:31,960
Wait, what if I just click the demolish button? Oh

403
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:37,810
There we go. Oh wait. We're still not enough dead. Hmm. All right. Well, the one thing we don't need is power

404
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:39,670
Well, maybe we do we need to power that

405
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:47,860
I've gotta bolt. Someone's gonna come up to to a micheal cera over here with a bulldozer and just be like

406
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:53,740
Taking you down no, don't worry. Oh, well the roads if I sell the roads we don't need roads

407
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,480
obviously

408
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,670
dah

409
00:32:56,670 --> 00:33:02,260
I should have realized I'm so smart. All right, we got this. No roads, no roads. It's more natural this way

410
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:05,770
Anyway, we're building trees too. So that's just like double extra plus

411
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:12,420
All right. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, nope. Nope, none of this none of this

412
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:18,690
Oh, yeah, Wow, let's get that money back. I know this none of this none of this no more clothes

413
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:25,990
We don't need clothes and we've got money. We've got money. All right, so we just need to power a hotel

414
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:33,040
Let's demolish this let's demolish this most most of this. Let's demolish this and let's build a hotel

415
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:40,350
That seems pretty good to me live bait feeder, right? This is the only exhibit that we really need right there

416
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:42,820
that's real nice and then

417
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:45,700
We're gonna build a hotel

418
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:51,190
Oh, there we go. Oh that's looking pretty

419
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:54,839
BAM

420
00:33:54,839 --> 00:34:04,619
Hahahaha million dollars. Yeah million dollars

421
00:34:04,619 --> 00:34:12,960
Maximum happiness and our guest numbers are up as a result. That's what makes the entertainment division the envy of the rest

422
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,159
Oh

423

So I can't exactly sell it so

512
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:53,290
Alright, oh my god, is there a possibility of making money

I don't think these guys know they're there so

519
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:23,599
Michael Sarah and Jeremy are doing real good. If only I could move the live bait feeder in there, but

526
00:42:45,859 --> 00:42:50,599
There's no loss scenario in this game. I can't believe that

527
00:42:50,599 --> 00:42:53,810

00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:19,490
That's a 40 million that's 3 million that's for 3 million and you know, who's about to be born. Whoo, yes

570
00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:23,210
It's a free million. No, wait, no

571
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:31,700
Yes, I am all about the show oh

572
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:36,980
There we go, we've got our dinos oh

573
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:43,460
We do we do strive by making sure their needs

574
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:47,690
Just with more demands and less understanding

575
00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:54,290
You are right you are right my friend those guests are so demanding Oh Dody Beto

576
00:46:54,290 --> 00:46:59,980
Whatever. No one wants to hear it loser. Anyway, yeah, okay. Alright, let's put this down

577
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:07,400
I guess people can be a little bit. Well fed. Everyone's got to be well-fed here the dinos everything we are Oh,

578
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:13,520
Well tonight wait, what about that contract that I just accepted? Wait, no, but my contract I just know I had a

579
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:17,030
But you but you said you'd I was gonna get a million

580
00:47:17,030 --> 00:47:25,910
You should you should but you said I was but that's not who you said. I was supposed to get the the the this deal

581
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:30,530
Did I get a million from that or any clothes shop and a viewing gallery? Alright, we need the viewing gallery

582
00:47:30,530 --> 00:47:33,369
That's what I originally that's what I originally wanted

583
00:47:33,369 --> 00:47:35,859
I want I want to put the the viewing gallery right here

584
00:47:35,859 --> 00:47:39,040
And then the live feeder is going to be like, alright, actually no

585
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:42,940
We'll have the viewing gallery over here. And then the live feeder will be right in the way

586
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:47,740
I want to see him like run for it. I'll be great. Alright, so we got that that's being built

587
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:53,210
We're gonna build a closed shop. And then these guests are gonna be safe and happy whatever

588
00:47:53,210 --> 00:48:04,460
That's raining sell umbrellas. I gotta sell umbrellas charge $20 for the non, Briella

589
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:06,400
The little things like this little goat

590
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:06,849
Okay

591
00:48:06,849 --> 00:48:10,780
we're gonna have a live bait feeder right on top of this hill it's gonna be like

592
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:17,329
It's gonna be like feeding hell or maybe like right here. Oh, we can't they we really want to see that goat. They're

593
00:48:17,329 --> 00:48:19,400
Right there. Oh, yeah, they are

594
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:26,589
That couldn't be better that couldn't be better. Oh, yeah there. Oh, they're so happy. Well, they're so happy. Oh, they're so happy

595
00:48:26,589 --> 00:48:32,890
I'm happy they're happy. We're all happy. We're so happy. Alright, go again

596
00:48:32,890 --> 00:48:36,369
Wow

597
00:48:36,369 --> 00:48:45,579
Million dollars a million a million

598
00:48:45,579 --> 00:48:52,839
Look at a bulb. I guess. We're so happy

599
00:48:52,839 --> 00:48:54,700
We're doing great Oh

600
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:58,119
Triceratops, that sounds like a friend of the

601
00:48:58,119 --> 00:49:02,559
Jeremy and Michael Cera, are you just waiting for a live bait feeder? Can I just

602
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:10,150
Do every few minutes discarding any leftovers must be restocked periodically by Ranger teams

603
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:19,150
Different dinosaurs require different diets make sure to place the correct type of feeder in an enclosure

604
00:49:19,150 --> 00:49:22,329
Haha, I mean you're made of red meat or what

605
00:49:22,329 --> 00:49:25,559
What does that mean - that live bait feeder, you know, it's gonna pop out

606
00:49:25,559 --> 00:49:27,180
Wait, did one pop out already

607
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:32,069
When did one pop out did you guys see that get eaten a bit you did a bit?

608
00:49:32,069 --> 00:49:38,400
You do Wow, look at the Dino is so scary. Oh, that's a nice detail with the way the Sun reflects off of that

609
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:43,390
Oh, that's such a nice detail actually play the game not like seven years old

610
00:49:43,390 --> 00:49:48,900
Well, just you wait because I'm only building up to the point where I can ruin absolutely everything

611
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:55,930
It's it's a it's a comin don't you worry? Let me see if I can get that hotel contract

612
00:49:55,930 --> 00:49:58,299
please

613
00:49:58,299 --> 00:49:59,650
Oh

614
00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:06,519
No, I'm not gonna do that, please. Oh shit. Alright, well, that's I tried and tried and it didn't work

615
00:50:06,519 --> 00:50:13,660
Hey see you sooner. That's not important. That's probably important you waiting. He's waiting. Isn't he? He's so smart

616
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:18,430
It's that bird DNA that I put inside of him Oh

617
00:50:18,430 --> 00:50:28,240
Alright we got silver cell that let's see more DNA and oh good DNA. Alright, we're gonna get that and then we need another expedition

618
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:31,470
Partially depleted does that mean that we can go again and it's okay

619
00:50:31,470 --> 00:50:31,930
I

620
00:50:31,930 --> 00:50:37,019
Mean if it's partially depleted that means it can still go but I don't know if it's gonna be like a reduced deficiency or anything

621
00:50:37,019 --> 00:50:41,049
Like that. Are you still come on? There we go

622
00:50:41,049 --> 00:50:43,979
Alright enclosures one item available

623
00:50:43,979 --> 00:50:46,170
electrified lights deal

624
00:50:46,170 --> 00:50:51,049
Sounds pretty wait. What? Oh, I need more power. That's right. I do need more power. Okay

625
00:50:51,049 --> 00:50:54,180
Do I need to just build another small power station?

626
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:55,710
probably

627
00:50:55,710 --> 00:50:59,099
500

628
00:50:59,099 --> 00:51:07,829
500 days five hundo hundies. Are you kidding me and squat? Oh

629
00:51:07,829 --> 00:51:16,049
Wow, okay, once that's done we should be plenty of power and a plenty of moolah but a lot less

630
00:51:16,049 --> 00:51:23,220
Excitement, you know what? I mean? Because I'm really really really like I'm really pulling for some excitement here. We're not getting it because

631
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:26,940
Parkes is doing okay, but it's not doing like great

632
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:32,519
It could be better. It could always be better upgrade the first power station. Well, that sounds impossible

633
00:51:32,519 --> 00:51:37,950
I only have outage protection and I don't even know what the baseline outage protection could be

634
00:51:37,950 --> 00:51:45,630
What is the outage possibility for this? I don't even know but it's not expensive. So I'll get out of protection sure, whatever uh-uh

635
00:51:45,630 --> 00:51:49,739
Let's do the power upgrade fossils

636
00:51:49,739 --> 00:51:54,390
That's pretty good, but we already have a lot of that DNA

637
00:51:54,390 --> 00:51:56,819
let's sell this one and

638
00:51:56,819 --> 00:52:01,789
Extract from this one cuz higher-quality anyway, okay now that this is here. What can I do?

639
00:52:01,789 --> 00:52:11,460
Oh, I can sell my dinos now, but I don't want to sell my dinos. I'm guessing I should just get more

640
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:16,349
Right just incubate more dinos these are great

641
00:52:16,349 --> 00:52:21,630
Can these can Triceratops what what would happen right what would happen?

642
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:23,400
what happened if I put a

643
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,710
triceratops in

644
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:26,789
with

645
00:52:26,789 --> 00:52:31,249
Another dude, you think they'd be okay? Cuz this one's tiny. It's a tiny little baby

646
00:52:31,249 --> 00:52:36,420
It ain't gonna and I'm gonna do nothing. But if I want to start a fighting pit, he's gonna have camo

647
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:42,920
He's gonna have camo because he you don't even gonna see him tooth hardness. Oh, oh, he's gonna have some hard

648
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:50,420
Teeth Oh more attack on him. Oh, we're gonna have a fighting pit baby. Skin toughness. Oh, oh, yeah

649
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:54,210
oh wait, this one gives more defense though, but less viability I

650
00:52:54,210 --> 00:52:58,370
Like intensive repair, I like that or let's see if this one's gonna work

651
00:52:58,370 --> 00:53:00,720
I don't know if it's gonna work, but we're gonna try our best

652
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:05,930
I'm gonna try our best we're gonna get two of these bad boys going in here. Just in case. Oh, yeah

653
00:53:05,930 --> 00:53:10,310
Oh, yeah, Jeremy Michael Sarah. You're about to meet your match

654
00:53:10,310 --> 00:53:16,610
Oh, you're gonna see this strongly suggest you consider taking this contract. Okay. All right. Thank you

655
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:18,680
I don't know why but thank you

656
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:23,090
I think I'm already doing that aren't I what they already doing that so that's it's gonna be free money anyway

657
00:53:23,090 --> 00:53:28,890
All right. Let me see if I can get another contract

658
00:53:28,890 --> 00:53:33,050
Okay, ooh taking a picture from a feeder that might be cool so how do I do that

659
00:53:33,050 --> 00:53:35,610
And why is this not pumping out more?

660
00:53:35,610 --> 00:53:37,850
incubation Oh

661
00:53:37,850 --> 00:53:41,010
Did we

662
00:53:41,010 --> 00:53:45,090
Failed to incubate I

663
00:53:45,090 --> 00:53:47,940
Was gonna be easy

664
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:51,600
We'll try again I want two of them but this cost a lot of money

665
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,870
There's a lot of money that you're just pumping out on me

666
00:53:53,870 --> 00:53:56,870
Didn't I see something about like a picture being taken or something like that?

667
00:53:56,870 --> 00:54:02,130
Or was it the Ranger team that needed that I think it was the Ranger team?

668
00:54:02,130 --> 00:54:06,570
Uh-oh, I do have enough money for that. Okay, cuz I'm making so much

669
00:54:06,570 --> 00:54:09,330
Risks for now, you've done the first

670
00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:12,450
That is a job. Well done. Thank you

671
00:54:12,450 --> 00:54:14,130
Thank you

672
00:54:14,130 --> 00:54:15,660
Thank you

673
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:17,400
mM

674
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:19,140
million

675
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:25,530
I've got a new assignment that I think is perfect for your skill set right give it a once-over man

676
00:54:25,530 --> 00:54:28,350
Let me know if you're interested million

677
00:54:28,350 --> 00:54:29,490
million

678
00:54:29,490 --> 00:54:31,050
new you

679
00:54:31,050 --> 00:54:32,550
on board

680
00:54:32,550 --> 00:54:39,330
As you can imagine the animals and the various facilities are constantly probing for weaknesses in our security systems

681
00:54:39,330 --> 00:54:43,080
They're smarter and more devious than people give them credit for

682
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:46,650
But I refuse to underestimate their capabilities

683
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:51,570
That's why I'm always testing and evaluating our security protocols and barriers

684
00:54:51,570 --> 00:54:55,070
This is where you come in. I'm gonna give this guy Lambert his due

685
00:54:55,070 --> 00:54:59,810
He actually sees these animals as both opportunity and threat. Yeah

686
00:54:59,810 --> 00:55:01,950
yeah, that seems about right considering that they uh

687
00:55:01,950 --> 00:55:09,650
They're about to fight again. Need you to extract enough DNA from fossils to incubate and hatch a dinosaur. All right, you know what?

688
00:55:09,650 --> 00:55:16,640
I'm not gonna waste any more money. I'm gonna send I'm gonna send this guy out there. I'm gonna shave before I do that

689
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:18,990
we're gonna do like

690
00:55:18,990 --> 00:55:25,280
The that we're gonna call this one. How do I name it? Can I not insane? Okay, here we go my career

691
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:28,770
All right the calm before the wool

692
00:55:28,770 --> 00:55:32,190
The calm before I have no more characters

693
00:55:32,190 --> 00:55:36,830
Okay. All right. Here we go. All right. Let's do this release this Dino. All right you go

694
00:55:36,830 --> 00:55:41,300
Get them you go get them you go. You show em. What for? Oh, you're big. Oh, yeah

696
00:55:45,950 --> 00:55:51,830
No, see you face. You ain't know. Oh, yeah, you ain't no one to mess with. Oh, you ain't no one to mess with

697
00:55:51,830 --> 00:55:54,960
Oh, you ain't no one to mess with? Oh

698
00:55:54,960 --> 00:56:00,570
Fuck you Triceratops

699
00:56:00,570 --> 00:56:09,210
Oh, yeah, oh you shut up fake Chris Pratt. Oh, we're gonna call you I'm gonna call you Terry Terry Terry brews

700
00:56:09,210 --> 00:56:19,320
I'ma call you your name is Terry brews

701
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:25,710
Nothing how he has a fight between Michael Cera and Terry brew

702
00:56:25,710 --> 00:56:32,280
Hell yeah, yeah, oh yeah, oh fight fight baby fight

703
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:36,620
Fight everyone's looking at the fight. Oh, yeah. You're gonna run away little baby. Are you good?

704
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:42,990
Are you getting your ass handed to you? Oh, you're getting your ass handed to you. Oh, you're doing your ass destroy

705
00:56:42,990 --> 00:56:54,990
It's a new king of the jungle here. Oh, yeah, you might want to back down. Yeah Oh Terry bruised ain't looking for no mercy

706
00:56:54,990 --> 00:57:02,699
To set them right I believe in what we're doing and I believe these dinosaurs. No. Oh no teri, Bruce

707
00:57:02,699 --> 00:57:05,369
- Bruce strike a decisive blow

708
00:57:05,369 --> 00:57:12,180

719
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:03,660
Only one can win

720
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:07,850
Okay, let's make another dinosaur. All right, let's do let's do more of these big boys

We're just gonna make it like big boy land. This is just gonna be a big boy land

722
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:14,630
Do I have enough money for that? I barely do. Let's make it big boy land

723
00:58:14,630 --> 00:58:18,060
Do I have any more genomes that I can put in here? No?

724
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:22,560
No again yet. I need it if I pretend to be able to do dad

Creation laboratory before releasing and housing it in an enclosure

730
00:58:44,250 --> 00:58:48,830
You'll also want to make sure we've got an AC you presence on this island. Mm-hmm

731
00:58:48,830 --> 00:58:54,470
Okay, so you want me to make you want me to make one of these and then release it?

732
00:58:54,470 --> 00:58:59,870
Is that what you're saying now be very careful about what you're saying because I will do that man. They're gonna eat for days

733
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:01,020
I guess

734
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:03,780

741
00:59:30,210 --> 00:59:33,750
that's something that I needed to do photograph a

742
00:59:33,750 --> 00:59:36,090
How do we how do we do that?

743
00:59:36,090 --> 00:59:42,950
Ranger team add tasks. How do we how do we photograph something wasn't there a photograph? I'm gonna make a new enclosure

744
00:59:42,950 --> 00:59:47,640
I will make a nude enclosure, but I want to know how to photograph cuz that was definitely a thing

745
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:48,860
Well, you know

746
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:52,470
what I'm gonna do is I'm going to incubate one of these here because that's

747
00:59:52,470 --> 00:59:56,600
170 and if it works, then I'm gonna make a million. That's a pretty good return on my investment

748
00:59:56,600 --> 01:00:01,680
Even if it eats it picture is Ranger team. That's what I thought. So, how did they

749
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:05,239

What did I do? What dinosaurs your guests want to get up close and personal with?

760
01:00:46,009 --> 01:00:48,589
The thing is they can't

761
01:00:48,589 --> 01:00:55,579
Construct facilities to increase visibility and keep visitors the right side of the safety glass

762
01:00:55,579 --> 01:00:57,769

This is my new favorite thing about this is my new favorite thing

778
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:18,579
I had no idea that this was a part of the game. I had no idea. This is so fun

779
01:02:18,579 --> 01:02:21,049

All right, all right, here we go here we go, all right, good luck

All right, go get him buddy

786
01:03:15,289 --> 01:03:19,789
This next bit is gonna sound a little crazy because frankly it is

787
01:03:19,789 --> 01:03:24,409
But we are gonna encourage one of the dinosaurs to breach our containment grid

788
01:03:24,409 --> 01:03:30,169
Will then react and see if our procedures and personnel are up to the challenge?

789
01:03:30,169 --> 01:03:34,609
So at this point, I'd like to take back everything I just said about this yes. Yes. I love this man

Screwin square look the thing is we're still learning where our boundaries are when it comes to keeping these animals under control

854
01:08:41,630 --> 01:08:55,850
God knows they're working out ways to exploit our weaknesses. Yes. We'll find out who gets to the limits of our abilities first

855
01:08:55,850 --> 01:08:57,890
Complex

856
01:08:57,890 --> 01:09:08,330
Exploitation versus security, let's pretend that he's panicking violence, but he's panicking

857
01:09:08,330 --> 01:09:14,259
Just poor Eddie looks like Eddie might actually be able to survive because he's running away as fast as he can

858
01:09:14,259 --> 01:09:15,440
I

859
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:20,060
Think he's faster. So technically speaking. Maybe it'll be you know, okay

860
01:09:20,060 --> 01:09:23,989
Maybe it'll not be so bad. I think Eddie's hungry. We got to get another bait feeder

861
01:09:23,989 --> 01:09:30,049
But this one I think he's an herbivore. So let's build herbivore feeder over ha

862
01:09:30,049 --> 01:09:32,420
Maybe I should like divide it

863
01:09:32,420 --> 01:09:34,190
something

864
01:09:34,190 --> 01:09:42,170
That might be smart. I'll build another observation. Let me build another observation thing and then I'll build a

865
01:09:42,170 --> 01:09:46,130
Feeder right in front of it that

866
01:09:46,130 --> 01:09:49,420
Sounds pretty good poor Eddie poor poor, Eddie

867
01:09:49,420 --> 01:09:56,840
I mean, I don't think Eddie's gonna survive very long, but you know, I made probably a good idea

868
01:09:56,840 --> 01:10:02,989
Oh my god, oh boy Oh, finally oh

869
01:10:02,989 --> 01:10:05,210
Gosh, okay. Oh

870
01:10:05,210 --> 01:10:13,550
Yeah, it's a boy Eddie. That's a boy. His health is still going down probably because he's always food is down. Okay, Eddie you are

871
01:10:13,550 --> 01:10:18,520
You're a trooper. You're a trooper Eddie. How about I make another friend for you Eddie. Would you like that?

872
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:24,980
I bet you'd like that. I need to get power to this bad boy. Oh man, Eddie, you know what? I'm proud of you

873
01:10:24,980 --> 01:10:28,280
I'm really proud of you. You've shown us all

874
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:37,820
That life has more meaning than Joe

875
01:10:37,820 --> 01:10:39,170
Well

876
01:10:39,170 --> 01:10:45,190
This is uh, this is a bit awkward. There. He is. Okay. Eddie's doing better. Look at Eddie. Look at Eddie

877
01:10:45,190 --> 01:10:50,750
Look at Eddie. Look at Eddie. Let's build another Eddie. Let's build let's build more at ease

878
01:10:50,750 --> 01:10:54,050
Well, but maybe if I make it more aggressive

879
01:10:54,050 --> 01:10:59,469
Maybe if I make it more aggressive and we could really get something going here. Okay?

880
01:10:59,469 --> 01:11:05,570
We're gonna have three Eddie's let's actually a modify the genome because now it's not a waste of money. Let's give them more defense

881
01:11:05,570 --> 01:11:08,810
Let's do the defense and let's do

882
01:11:08,810 --> 01:11:12,440
Whatever. This is cardio strength

883
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:18,199
Sure. All right. Okay, you know they got no defense. This guy's gonna die

884
01:11:18,199 --> 01:11:42,880
But it'll be it'll be interesting to see anyway and two of those guys good. Oh, man, we just missed out on aggressive Joe

885
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:52,870
Maybe we should cancel the no cancel. Oh good it failed, you know

886
01:11:52,870 --> 01:11:56,590
Let's let's get that let's let's get

887
01:11:56,590 --> 01:12:03,250
Let's get let's just remove Eddie. Thank you. Can you remove Eddie? Can you get Eddie? Uh

888
01:12:03,250 --> 01:12:09,100
Can you get daddy out of there Eddie? Uh Eddie's dedi Eddie is varied, Eddie and Eddie

889
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:10,600
Eddie's, uh

890
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:15,820
Eddie has seen better days is just what I'm trying to say there Eddie is

891
01:12:15,820 --> 01:12:26,410
Yeah, electrified fences. That sounds pretty good. I think these guys are not only learning but they're getting more aggressive as Demi, okay?

892
01:12:26,410 --> 01:12:27,670
Oh

893
01:12:27,670 --> 01:12:29,080
God

894
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:35,260
Oh, no, it's so sad. Oh, no eyes his mouth thing, you know, but oh, it's so sad

895
01:12:35,260 --> 01:12:39,480
Oh, it's so sad. Oh, that's so sad

896
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:42,430
Oh, no

897
01:12:42,430 --> 01:12:48,190
Okay, bye, oh boy, oh, that's so sad, oh boy, I think we need more more

898
01:12:48,190 --> 01:12:49,570
more

899
01:12:49,570 --> 01:12:50,830
MORE

900
01:12:50,830 --> 01:12:55,630
Live bait feeder. Let's put this bad boy, right?

901
01:12:55,630 --> 01:12:57,550
Right. Um

902
01:12:57,550 --> 01:13:01,180
Too close to dinosaur. Yeah, you know probably

903
01:13:01,180 --> 01:13:06,370
Put that right there. Oh boy

904
01:13:06,370 --> 01:13:15,550
It's not funny it's not funny. Well, you know, it's even more funny here comes here comes Eddie with two DS not Eddie. Here's AD

905
01:13:15,550 --> 01:13:19,030
skip that because we're you are not gonna last long so

906
01:13:19,030 --> 01:13:21,670
let's just uh, this is um,

907
01:13:21,670 --> 01:13:24,990
Her toasted hurry up, please you you really need it skedaddle

908
01:13:24,990 --> 01:13:36,730
You are you you're wasting precious moments of your life right here right now. Add double D you are. Oh here comes that

909
01:13:36,730 --> 01:14:02,519
In Canada, I'll let you guess where the t-rex thinks. These are delicious

910
01:14:02,519 --> 01:14:06,179
Okay, I'm sorry just caught me off guard

911
01:14:06,179 --> 01:14:08,550
every time

912
01:14:08,550 --> 01:14:16,050
Every time they say something every time they say something it pertains to how I'm screwing everything up it pertains

913
01:14:16,050 --> 01:14:22,230
Exactly to how I'm ruining. These are these dinosaurs lives in horrible ways. Okay storm defense

914
01:14:22,230 --> 01:14:26,880
We've got that Andy e double D. Oh no. Oh

915
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:36,719
boy

916
01:14:36,719 --> 01:14:38,099
I

917
01:14:38,099 --> 01:14:41,159
Feel bad. Okay, we're gonna get

918
01:14:41,159 --> 01:14:45,590
Remove it remove double double D did not last long did not lessen

919
01:14:45,590 --> 01:14:51,869
the only reason now that I'm thinking that Eddy lasted so long is because the game wanted Eddie to escape and

920
01:14:51,869 --> 01:15:00,570
Yeah, that didn't go over well it let's extract and extract okay and let's build a hotel

921
01:15:00,570 --> 01:15:03,869
Hell, yeah, let's do it

922
01:15:03,869 --> 01:15:10,289
Alright, where can we build it? I don't know. Why is it obstructed? What's obstructing it?

923
01:15:10,289 --> 01:15:16,409
Is it the water can I terraform that there was a terraform? Oh, there was a terraforming thing

924
01:15:16,409 --> 01:15:18,510
see shrubs

925
01:15:18,510 --> 01:15:25,230
Well, that's now that's in the water that did that doesn't help me. Let's little flattened. Oh

926
01:15:25,230 --> 01:15:27,690
Wow

927
01:15:27,690 --> 01:15:31,590
Smooth that down a bit

928
01:15:31,590 --> 01:15:33,929
Smooth that

929
01:15:33,929 --> 01:15:38,880
That's better now. It should work now. We're gonna get a hotel

930
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:43,390
People are definitely one. I'm gonna want to stay here for a long

931
01:15:43,390 --> 01:15:48,200
Long time. Yeah, just a happy little accident

932
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:51,800
dinosaur escaping happy little accident

933
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:55,970
Alright. Hey, we got it. No, it's only viewable now. We need more

934
01:15:55,970 --> 01:15:59,480
We need more. Alright, so we got that

935
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:06,260
Guests are gonna be happy. We're making moolah. We're making so much money go. We're making so much money. Oh look at us

936
01:16:06,260 --> 01:16:08,270
Look at us all

937
01:16:08,270 --> 01:16:14,450
Right. We need a picture of a dinosaur eating from a feeder. So let's get the Jeep crew out there again

938
01:16:14,450 --> 01:16:16,010
boo, boo

939
01:16:16,010 --> 01:16:17,240

Whoa, okay ramp wasn't there before. Excuse me

942
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:29,410
Excuse me. Okay. I'm pumping out goats, like it's my job

943
01:16:29,410 --> 01:16:33,880
I don't know how many more goats I can get out here. Someone need a damn goat

944
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:38,420
How many goats can I get out of here how many goddamn goats do you need?

945
01:16:38,420 --> 01:16:41,870
Dude, oh, yeah, he's locked on target. Yeah

946
01:16:41,870 --> 01:16:47,270
No, no. No, you don't need you. Don't need me. Come on. What are you thinking you want to go?

947
01:16:47,270 --> 01:16:53,290
I'm sorry. Okay, Wow. All right Wow. Rude Oh Oh get it go get it go you getting to go. You're gonna go

948
01:16:53,290 --> 01:16:55,160
Hang on I need a picture of it

949
01:16:55,160 --> 01:16:57,470
No weird

950
01:16:57,470 --> 01:17:02,450
If I can chase down a goat, oh, I can't it won't let me run over a goat it

951
01:17:02,450 --> 01:17:11,090
Keeps slowing down right in the middle of it. Uh-huh. I need a picture eat a damn goat there goes. No Oh hate it. Oh

952
01:17:11,090 --> 01:17:14,330
Yes. Oh, it's going for it. He's going for it

953
01:17:14,330 --> 01:17:31,010
Yes. Ah, that's good one nice

954
01:17:31,010 --> 01:17:34,880
Even when that means they want to kill

955
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:39,290
Okay, all right, thank you fake Chris Pratt, thank you so much get all the way

956
01:17:39,290 --> 01:17:40,760
Look out

957
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:44,360
The dinosaurs somewhere. I don't know I

958
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:46,460
Shouldn't have terraformed here. Whoa

959
01:17:46,460 --> 01:17:52,880
Oh boy, excuse me. Pardon me. Pardon me. No one's diving out of the way, which they should be

960
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:55,940
Yeah, I got it. Cool. All right

961
01:17:55,940 --> 01:18:02,660
We got our hotel up and run hotel - does it remember the little the loss of hotel one?

962
01:18:02,660 --> 01:18:04,430
Remembers Oh

963
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:11,300
What does this mean building? Can I upgrade the knot the gate? Can I upgrade the fences upgrade mode?

964
01:18:11,300 --> 01:18:15,770
Replace on can I replace?

965
01:18:15,770 --> 01:18:21,790
Whoa, okay. Well, that's expensive. Oh my god, that is expensive - close - dinosaur

966
01:18:21,790 --> 01:18:23,080
Oh not enough power

967
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:30,050
Anyway, well I did something so I feel good about that, but I didn't do a lot of something our view fossils

968
01:18:30,050 --> 01:18:38,510
Let's extract you. Let's suck you out of there. That's what I did

969
01:18:38,510 --> 01:18:44,020
How do I research the gyro platform I want to do that what do I need unlock conditions not met

970
01:18:44,020 --> 01:18:46,330
Oh, I need to get the entertainment up

971
01:18:46,330 --> 01:18:49,670
Well, how do I get I can't be entertainment up until I get the right things

972
01:18:49,670 --> 01:18:55,820
Well, you want me to make another dinosaur pen do I really have to do that?

973
01:18:55,820 --> 01:19:01,900
All right, I guess I have to do that then it's making me so how do I do that, huh?

974
01:19:01,900 --> 01:19:06,860
I don't exactly have a lot of space here. Oh, I guess I got spaced out here

975
01:19:06,860 --> 01:19:08,080
This job ain't easy

976
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:15,410
But then it's not supposed to be we are reshaping the world one exhibit feeding time show at a time

977
01:19:15,410 --> 01:19:19,820
This genome thing was solid. Oh

978
01:19:19,820 --> 01:19:22,190
Thanks, man, that makes me feel so good

979
01:19:22,190 --> 01:19:28,280
Thank you. We're gonna make big changes here. We're gonna we're going to terraform this whole area

980
01:19:28,280 --> 01:19:36,320
We're gonna turn it into the next area that we're gonna have let's smooth it out smooth

981
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:41,210
Nice and smooth. Okay. Let's get rid of the trees

982
01:19:41,210 --> 01:19:42,830
BAM

983
01:19:42,830 --> 01:19:48,949
Eco-terrorists here. They it's gonna be the this is gonna be the herbivore area. There's gonna be the the baby dinosaur land

984
01:19:48,949 --> 01:19:50,179
You know how it is

985
01:19:50,179 --> 01:19:58,730
okay, we're gonna once I once I define the lake the actual like fence line, then I'm gonna come in and then I'm gonna actually

986
01:19:58,730 --> 01:20:01,960
Make it prettier. I'm gonna make it nicer. I am I am going to do that

987
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:09,560
I'm a nice guy who likes nice things and this nice guy is gonna make it real nice

988
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:12,380
No, we're gonna delete this

989
01:20:12,380 --> 01:20:15,730
And we're gonna we're gonna take advantage of a bit more land here

990
01:20:15,730 --> 01:20:18,489
We're gonna because I don't need to do all of that just yet

991
01:20:18,489 --> 01:20:20,870
we can have these blood and up against each other a

992
01:20:20,870 --> 01:20:25,750
Little bit which might be a bad idea considering that these dinosaurs probably don't want to do that

993
01:20:25,750 --> 01:20:28,310
But you know it is what it whoa. Oh

994
01:20:28,310 --> 01:20:37,280
The bird. Oh, no, the bird all the birds those poor family. No. Wish we bought a map

995
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:42,170
Yes, that's what's gonna be okay, oh

996
01:20:42,170 --> 01:20:44,090
Okay, sure

997
01:20:44,090 --> 01:20:48,350
Why not? Why?

998
01:20:48,350 --> 01:20:55,150
This opportunity pass you by what what what what what what kind of ominous bullshit was there

999
01:20:55,150 --> 01:21:01,070
What the hell don't don't let this opportunity to pass me by why what what the hell?

1000
01:21:01,070 --> 01:21:07,699
That was creepy, okay. All right. Well then all right now we're gonna build a fence line and

1001
01:21:07,699 --> 01:21:11,060
It's going to be

1002
01:21:11,060 --> 01:21:14,210
Cool where where's like the UH

1003
01:21:14,210 --> 01:21:17,449
Was like that defining part of the fence. Where do I?

1004
01:21:17,449 --> 01:21:24,310
wait, should I built a fence first and then built does research center that feels like it may have been a little bit of a

1005
01:21:24,310 --> 01:21:28,550
Better choice, or maybe I gotta wait until it's done. Yeah, either way. I know it's gonna be

1006
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:34,610
Okay, it's done now. So oh the fence there it is. Okay. This is the fence line cool. All right, so the fence

1007
01:21:34,610 --> 01:21:41,360
We're gonna start with like an electric food too expensive. We're gonna start with in the light steel fence. These are nice creatures there

1008
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:45,020
There's nothing to worry about how do you curve something by the way?

1009
01:21:45,020 --> 01:21:52,219
Cuz if I want to do a nice curve like that, how do I curve it? How do I space?

1010
01:21:52,219 --> 01:21:59,300
Oh wait, it says it says right on the instructions, oops, I'm dumb. Okay. Alright, that's fine, though

1011
01:21:59,300 --> 01:22:06,890
I can't see where it is. But I'm assuming that it's all Gucci. Yeah, it's Gucci. There we go

1012
01:22:06,890 --> 01:22:10,950
We would want just a straight normal boring fence. I

1013
01:22:10,950 --> 01:22:14,489
Mean me but whatever

1014
01:22:14,489 --> 01:22:23,370
Oops, whew I missed my target. Okay, let's hang on get rid of that

1015
01:22:23,370 --> 01:22:29,450
Yeah, it's good enough that's probably that is adding is that enclosed that doesn't not that does not look enclosed

1016
01:22:29,450 --> 01:22:34,739
Okay, let's get rid of the trees here so I can actually see what's going on. You're gonna go there

1017
01:22:34,739 --> 01:22:35,820
nice

1018
01:22:35,820 --> 01:22:44,250
There we go. Okay. Now we got oh, that's a nice space. That's nice space. Okay, so we're gonna have a nice little pond

1019
01:22:44,250 --> 01:22:48,200
At the bottom and we're gonna actually make a divot first. We're gonna lower this

1020
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:50,790
It's gonna be a nice pond at the base of this hill

1021
01:22:50,790 --> 01:22:54,330
like if I could build a waterfall in this I would you know, I would

1022
01:22:54,330 --> 01:22:58,050
Okay, that's as low as it can go apparently and add water

1023
01:22:58,050 --> 01:23:01,170
Oh, it just split. Oh it

1024
01:23:01,170 --> 01:23:04,220
Well, it kind of there goes my plan, huh? Well there there there

1025
01:23:04,220 --> 01:23:09,270
There's my plans is kind of out the window because you were too much of an asshole that consider my feelings

1026
01:23:09,270 --> 01:23:13,860
Or whatever that looks good. I guess it looks good. Whatever

1027
01:23:13,860 --> 01:23:20,630
Okay, let's add some shrubbery along the banks there along the banks there. Oh, yeah, this is good stuff good

1028
01:23:20,630 --> 01:23:26,160
It's looking a little sparse up here. Let's let's uh, let's fill that in. Yeah, that looks good there

1029
01:23:26,160 --> 01:23:28,440
And we got a lonely tree over here

1030
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:29,930
Nothing to worry about alright

1031
01:23:29,930 --> 01:23:34,890
Then we're gonna make two observation centers one here on the left and then one

1032
01:23:34,890 --> 01:23:38,880
here on the right see how I do it's

1033
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:42,780
Beautiful. Oh, yeah. There we go now

1034
01:23:42,780 --> 01:23:45,060
We're in business. Oh

1035
01:23:45,060 --> 01:23:50,340
I love that curved. I love that curved. I love that curved

1036
01:23:50,340 --> 01:23:58,350
Okay, this is looking wonderful. Does looking wonderful. All we got to do is incubate some nice

1037
01:23:58,350 --> 01:24:02,810
Eddies do we actually want Eddie's doing is is any what we want is that he actually what we want

1038
01:24:02,810 --> 01:24:07,190
I have no idea of Eddie's actually what we want. Oh, this is not connected to that. Oh, that's why it's problem

1039
01:24:07,190 --> 01:24:10,260
Oh, we're right. We're out of power. Okay

1040
01:24:10,260 --> 01:24:13,960
shit

1041
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:21,099
Disease I just put down power, how am I disease? Oh wait. No, it's because there's no power. Oh

1042

Opportunity for you to consider it will allow us to work together to create life

1052
01:25:07,030 --> 01:25:14,469
Pure life if you've been listening to dr. Malcolm, then you know how important this is to us and to me

Welp I guess we're done controlling that woman. Okay, so no power here

1074
01:27:22,740 --> 01:27:28,840
We need to put in the upgrade module we have that we need to put an improved outage protection

1075
01:27:28,840 --> 01:27:33,850
by and then output protection or in

1076
01:27:33,850 --> 01:27:41,530
Producing yeah, you guys understood both saying right? Yeah. I can name the hotel are on call this one. Um

1077
01:27:41,530 --> 01:27:48,040
Sanic Dino fucking look out

1079
01:27:54,700 --> 01:28:01,450
Triceratops, right. That's what we need cuz I can get Triceratops. Yeah looks pretty good. I'm pretty sure that's that's gonna be fine

1080
01:28:01,450 --> 01:28:06,930
Have I gave this guy modified genome, right? Yayi? Oh, yeah. Yeah, I did. Okay

1081
01:28:06,930 --> 01:28:11,360
Let's get two of those bad boys going one of them probably gonna fail

1082
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:18,630
Come up, that could be interesting

1083
01:28:18,630 --> 01:28:24,500
One thing we like here it's money I always like to money

1084
01:28:24,500 --> 01:28:24,860
Yeah

1085
01:28:24,860 --> 01:28:30,270
I want to get another expedition Center or I want to figure out a way to upgrade this so that I can have more expeditions

1086
01:28:30,270 --> 01:28:32,430
Maybe I'll research something along those lines

1087
01:28:32,430 --> 01:28:37,110
Hey get the smart people all in a room and let's actually try to do something with our lives

1088
01:28:37,110 --> 01:28:39,090
Okay, so we need to get more

1089
01:28:39,090 --> 01:28:42,930
We need to get more bullshit going before we're actually able to do anything

1090
01:28:42,930 --> 01:28:47,780
Well success rate. Oh that did that's really good. Yeah, I've been having some bad successes lately

1091
01:28:47,780 --> 01:28:52,320
So if I can get more, that'd be I'll be really worth it. All these dinos keep dying on me

1092
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:55,980
Alright, where's the Triceratops? There he is

1093
01:28:55,980 --> 01:29:04,800
Let's go to hell Creek. I like the sound of help Creek really matches up with the kind of hell that we're in right now

1094
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:07,770
Oh

1118
01:30:57,319 --> 01:31:01,189

01:31:29,769 --> 01:31:34,069
But I'm not gonna drive it over again until I get more in there and then I know that I'm gonna need them

1126
01:31:34,069 --> 01:31:37,039
Okay, maybe I should get more of those things

1127

maybe I should get more of those

1128
01:31:39,739 --> 01:31:47,989
I mean more is good. Right? More is definitely gonna be good. There's no way that having more of these things is in any way bad

There's Meemoo. All right, cool

1133
01:32:13,399 --> 01:32:21,799
Oh, it's eating. Oh, no, go go go go go go. We got to go take it take it take it take it. Boom

1134
01:32:21,799 --> 01:32:28,480
Got it

1135
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:36,770
Oh man, I always make myself look good if there's one thing that I do it's look good at literally all times. All right. Ah

1136
01:32:36,770 --> 01:32:53,870
Dad, okay. Let's make another one of these things. Let's make another big goofy, dude. All right, that one's gonna be ad with 1d

1137
01:32:53,870 --> 01:32:56,120
Whoa, that is gross

1138
01:32:56,120 --> 01:33:01,630
Whoo, we can make a hang. Yeah. Oh go go me move go mo mo

One only Mamu mo. Mo me me my mo

1143
01:33:19,880 --> 01:33:27,219
Mumbly and then me incubate we're almost to the Triceratops DNA. We just need one last expedition with it to be able to go

1144
01:33:27,219 --> 01:33:34,000
Oh, yeah, release it. Oh, this one's Ed! Edie the loner always by yourself no friends anywhere

1145
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:42,350
Oh you big dumb doofy. Looking Dino. Oh, look at this stupid ass face, huh? It's dumbass Dino the survived herd. Oh

1146
01:33:42,350 --> 01:33:45,640
I've heard that there's horrible monsters here

1147
01:33:45,640 --> 01:33:54,350
Oh, I hope I hope not Oh God, where are my friends? Where's double D. And this one's just had

1148
01:33:54,350 --> 01:34:06,380
Its add. Oh boy

1149
01:34:06,380 --> 01:34:12,260
Yes sightsee more commonly known as Aslam Huerta a

1150
01:34:12,260 --> 01:34:18,320
Newly developed island the name roughly translated that I do mean roughly the island

1151
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:22,250
of the Dead mmm fitting

1152
01:34:22,250 --> 01:34:27,110
humorous even humorous even humorous Oh

1153
01:34:27,110 --> 01:34:31,010
Humorous. All right. Should we go should we go to the new island?

1154
01:34:31,010 --> 01:34:35,989
You guys think we should go to the new island? Yeah, you guys think we should go to death Island. Oh

1155
01:34:35,989 --> 01:34:46,040
Yeah, no preach for mark because I'm a big bully

1156
01:34:46,040 --> 01:34:58,670
I feel unprepared

1157
01:34:58,670 --> 01:35:28,820
And restores as they can cause terrible devastation to your island operations

1158
01:35:28,820 --> 01:35:34,420
Any damage this storm is caused you should use a ranger team to get the park operational again

1159
01:35:34,420 --> 01:35:45,350
Oh and don't forget to close any emergency shelters when it's safe to do so

1160
01:35:45,350 --> 01:35:51,409
There's been quite the storm and it seems that bad weather is often a precursor to bad behavior

1161
01:35:51,409 --> 01:35:57,370
From the dinosaurs if you believe that everything is connected the so called butterfly effect

1162
01:35:57,370 --> 01:36:04,460
And I do believe it. By the way, then one small change is all it takes to create a series of toppling dominoes

1163
01:36:04,460 --> 01:36:08,060
Leading to rampaging dinosaurs

1164
01:36:08,060 --> 01:36:11,820
Don't make a butterfly net big enough to stop him, okay?

1165
01:36:11,820 --> 01:36:17,340
Thank you. Jeff goldblum. Thank you for that. All right, we're gonna get a ranger team. I guess looks expensive

1166
01:36:17,340 --> 01:36:19,050
You should get that fixed

1167
01:36:19,050 --> 01:36:22,140
Soon. All right, okay

1168
01:36:22,140 --> 01:36:28,250
Do I shoot darts at the building? All right, you bugged it fixed here weak. All right that ought to do it

1169
01:36:28,250 --> 01:36:35,160
Okay, let me fix that AC unit. All right got that one. This tower looks in need of repair boink. Oh, it's unpowered

1170
01:36:35,160 --> 01:36:38,010
Oh, that's the only problem with it. Okay, well

1171
01:36:38,010 --> 01:36:41,670
Let's technically got a substation. We just need to repair the substation

1172
01:36:41,670 --> 01:36:57,240
Okay, I did I miss something because I have no idea how to repair a substation. Hmm

1173
01:36:57,240 --> 01:37:03,950
Maybe I got a Oh, maybe I got drive this too because this wasn't dis repaired. It was whose is not powered

1174
01:37:03,950 --> 01:37:11,520
So maybe I go to the Oh

1175
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:18,330
Why couldn't I go forward there well that made no sense, okay, whatever repair that repair in progress

1176
01:37:18,330 --> 01:37:24,510
Okay, we got that. All right, I still think my old dart method should have been the one that was actually gonna get it. Oh

1177
01:37:24,510 --> 01:37:27,660
That ain't good

1178
01:37:27,660 --> 01:37:31,320
Okay, that's good

1179
01:37:31,320 --> 01:37:34,290
Okay all done oh

1180
01:37:34,290 --> 01:37:37,430
Good job. Well done. I'll leave them there. They can make their way back home

1181
01:37:37,430 --> 01:37:44,619
So we got all that repair and then we need to close shelter clothes all shelter

1182
01:37:44,619 --> 01:37:48,980
a

1183
01:37:48,980 --> 01:37:52,400
Recent handling of anomalous events as if like it wasn't what was it? Not good

1184
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:57,409
Did we not do good did would did we do it badly? So what we're gonna do is

1185
01:37:57,409 --> 01:38:02,929
We need to get some dinos going. Do I still have all of my do I still have all my yeah, I do

1186
01:38:02,929 --> 01:38:08,449
All right, we're gonna make one and just truth the Moto X truth II me omus

1187
01:38:08,449 --> 01:38:16,820
Only we're gonna just have like out the wazoo of how many screw me. Oh those those we have we're gonna have so

1188
01:38:16,820 --> 01:38:17,869
many

1189
01:38:17,869 --> 01:38:23,389
Stream you memos. Okay. We also need to get the actual

1190
01:38:23,389 --> 01:38:26,750
expedition Center going we need an expedition soon to

1191
01:38:26,750 --> 01:38:33,320
Have all this wait, where's the edge of our okay, we don't want to build too far over there. Let's make let's

1192
01:38:33,320 --> 01:38:39,949
intelligently think about where we want all of our stuff and I am intelligently thinking that wow this Islands

1193
01:38:39,949 --> 01:38:46,099
Whoa, this Islands bit. Oh my god. This is oh my god. Oh my god

1194
01:38:46,099 --> 01:38:52,130
okay, this Islands huge so I don't want to build over there because I'm obviously gonna expand over there I think here is

1195
01:38:52,130 --> 01:38:57,409
Probably my best bet for keeping things relatively in line with one another

1196
01:38:57,409 --> 01:39:05,540
Okay, and but do ski the fossil centre to be able to produce those. We need to build a road to get over there

1197
01:39:05,540 --> 01:39:07,849
Probably let's build a nice

1198
01:39:07,849 --> 01:39:09,830
curvy boy

1199
01:39:09,830 --> 01:39:16,670
Yeah. Oh that looks nice. Oh, no one can tell me that don't look nice because that looks nice

1200
01:39:16,670 --> 01:39:22,369
Other nice. Okay. We've got a fossil centre curvy boy

1201
01:39:22,369 --> 01:39:28,489
Okay, good. We got that fossil centers going up. Let's go ahead and extend out those boodoo shion's

1202
01:39:28,489 --> 01:39:35,960
Nice new fossils discovered Helen. Yeah, go for that. Alright, go get get out of here. Just get out here

1203
01:39:35,960 --> 01:39:42,820
Just get out of here release the Dinos. Yes me Moo and Mama are back back in business. Shut up

1204
01:39:42,820 --> 01:39:50,630
All right release the other one and skip it as well because I just I can't be bothered. You're me Moo. Okay, that's me, Moo

1205
01:39:50,630 --> 01:39:56,360
Yeah, the ones mom Oh, are we releasing the other one is is happening. Oh, oh

1206
01:39:56,360 --> 01:39:57,949
Hi

1207
01:39:57,949 --> 01:40:04,750
Hey Momo, I'm stuck on you. I guess we literally can't do anything until you're done doing your freakin stupid bullshit

1208
01:40:04,750 --> 01:40:10,309
All right, Momo. You freaking drama queen. All right. There's Momo. Let's get two more going and

1209
01:40:10,309 --> 01:40:11,989
Flump. Oh here

1210
01:40:11,989 --> 01:40:19,099
All right, that's gonna be mu MO and mumbly what we need. What we need is a burger stall and that's what we need

1211
01:40:19,099 --> 01:40:25,309
That seems like ideal priority. It's my minor curvy boy. Oh release the Dyna. I just don't care

1212
01:40:25,309 --> 01:40:29,239
Okay, release the Dinos. Okay, those are getting released. I'll name them when they're done

1213
01:40:29,239 --> 01:40:32,000
we need

1214
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:35,000
We're running low on money but not that low

1215
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,159
Research center okay there

1216
01:40:37,159 --> 01:40:37,960
All right

1217
01:40:37,960 --> 01:40:41,300
And then a road and then we are good on the operations bullshit

1218
01:40:41,300 --> 01:40:46,670
The stuff that nobody cares about we are good to go on that one. All right, cool. Look at him run

1219
01:40:46,670 --> 01:40:48,800
We need to get them food

1220
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:52,659
Ground herbivore. That sounds pretty good. All right

1221
01:40:52,659 --> 01:40:55,219
Oh those were expensive why so expensive?

1222
01:40:55,219 --> 01:41:01,880
Maybe because you're supposed to only need one and I accidentally bought like ten billion of them under construction power consumption

1223
01:41:01,880 --> 01:41:07,449
We need more power. Okay, so we're gonna need to get a more powerful power. I have no money. I have no money

1224
01:41:07,449 --> 01:41:14,030
I don't have more money. Hello

1225
01:41:14,030 --> 01:41:16,130
Okay, cool, thank you. Oh

1226
01:41:16,130 --> 01:41:19,760
Man, it's not even 2:00 yet. I'm not broke

1227
01:41:19,760 --> 01:41:23,889
Look at revenue is a little downed admittedly, but you know, it's it's fine

1228
01:41:23,889 --> 01:41:31,369
I'm gonna drive this Ranger team into the enclosure and you're gonna see I'm gonna get money by the way

1229
01:41:31,369 --> 01:41:33,139
Babe, babe, babe

1230
01:41:33,139 --> 01:41:37,000
No, it's not an emergency. But I feel like rushing. Anyway, we're oh he was on the other side

1231
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:40,789
All right, get ready to get your picture to can here we go

1232
01:41:40,789 --> 01:41:48,500
Picture taken BAM. Gotcha

1233
01:41:48,500 --> 01:41:54,619
You guys gonna eat can I get one of you eating that'd be cool that'd be profitable. All right fine. What are you losers?

1234
01:41:54,619 --> 01:41:57,849
Whatever get out of here. Okay, that was a little bit of money, but not even remotely worth it

1235
01:41:57,849 --> 01:42:01,099
Let's make two more of these bad boys spend our money

1236
01:42:01,099 --> 01:42:07,840
Don none of these should fail they better not fail if they fail to be real pissed

1237
01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:17,080
You got to shut up I already know what I'm doing damn baby, okay easy peasy easy money

1238
01:42:17,080 --> 01:42:23,200
Thank you, alright shut up, okay. Wait, oh wait I got I got a name these guys. Okay your your amumu

1239
01:42:23,200 --> 01:42:26,650
This one's moo moo. We got me moo moo moo moo

1240
01:42:26,650 --> 01:42:30,010
Where's the other one there? You're okay. You're gonna be

1241
01:42:30,010 --> 01:42:35,190
Moo me you're gonna be Moo me your moo me your mo moo. This is mo moo everybody

1242
01:42:35,190 --> 01:42:38,260
Say Adam Oh, Moo, and this you are

1243
01:42:38,260 --> 01:42:44,800
Your army me. Okay, so we got moo moo mo. Mo. Mo moo moo me me me and me, Moo

1244
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:47,730
There's gonna be a quiz on this you bet you got this better get this, right?

1245
01:42:47,730 --> 01:42:53,040
You got to memorize this me Moo mee mee, mo moo moo moo moo moo and mo mo

1246
01:42:53,040 --> 01:43:00,820
I don't like how they're all targeter each other. That's a

1247
01:43:00,820 --> 01:43:02,080
Good idea

1248
01:43:02,080 --> 01:43:08,140
But alas, oh wait this requires. This hasn't been powered this whole time. Well, that's why people couldn't even see that

1249
01:43:08,140 --> 01:43:13,230
We need power. Anyway, maybe that wasn't the power area, but it just didn't have enough power for it because I have no money

1250
01:43:13,230 --> 01:43:16,680
That's right. I was trying to get money for them. Then I was going on building other stuff. Why was I doing that?

1251
01:43:16,680 --> 01:43:20,410
Oh and there's no power. There you whelp. I

1252
01:43:20,410 --> 01:43:24,940
Seemed to be in a bit of a conundrum here. I can't get power shut

1253
01:43:24,940 --> 01:43:27,370
the fast food down

1254
01:43:27,370 --> 01:43:32,910
I'm sorry. We got it. We got to turn it off to --safe there enough power so we can get nope

1255
01:43:32,910 --> 01:43:38,880
We can't get an expedition which is the only thing that needs mother that we need for money. So let's turn off the writ

1256
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:43,660
Let's get the fast food God people are gonna be real pissed if they were doing that food here. Alright, so we got that

1257
01:43:43,660 --> 01:43:50,760
Give me power. Why do I not have power? Okay, this doesn't need to be powered right now. There's nothing to see over there

1258
01:43:50,760 --> 01:43:53,580
So we're gonna deactivate that everybody. Hold on. This is all worth it

1259
01:43:53,580 --> 01:44:00,430
We definitely don't need to power this thing get that get that shit gone. Alright now we can cook it

1260
01:44:00,430 --> 01:44:09,580
Now we can go

1261
01:44:09,580 --> 01:44:14,620
Put Veloso Roop ders on the opposite side of the

1262
01:44:14,620 --> 01:44:18,190
Me mu and Momo's and Momo's and mee mo mo Mo's

1263
01:44:18,190 --> 01:44:23,130
That we need so that they can just see him for across this fence and just be like, oh my god

1264
01:44:23,130 --> 01:44:31,840
There's food over there. There's so much food. It's just this endless endless food. So we're gonna get a new contract we need

1265
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:37,630
science

1266
01:44:37,630 --> 01:44:43,210
Me is it me are you going to give me money? Cuz that's all I really care about money

1267
01:44:43,210 --> 01:44:49,630
We're just kind of stuck for a bit because I just kept it kept spending too much money. I just need more power

1268
01:44:49,630 --> 01:44:55,170
That's all I need. I just need wait. It says unused power 11 Oh probably cuz I shut those down wait

1269
01:44:55,170 --> 01:44:57,100
Why did I need power in the first place?

1270
01:44:57,100 --> 01:45:02,800
We wouldn't I need power for again. I don't need power. I've got power I

1271
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:07,840
Think what about my other Island? Can I just go to the other Island? Is that something I can do?

1272
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:11,400
No, I don't think that I don't think you can do that. It's like playing a theme-park game

1273
01:45:11,400 --> 01:45:13,780
You got only one Park at a time, right?

1274
01:45:13,780 --> 01:45:20,830
Blue blue. Oh well, hello. Are you all right there?

1275
01:45:20,830 --> 01:45:22,720
Hello, how are you?

1276
01:45:22,720 --> 01:45:24,790
No dice. Oh

1277
01:45:24,790 --> 01:45:30,690
No matter what. I think I just I can't figure it out. There's no dinos in this picture. Well, that's a good pick

1278
01:45:30,690 --> 01:45:36,520
Oh, that's a good pick. Give me my money. Give me money

1279
01:45:36,520 --> 01:45:41,890
$24 perfect. I'm gonna get there eventually Oh lunch, please munch munch. I need the munch

1280
01:45:41,890 --> 01:45:47,380
Yes, lunch munch crunch and munch crunch it

1281
01:45:47,380 --> 01:45:49,180
Crunch

1282
01:45:49,180 --> 01:45:54,140
Yeah

1283
01:45:54,140 --> 01:45:59,390
This is bullshit, I deserve more money than this all my expeditions back

1284
01:45:59,390 --> 01:46:02,360
Okay, good. Alright, we need to send people off to

1285
01:46:02,360 --> 01:46:08,840
More velociraptor and then we need to research the velociraptor. Well, yeah this no

1286
01:46:08,840 --> 01:46:14,600
No, oh we got some amber. Oh, yeah a gift shop

1287
01:46:14,600 --> 01:46:16,670
Hell, yeah

1288
01:46:16,670 --> 01:46:24,460
You know, that's what people want. They're right by the emergency shelters. So no one needs to be worried when they're in the shelter

1289
01:46:24,460 --> 01:46:28,540
They can still get their shop on I kind of spent too much money on the operation

1290
01:46:28,540 --> 01:46:34,790
So I'm gonna go and I'm gonna demolish this guy get the money back. We don't need that let the mother humper burn

1291
01:46:34,790 --> 01:46:37,850
What we do need is more dinos

1292
01:46:37,850 --> 01:46:43,700
That's what I know for a fact. So let's incubate some more of these guys and

1293
01:46:43,700 --> 01:46:49,840
We'll be real good cuz I don't think those guys are gonna be like any sort of a threat to me, right? Okay

1294
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:50,930
alright, I'm gonna

1295
01:46:50,930 --> 01:46:59,240
Release those and we're gonna name them if I can get to him

1296
01:46:59,240 --> 01:47:05,210
Okay, alright sure whatever you say man we need mommy mommy, okay, mommy. Okay you

1297
01:47:05,210 --> 01:47:06,410
you're

1298
01:47:06,410 --> 01:47:12,520
This is Steve. Okay, so we got moo moo. Mommy me Moo me me mow

1299
01:47:12,520 --> 01:47:17,080
Mow Moo me and Steve. Okay, everybody got those remember there's gonna be a test

1300
01:47:17,080 --> 01:47:21,710
You better be brushed up on what you got going on here. So we need

1301
01:47:21,710 --> 01:47:32,810
To research these. Oh, yes, so

1302
01:47:32,810 --> 01:47:36,230
Oh hell yeah my guys

1303
01:47:36,230 --> 01:47:38,630
day, oh

1304
01:47:38,630 --> 01:47:40,060
I'm so proud of you

1305
01:47:40,060 --> 01:47:45,560
Okay, but what we need to do is we need to eventually I don't know how much we're gonna get out of this one

1306
01:47:45,560 --> 01:47:50,870
We may be able to try to make a velociraptor, but it's probably gonna end up in failure if we don't get it, right?

1307
01:47:50,870 --> 01:47:52,580
so you

1308
01:47:52,580 --> 01:47:57,430
Wanna risk it if we're not gonna get it up to the air, but you never know with anything that we got going on

1309
01:47:57,430 --> 01:48:02,030
So that's not actually the t-rex, by the way, for those of you who are thinking those deer eggs less time

1310
01:48:02,030 --> 01:48:06,410
Stupid wrong. I think this is the t-rex. It's a doll

1311
01:48:06,410 --> 01:48:10,880
Don't know. That's the t-rex

1312
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:11,900
Oh

1313
01:48:11,900 --> 01:48:16,150
Look there we don't want a picture of that. I want a picture of that. Hang on everybody all the way

1314
01:48:16,150 --> 01:48:21,410
Here we go. Here we go. All right zoom and uh,

1315
01:48:21,410 --> 01:48:30,740
Yes, No, are you are you fucking kidding me okay, here we go

1316
01:48:30,740 --> 01:48:32,090
Yes

1317
01:48:32,090 --> 01:48:33,380
Yes

1318
01:48:33,380 --> 01:48:35,060
Look at the money

1319
01:48:35,060 --> 01:48:38,120
That's some good money. Oh, yeah

1320
01:48:38,120 --> 01:48:43,390
Give me that money. It's the same picture over and over again. Okay, cool

1321
01:48:43,390 --> 01:48:49,610
All right. That's all I needed now, they're back and that's good. We need more of a Lucy roopd and

1322
01:48:49,610 --> 01:48:52,490
Let's fossil them up

1323
01:48:52,490 --> 01:48:58,390
Okay, extract and it's shitty quality. Let's just sell that one and soon as we get those done

1324
01:48:58,390 --> 01:49:01,990
We should be able to do that. We can build another power station now, which is good. I'm gonna do that

1325
01:49:01,990 --> 01:49:05,710
We got that we got good power over there. We got good power over here

1326
01:49:05,710 --> 01:49:10,960
We can start unlocking this stuff or you can activate that as soon as well

1327
01:49:10,960 --> 01:49:14,810
We're not gonna have power for it, but we can activate it so that we will have power eventually

1328
01:49:14,810 --> 01:49:23,450
We have those dinos over there the ratings not the best in the world one else. Could we make we need clothes?

1329
01:49:23,450 --> 01:49:25,660
Hell yeah

1330
01:49:25,660 --> 01:49:33,350
Okay. All right. Got it. Okay, as soon as you're done and more velociraptor

1331
01:49:33,350 --> 01:49:35,000
Go

1332
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,430
Go go. There we go. Okay

1333
01:49:37,430 --> 01:49:43,790
Well, we didn't even get to go to the bathroom. So how much does it cost to make a Veloso room?

1334
01:49:43,790 --> 01:49:49,180
How much

1335
01:49:49,180 --> 01:49:55,750
Are you dicking me? That's more than a sirota tops

1336
01:49:55,750 --> 01:50:03,310
In what world and what in what cocks smacking world and

1337
01:50:03,310 --> 01:50:09,790
What in what world is that right in? What are you?

1338
01:50:09,790 --> 01:50:14,440
Who even are you who do you think you are?

1339
01:50:14,440 --> 01:50:16,600
600,000

1340
01:50:16,600 --> 01:50:21,190
600,000 good god Oh

1341
01:50:21,190 --> 01:50:25,920
Lou alright, whatever I'm gonna make this guy I'm gonna make this guy we're gonna make two of these guys

1342
01:50:25,920 --> 01:50:31,450
I don't have enough money for it. I don't have the money how the hell am I gonna get more money?

1343
01:50:31,450 --> 01:50:39,400
More money, I've got money guys. I've got no money. I've got no money

1344
01:50:39,400 --> 01:50:44,590
I'm so poor if this egg fails to incubate, I'm

1345
01:50:44,590 --> 01:50:51,790
Just sunk. I'm sunk. I can't there's no way just I won't be able to do nothing

1346
01:50:51,790 --> 01:50:56,080
I'll be I'll be washed up. I guess I could make a you an

1347
01:50:56,080 --> 01:50:57,840
Or I could look up the ankles

1348
01:50:57,840 --> 01:51:00,700
I should've but I guess I should have been doing I should have been doing my

1349
01:51:00,700 --> 01:51:06,570
Contracts that would that would have been a smart thing to do Wow. Why haven't I been doing that? What about my missions?

1350
01:51:06,570 --> 01:51:11,130
Where are my missions? Whoa, all right. I don't know, you know, this is a bunch of baloney

1351
01:51:11,130 --> 01:51:15,930
Can I I can't even get another contract cuz I haven't been doing what I was supposed to be doing. I'm so stupid

1352
01:51:15,930 --> 01:51:21,790
I'm just some dumb. Why am I making one of these when I should have been making a one of the whole Wang's and

1353
01:51:21,790 --> 01:51:25,060
I could have gotten I could have gotten the money

1354
01:51:25,060 --> 01:51:28,930
But I didn't I've got Draco Rex here

1355
01:51:28,930 --> 01:51:35,230
You are gonna be much smaller than I thought you'd be you are fucking tiny

1356
01:51:35,230 --> 01:51:40,540
You're smaller than the me mousse in what

1357
01:51:40,540 --> 01:51:44,500
what why were you so expensive you're

1358
01:51:44,500 --> 01:51:46,840
You're not worth it. Oh

1359
01:51:46,840 --> 01:51:51,040
Don't roar. You're tiny I am

1360
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:55,030
Incredibly the Dragon King the Dracorex

1361
01:51:55,030 --> 01:52:05,080
Sounds so intimidating, but it's just a plant-eater. However, just in case they do rule the earth again

1362
01:52:05,080 --> 01:52:07,660
I'm gonna call you

1363
01:52:07,660 --> 01:52:13,020
You're gonna be Malfoy, and I know that you would rather have more social right now, but to be perfectly honest

1364
01:52:13,020 --> 01:52:15,840
I just can't afford making another one of you. Okay, fine

1365
01:52:15,840 --> 01:52:18,190
I'll make another one of you good god

1366
01:52:18,190 --> 01:52:20,890
But I need to make I need to make a who hang'd

1367
01:52:20,890 --> 01:52:25,570
Wayne might not work because I don't have enough money to risk two Wang's I

1368
01:52:25,570 --> 01:52:30,000
Just can't afford the wings. I can't even afford to go on an expedition

1369
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:31,120
I

1370
01:52:31,120 --> 01:52:37,980
Got sell my fossils or something Oh avian fossils. Okay sell that that's good. Let's sell this cuz I'm not gonna make up

1371
01:52:37,980 --> 01:52:41,320
I'm not gonna make up a loss or after I might as well not have gotten those

1372
01:52:41,320 --> 01:52:47,590
All right. Let's send him on an expedition. We're gonna eye buys get out of there. Where's the Hwang?

1373
01:52:47,590 --> 01:52:51,040
Give me here the hole Aang Chung King

1374
01:52:51,040 --> 01:52:58,470

1375
01:52:58,470 --> 01:53:03,370
You're gonna you're gonna get a friend here. You're gonna get a friend over to queue up

1376
01:53:03,370 --> 01:53:09,310
Let's queue up a Wang, but we got to give this Hawaii modified genome because it needs the intensive repair

1377
01:53:09,310 --> 01:53:16,690
So let's hang it up with some repair aggressive instincts. Here we go. This is what it needed, right? All right. We got the Hwang

1378
01:53:16,690 --> 01:53:23,050
Let's cook up a Hawaiian you you're gonna be Ron mother fuckin

1379
01:53:23,050 --> 01:53:25,600

Motherfucking Weasley and I think that's only a Brophy we got those in order

1382
01:53:39,239 --> 01:53:46,900
The expedition should be coming back. We've got 71 thousand dollars. Somehow. We keep running outta money, you know don't know why

1383
01:53:46,900 --> 01:53:49,360
It just keep happening

1384
01:53:49,360 --> 01:53:53,470
All right, you get get ready to go right back out motherfucker

1385
01:53:53,470 --> 01:53:59,230
Yeah that struthiomimus because we probably need to perfect it even more don't we?

1386
01:53:59,230 --> 01:54:03,400
Okay, what's this? Oh hell yes, silver sell that. Oh

1387
01:54:03,400 --> 01:54:05,350

01:54:05,350 --> 01:54:07,270
Hell yeah. Oh

Oh good old low-quality Wang. All right

1390
01:54:11,590 --> 01:54:17,290
We're gonna call you. All right, what should we call Wang here? Oh, you are an ugly

1391
01:54:17,290 --> 01:54:23,080
You're an ugly guy. Oh, you got kind of a punk rock thing going on. Oh

1392
01:54:23,080 --> 01:54:30,310
Okay. All right. Well no need for a little skip like that. Okay Wang

1393
01:54:30,310 --> 01:54:31,600
It took

1394
01:54:31,600 --> 01:54:38,190
It took a bit of doing I will admit it took a bit of doing Oh, all right, you're gonna wank. Hai. Yang

1395
01:54:38,190 --> 01:54:40,060
You're gonna be called

1396
01:54:40,060 --> 01:54:41,410
mister

1397
01:54:41,410 --> 01:54:42,580
mister

1398
01:54:42,580 --> 01:54:45,910
Pannu pea noodle Oh

1399
01:54:45,910 --> 01:54:47,800
Mr. Pea noodle. Ooh

1400
01:54:47,800 --> 01:54:52,870
Okay, everybody say hi to mr. Pea noodle. Ooh

1401
01:54:52,870 --> 01:54:55,500
My first instinct was just mr. Penis

1402
01:54:55,500 --> 01:54:56,010
All right

1403
01:54:56,010 --> 01:55:01,480
We need to make another one of those even though it's probably gonna fail because the social is gonna get real down on it

1404
01:55:01,480 --> 01:55:09,700
So we're gonna incubate another one of these bad boys, but I know it's gonna fail Oh incoming storm. Well, that's probably

1405
01:55:09,700 --> 01:55:14,770
That's probably not good shelter coverage 92%

1406
01:55:14,770 --> 01:55:21,100
That's probably not good can we make another

1407
01:55:21,100 --> 01:55:28,450
50 I don't want to spend the money. I look look look it may only cover 93% 92% but to be honest

1408
01:55:28,450 --> 01:55:30,790
Let's open the shelter

1409
01:55:30,790 --> 01:55:37,840
Boy, boy, look that 8% How much could those lawsuits actually cost me? I just can't afford the money

1410
01:55:37,840 --> 01:55:41,110
You might want to turn around there

1411
01:55:41,110 --> 01:55:42,940
start running

1412
01:55:42,940 --> 01:55:49,890
Hmm. Oh, wait a minute. That's that's less than good. Let's get the repair team going. Can we add a task?

1413
01:55:49,890 --> 01:55:56,320
Can you just repair why it's already on 4 it's just a little rain. How did it look it on fire here mother?

1414
01:55:56,320 --> 01:55:59,739
Ok, we need an Clea sore. We need a ankle yasur

1415
01:55:59,739 --> 01:56:07,780
Ankle Yasur. There we go. Oh boy. That's not good. Where's my repair team? Where'd they go you ok? I had a task

1416
01:56:07,780 --> 01:56:10,720
Repair that. All right

1417
01:56:10,720 --> 01:56:12,400
Huh? What's

1418
01:56:12,400 --> 01:56:19,440
The right environment if they're going to thrive, ah, shut up. No one cares what you're thinking what happened. Am I there it is?

1419
01:56:19,440 --> 01:56:25,410
Yeah, we're getting there. We're getting there. Mommy. What's wrong with mommy? Oh, it's comforts down. It's raining

1420
01:56:25,410 --> 01:56:31,980
Do you expect me to actually do anything about the rain? I can't exactly stop that and it's cleared up. Okay?

1421
01:56:31,980 --> 01:56:38,080
All right, that's all over clothes all good order and release

1422
01:56:38,080 --> 01:56:46,990
Okay, so there was mr. P no Lulu this one's gonna be

1425
01:56:58,080 --> 01:57:05,020
Okay, wait, my hilarious name has to wait where you add tasks go fit. Yep, that's important

1431
01:57:32,770 --> 01:57:35,320
The answer is no

1432
01:57:35,320 --> 01:57:37,360

1434
01:57:38,920 --> 01:57:41,950
You've had a friend. Why can't you just cooperate?

1435

Wait, can I just drive this and what happens if I uh dart rifle? Okay, here we go

1441
01:58:14,920 --> 01:58:21,820
While dinosaur mr. P and Lulu ain't too happy see the thing is he's gonna be happy now I

1442
01:58:21,820 --> 01:58:27,990

1447
01:58:42,340 --> 01:58:43,390

1448
01:58:43,390 --> 01:58:46,440
Crumpled in a rag doll EEP. Ah, here we go

1449
01:58:46,440 --> 01:58:53,610
Okay, get this guy move him to back in the spot and now everything's fine

1450
01:58:53,610 --> 01:58:59,950
Give me your money. Okay is everybody else happy here. You're all happy. Yeah, you're all happy. You're all happy

1451
01:58:59,950 --> 01:59:07,300
Where's uh, where's the other one? Okay. So as I was saying as I was saying Oh Forrest wait,

1452
01:59:07,300 --> 01:59:11,400
All these neat Forrest. Okay, let's we don't need Forrest wire then

1453
01:59:11,400 --> 01:59:18,310
Why are you standing if you don't like Forrest then? Why are you standing in the forest? That's your own fault?

1454
01:59:18,310 --> 01:59:24,240
That your own stupid fault just move. It's not my fault. The you're standing in the forest

1455
01:59:24,240 --> 01:59:32,440
Oh, is it not enough Forrest? Oh, is it not enough? I'm very confused. Do you want more for I can make more is

1456
01:59:32,440 --> 01:59:39,940
That what you wanted, I'm assuming this is what you wanted, right?

1457
01:59:39,940 --> 01:59:45,280
Okay, that's what I like about me, okay, all right now that we got that taken care of time for your name

1458
01:59:45,280 --> 01:59:46,990
missus

1459
01:59:46,990 --> 01:59:58,450
vagine' noodle

1460
01:59:58,450 --> 02:00:05,910
And is he still taking a little nap is he still taking a nap in here it's pretty dense forest in there. Mr

1461
02:00:05,910 --> 02:00:08,110
Payne a little and

1462
02:00:08,110 --> 02:00:09,280
missus

1463
02:00:09,280 --> 02:00:12,850
vaginal

1464
02:00:12,850 --> 02:00:20,740
No relation no relation. I'm pretty happy with myself. I'm pretty

1465
02:00:20,740 --> 02:00:27,160
Something horrible has happened. I don't even have a research station. How do I get a research station? I don't even remember

1466
02:00:27,160 --> 02:00:29,170
mister for Janu Lou

1467
02:00:29,170 --> 02:00:35,260
Mr. Peanut lo this disease is spreading faster than we can contain it. Oh no. Oh

1468
02:00:35,260 --> 02:00:42,160
God, it's a horrible horrible STD. Those those two have been having raucous

1469
02:00:42,160 --> 02:00:45,940
raucous raucous dinosaur sex and it is just getting

1470
02:00:45,940 --> 02:00:53,340
Absolutely out of hand. Yeah, they are probably not doing very good. Okay, let's send you out again. We're not doing good here

1471
02:00:53,340 --> 02:00:56,050
Oh, you're not doing good go over there. Let's

1472
02:00:56,050 --> 02:01:02,710
Research these and extract. Okay, that should suffice for the the other requirement that we have over there

1473
02:01:02,710 --> 02:01:09,100
Which is good and then eventually we're gonna get mister peeny lulu and mrs. Vaginal. Ooh up and running

1474
02:01:09,100 --> 02:01:12,520
But for right now, it's just going to be a bit of a problem

1475
02:01:12,520 --> 02:01:16,210
Excuse you I did not need you pop it in front of my face like this

1476
02:01:16,210 --> 02:01:19,890
We'll get to it in a second. They're probably gonna die there. They're probably gonna die

1477
02:01:19,890 --> 02:01:25,450
There's literally no way that I'm gonna be able to get this built and the research done in enough time to be able to save

1478
02:01:25,450 --> 02:01:27,730
Them. Alright, we're gonna try

1479
02:01:27,730 --> 02:01:31,990
All right medical treatment. Let's get four is

1480
02:01:31,990 --> 02:01:34,000
this what we're

1481
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,400
Okay. What do you have Bracken?

1482
02:01:36,400 --> 02:01:44,380
Bracken poisoning Bracken, there we go. Bracken poisoning. That doesn't make any sense. All right, we're gonna get the other we're gonna get these guys

1483
02:01:44,380 --> 02:01:49,420
Where is my ranger? Where are my Rangers? Oh, you're over here. Duh. I wasn't even in the right place

1484
02:01:49,420 --> 02:01:53,380
okay, you're gonna number one repair that and

1485
02:01:53,380 --> 02:01:57,490
Then we're gonna once you do that. I'm going to take you over

1486
02:01:57,490 --> 02:02:02,700
We're gonna go and we're gonna shoot some. Dinos. We're gonna shoot them good then we should take some pictures, too

1487
02:02:02,700 --> 02:02:08,740
I bet people would pay a lot of money for a sick dino. Okay, so we're gonna get the dart gun out. Okay you

1488
02:02:08,740 --> 02:02:10,600
blink

1489
02:02:10,600 --> 02:02:18,280
Medication now Rhys. Oh, well, I'm boosting your health though. Yeah. There we go

1490
02:02:18,280 --> 02:02:25,710
He's la Muerta, oh ho got you right in your butt. Oh ho come back here Hey look look look look Oh gotcha

1491
02:02:25,710 --> 02:02:32,530
Oh, he's a fast one. He's a well you shouldn't have stopped. Gotcha. All right, cool. Oh

1492
02:02:32,530 --> 02:02:36,490
I love this mitigation delivery system Oh, gotcha

1493
02:02:36,490 --> 02:02:38,050
Okay. All right

1494
02:02:38,050 --> 02:02:45,100
There's no sources of bracken poisoning remain in the bargain. Okay building available. What do we got?

1495
02:02:45,100 --> 02:02:48,990
I'd strongly suggest you consider taking this contract

1496
02:02:48,990 --> 02:02:57,500
I strongly suggest you take consideration of this France the

1497
02:02:57,500 --> 02:03:03,050
Ability, okay. We'll do that one. All right, so far so good. We need a dinosaur rating of

1498
02:03:03,050 --> 02:03:09,110
1.0. Where is our dinosaur rating anyway island rating dinosaur rating poor variety great welfare

1499
02:03:09,110 --> 02:03:11,870
Okay, that's nice facility rating is good

1500
02:03:11,870 --> 02:03:17,770
Responsible management of our animals is key as is creating a safe environment for our visitors

1501
02:03:17,770 --> 02:03:22,910
Hey, I don't know about that second one that second one probably isn't as good as you think it is

1502
02:03:22,910 --> 02:03:29,150
All right, you know what? I guess I should get some variety I guess going which seems stupid

1503
02:03:29,150 --> 02:03:34,820
Seems really stupid, but whatever. Maybe I should get some big boys. Maybe I should get some big boys

1504
02:03:34,820 --> 02:03:39,290
Oh, yeah, let's get some big boys going. Let's get some big boys

1505
02:03:39,290 --> 02:03:43,160
I would have a better island rating if I just got more dinos

1506
02:03:43,160 --> 02:03:49,390
So I'm I'm assuming that these big boys are gonna help me get what I need to do. We can get another contract

1507
02:03:49,390 --> 02:03:52,100
So let's get another contract

1508
02:03:52,100 --> 02:03:55,700
Entertainment?

1509
02:03:55,700 --> 02:04:02,500
Perfect just no power for, no power outages for ten minutes. That sounds good. Okay. Oh, oh god, damn it

1510
02:04:02,500 --> 02:04:05,870
Oh, I didn't finish my research. Oooooh.

1511
02:04:05,870 --> 02:04:11,470
Did I know I did? Oh that's stupid. There was such a small chance of that. What a what a piece of poop

1512
02:04:11,470 --> 02:04:18,790
What a poop what a poop mouth! what a poop, poop face, which poop! they're gonna be made and that's fine

1513
02:04:18,790 --> 02:04:24,490
I think this place is probably getting a little too crowded for them, which is probably why they're having some issues

1514
02:04:24,490 --> 02:04:29,810
But...  once we get these other diners up and running we can get a carnivore area

1515
02:04:29,810 --> 02:04:32,780
So that we don't have to worry about any, any

1516
02:04:32,780 --> 02:04:39,039
Interference in between the two but I still want to create a fighting pit. I think that's super cool was too weak

1517
02:04:39,039 --> 02:04:44,210
You, you, mother- you, you. piece of

1518
02:04:44,210 --> 02:04:50,300
Shit you piece of shit too weak to serve I can't afford another one

1519
02:04:50,300 --> 02:04:53,870
That was two, that's two that's

1520
02:04:53,870 --> 02:04:57,080
$600,000 that just went down the drain

1521
02:04:57,080 --> 02:05:02,900
That's 600 do- . I don't wanna release one is gonna be lonely!!!

1522
02:05:02,900 --> 02:05:10,369
Th-th-the that's so much money! you just threw money I had money I don't have money because you're an asshole. All right, it's fine it's fine

1523
02:05:10,369 --> 02:05:13,670
It's fine. It's fine. I don't have enough money. I'll release the one of them

1524
02:05:13,670 --> 02:05:17,519
that'll probably get my rating up because everyone is gonna be like, oh

1525
02:05:17,519 --> 02:05:19,170
Wow.

1526
02:05:19,170 --> 02:05:29,180
Look at this guy. Oh, it's fine. It's all good. You're gonna be uh you're gonna be called poop

1527
02:05:29,180 --> 02:05:31,619
*Mark Laughing*

1528
02:05:31,619 --> 02:05:36,210
Everybody out of poooooooo I

1529
02:05:36,210 --> 02:05:50,879
Can't whatever I get upset, I just come up with the most childish name I could possible think of.

1530
02:05:50,879 --> 02:05:51,599
pooooooop

1531
02:05:51,599 --> 02:05:54,900
Dino bites. Oh

1532
02:05:54,900 --> 02:05:58,829
Sell for ooh, wait, what? Oh

1533
02:05:58,829 --> 02:06:03,030
We're not managing this?!  We'll get some staff in there

1534
02:06:03,030 --> 02:06:10,079
Management view we're gonna we're gonna sell lots of food. We're gonna sell lots of food. We're gonna sell it for

1535
02:06:10,079 --> 02:06:17,570
8 bucks because of the service that we got going Dino Dino bites Dino dish. We got Dino dish here!

1536
02:06:17,570 --> 02:06:22,760
Oh hell, I didn't know that you could micromanage it like this. I had no idea. Oh, those are the running causes are crazy

1537
02:06:22,760 --> 02:06:28,650
Ok, we don't need that many people. We need 3, 3 good people. That's what's gonna get us. Ok, we can sell

1538
02:06:28,650 --> 02:06:33,150
Barbasol! I don't know why? we're gonna sell that bad boy for...

I can't get my rating up because I don't have enough

1579
02:09:42,249 --> 02:09:48,219
Dinos if I just get this one, Dino, I'd get two contracts done. They'd be done

99% chance possible for success that is literally no chance

1591
02:11:01,360 --> 02:11:08,260
There is no chance. It's gonna fail this is absolutely 100% going to work

1592
02:11:08,260 --> 02:11:09,310

Squadala and with that we have got this place ready to go

1615
02:12:59,650 --> 02:13:07,090
We're gonna I think they're all like the ones that were there before ed and Nettie they're dead. So we need another trio

1616
02:13:07,090 --> 02:13:13,570
I'm gonna call buffle bubbles blossom and Buttercup. Got it. Okay. Oh

Shut up hurry up. We've got a line going

1618
02:13:16,900 --> 02:13:22,720
If it's all about you, then things are not gonna go well. Alright you are this is blossom

1619
02:13:22,720 --> 02:13:27,820
Everybody say hi to blossom and then bubbles is coming out there and then Buttercup will be

1620
02:13:27,820 --> 02:13:32,710
Buttercup, we'll be on the way right about no

1621
02:13:32,710 --> 02:13:37,240
Never mind, I don't have enough money. Are you gonna roar? You're gonna be done? How do I not?

1622
02:13:37,240 --> 02:13:41,700
How do I how is it? Oh, it's up. Wait, it's up. Wait. Give me my money

1623
02:13:41,700 --> 02:13:48,040
Give me my need to do it for ya. Okay. All right. This is butter this bobbles

1624
02:13:48,040 --> 02:13:51,300
theses bobbles these bobbles these blossom

1625
02:13:51,300 --> 02:13:57,040
I should have just gotten one of the carnivores because the carnivores are always higher rated than these goddamn assholes

1626
02:13:57,040 --> 02:13:59,710
Not like these not like the mimo muumuus

1627
02:13:59,710 --> 02:14:04,840
And piece of shit do nothing for me bunch of garbage

1628
02:14:04,840 --> 02:14:06,800
dinosaur rating it

1629
02:14:06,800 --> 02:14:07,440
I

1630
02:14:07,440 --> 02:14:12,809
think the reason that my other dinosaurs were so highly rated because they probably had a lot of combat infamy just from

1631
02:14:12,809 --> 02:14:20,270
Crunching all the gets so there's really nothing that nothing that I did. It's just they they were very vicious very vicious

1632
02:14:20,270 --> 02:14:22,980
okay, and then um

1633
02:14:22,980 --> 02:14:27,989
How am I not island raiding? I want my Island port capacity

1634
02:14:27,989 --> 02:14:32,969
What port capacity is it because I'm pricing them too high

1635
02:14:32,969 --> 02:14:38,960
Is that the problem is it because they're too expensive? Is that what it is? Oh, no one's there. Oh, okay

1636
02:14:38,960 --> 02:14:45,780
No one's buying it. Oh, whatever Oh screw me that no one's buying because it's so expensive

1637
02:14:45,780 --> 02:14:49,040
Fuck you. Alright, whatever. We're gonna make it twelve. That's it

1638
02:14:49,040 --> 02:14:53,270
Seems totally fair that it would be double the price of whatever it is

1639
02:14:53,270 --> 02:15:00,150
is that the reason my my Park has been going down is that the reason is that the reason is that the reason because I

1640
02:15:00,150 --> 02:15:06,780
Feel like that's really mean management view. I thought I told you the management view was fun. Oh

1641
02:15:06,780 --> 02:15:12,409
I saw that it just went back to none management view is fun

1642
02:15:12,409 --> 02:15:17,809
It goes back to none. How can you not know? It's fun, right?

1643
02:15:17,809 --> 02:15:25,290
That's Buttercup know our mission in raising. These animals is to provide an environment for them to thrive

1644
02:15:25,290 --> 02:15:30,449
Your habitat is too small for them. How do you know how do you know? It's too small?

1645
02:15:30,449 --> 02:15:32,840
How do you know it's too small? Are you sure it's too small?

1646
02:15:32,840 --> 02:15:37,050
Maybe you're too small you ever think about that you ever think that you're too small you didn't think about that?

1647
02:15:37,050 --> 02:15:39,079
Cuz you might be you might be too small

1648
02:15:39,079 --> 02:15:44,420
I could either build more fence or I could build a hotel and you know, it's when I'm gonna be going for stupid

1649
02:15:44,420 --> 02:15:51,260
Idiot our hotels going up. They're not they're not cooperating with me. They don't know. I am all about the fun

1650
02:15:51,260 --> 02:15:59,340
I'm all about the fun. This is a fun place full of fun people. We're having lots of fun. We're having lots of

1651
02:15:59,340 --> 02:16:04,920
fun

1652
02:16:04,920 --> 02:16:06,079
Good thank you

1653
02:16:06,079 --> 02:16:10,429
You're gonna give me money for putting down a hotel that just proves to me that it was the right idea all along

1654
02:16:10,429 --> 02:16:15,179
Alright, I'm gonna make a bigger habitat for these asshole

1655
02:16:15,179 --> 02:16:18,290
Pieces of shit we're gonna basically I'm gonna do this in two stages

1656
02:16:18,290 --> 02:16:22,250
I'm gonna build it out for okay, don't let this go to your head

1657
02:16:22,250 --> 02:16:29,180
But that was some very impressive work on that contract Wow. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much

1658
02:16:29,180 --> 02:16:31,110

02:16:31,110 --> 02:16:33,530
Suspected as much but I'm glad you said it

1660
02:16:33,530 --> 02:16:40,290
Anyway, I knew it was really really impressive work because it was really difficult. It was incredible. Oh

1661
02:16:40,290 --> 02:16:44,160
Shit, huh? All right. Well, let's

Okay, so far so good

1667
02:17:03,650 --> 02:17:07,830
I mean the Dinos probably ain't getting too comfortable about it, but I

Think they'll be all right seems to be clearing up all good. All good. Okay. All right

1677
02:18:03,090 --> 02:18:10,560
Okay, all right cool I deserve it I do deserve that that's that's on to present I deserve that one other person absolutely do

1678
02:18:10,560 --> 02:18:11,610
but

1679
02:18:11,610 --> 02:18:15,620
Also, I got a bunch of stuff here bird eggs. That doesn't help anybody. Are they sure

1680
02:18:15,620 --> 02:18:22,830
That's a bird egg the pretty sure that's not like, you know unimportant egg 202. Oh hell. Yeah. I'm making so much money

1681
02:18:22,830 --> 02:18:32,059
Okay, this is going really really really good. Really really good. I probably need to make another shelter at some point

1682
02:18:32,059 --> 02:18:36,000
Toy shop that sounds fun. Oh, that sounds

1683
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:39,479
Super fun. That's good. Are they wearing hats? Oh

1684
02:18:39,479 --> 02:18:46,949
That's for a second. Okay, bubbles blossom wait wasn't Buttercup supposed to pop out and didn't did Buttercup get scooted out of there

1685
02:18:46,949 --> 02:18:54,179
But butter buttercup didn't have a buttercup. Oh there you are. Buttercup. There you are. There you go. Okay. All right. We got that

1686
02:18:54,179 --> 02:18:55,590
That's good

1687
02:18:55,590 --> 02:19:01,729
That's good is looking good. That's looking good. We are doing really really good. All right, so what's next to do?

1688
02:19:01,729 --> 02:19:03,630
What would be next to do?

1689
02:19:03,630 --> 02:19:09,329
They said that the transportation in this place ain't too good, but I don't exactly know how to build more monorail

1690
02:19:09,329 --> 02:19:14,550
How would I build more monorail if I were just to be perfectly honest about it?

1691
02:19:14,550 --> 02:19:19,619
Cuz honestly, I don't know feeder needs resupply. Well, that seems important. Ooh, we need more power

1692
02:19:19,619 --> 02:19:26,429
I think I can still put modules into the new one over here. Yeah, I probably can add

1693
02:19:26,429 --> 02:19:32,250
Output. Okay, that's a little bit more but not that much

1694
02:19:32,250 --> 02:19:36,029
It'll keep us it'll keep us good for the time being until I can get more stuff

1695
02:19:36,029 --> 02:19:41,849
We could build a new zone and actually get some carnivores up in here, which is what I want to do

1696
02:19:41,849 --> 02:19:47,569
We could probably do it over here in carnivore land. Okay, let's build let's do exactly that

1697
02:19:47,569 --> 02:19:52,800
Let's cuz we oh, look how much space we're gonna make this all oh

1698
02:19:52,800 --> 02:19:54,960
Yeah. Oh

1699
02:19:54,960 --> 02:20:01,290
Yeah, okay, we're gonna make it carnivore land but it's gonna have like a there's also going to be a rapping

1700
02:20:01,290 --> 02:20:06,119
Observation road that's gonna have a bunch of observation decks. But before we do that I need to

1701
02:20:06,119 --> 02:20:08,130
DeForest I need to absolutely

1702
02:20:08,130 --> 02:20:13,640
Destroy all of the beauty of this land and then I have to terraform it and it's it's really gonna be bad

1703
02:20:13,640 --> 02:20:20,100
So if you if you're just if you're a faint of heart just divert your eyes because it's going to be rough and tough

1704
02:20:20,100 --> 02:20:24,090
There's gonna be so much dense foliage in here. No one's gonna know what kind of

1705
02:20:24,090 --> 02:20:29,279
Dinosaurs are hiding up in here and the observation road is gonna be how long a coast because that sounds real cool

1706
02:20:29,279 --> 02:20:31,520
We've got so much money that it doesn't even matter

1707
02:20:31,520 --> 02:20:35,159
So we just take all this money and we're gonna we're gonna put it to some good use

1708
02:20:35,159 --> 02:20:39,000
Putin's real good use this is where the plateau is

1709
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:44,070
That's the plateau. We're gonna build a ride on the plateau

1710
02:20:44,070 --> 02:20:48,950
There we go. That's what I'm talking about. Plateau is right there. Cool. All right, cool

1711
02:20:48,950 --> 02:20:53,640
We got that my path is gonna connect with a nice curly boy

1712
02:20:53,640 --> 02:20:57,140
Right there and that the pass is gonna wrap around right there

1713
02:20:57,140 --> 02:21:04,470
And then the whole enclosure is gonna be wrapping around the whole dingdong damn thing. There we go

1714
02:21:04,470 --> 02:21:08,040
Okay, got it. Nailed it. Oh my god

1715
02:21:08,040 --> 02:21:10,350
This is some cool shit. I

1716
02:21:10,350 --> 02:21:15,590
Told you this is gonna be cool and you know, some of you didn't believe me some work you might be interested in

1717
02:21:15,590 --> 02:21:17,390
Oh, I might be interested in

1718
02:21:17,390 --> 02:21:18,080
Oh, you know

1719
02:21:18,080 --> 02:21:18,740
You know

1720
02:21:18,740 --> 02:21:21,900
I'm gonna be interesting in that I didn't make it electric fence

1721
02:21:21,900 --> 02:21:26,960
Because frankly that would have taken too much power and I just can't afford that I am very very cheap

1722
02:21:26,960 --> 02:21:33,900
I cannot afford pretty much anything anymore. But what I can do now is I'm gonna make a nice nice

1723
02:21:33,900 --> 02:21:41,420
Perilous mountain path that is going to skate right along the outskirts of what we have going on here

1724
02:21:41,420 --> 02:21:44,750
All right, and then that'll be the end of the line right there

1725
02:21:44,750 --> 02:21:50,240
Oh, yeah, and then we're gonna have a bunch of observation decks pretty much all over the place

1726
02:21:50,240 --> 02:21:53,850
You think you don't think all over the place? I'm thinking

1727
02:21:53,850 --> 02:21:58,740
Literally all over the place. Okay, we're gonna have one here here

1728
02:21:58,740 --> 02:22:00,930
Here, you know actually

1729
02:22:00,930 --> 02:22:06,590
Maybe we should have one right here. And then that'll be the only one right here. Yeah, let's just do that one

1730
02:22:06,590 --> 02:22:12,470
Let's list do that one. Let's let's not do that. Okay, cool. Got it. We've got tons of observation decks

1731
02:22:12,470 --> 02:22:15,000
We got over a million still

1732
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:19,680
Over a million smackers. We need more power out of this. So we're gonna need another

1733
02:22:19,680 --> 02:22:26,910
Substation bada bing go curvy boy. Okay cool. Then we need power substations. Cool

1734
02:22:26,910 --> 02:22:46,800
Then we need roads connecting all these

1735
02:22:46,800 --> 02:22:48,210
Thank you for noticing

1736
02:22:48,210 --> 02:22:51,110
Thank you for noticing. All right, we're gonna get the live bait

1737
02:22:51,110 --> 02:22:58,000
we're gonna have two live bait - live bait things we're gonna have two of them and then we're gonna have to

1738
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:05,190
Just carnivore feeders. Yeah, you know what? What's wrong with live bait, right? What's wrong man? Maybe we should good. Hmm. What's the difference?

1739
02:23:05,190 --> 02:23:09,301
What do we need less efficient it satisfies food and provides activity for the hunter

1740
02:23:09,301 --> 02:23:14,250
I mean, it seems like live bait would be better right wouldn't live bait be better overall

1741
02:23:14,250 --> 02:23:20,670
I think it would let's let's get another one like in the right here. I think so. Anyway god that was all my money

1742
02:23:20,670 --> 02:23:22,450
No, I forgot

1743
02:23:22,450 --> 02:23:27,280
They're so expensive. I forgot no expensive they were ah, no I

1744
02:23:27,280 --> 02:23:32,551
Have no money. Alright, let's see if we can get rid of this last one here. No, let's let's give it a refunded one

1745
02:23:32,551 --> 02:23:36,670
No, if it was only a refund of 25,000, I wouldn't have got it. I

1746
02:23:36,670 --> 02:23:40,960
Didn't mean to do that if it was only 20, I thought that was 200 bit

1747
02:23:40,960 --> 02:23:43,960
My money and now I don't have one more beat

1748
02:23:43,960 --> 02:23:52,840
Okay, it's fine. No everybody you you seem worried about

1749
02:23:52,840 --> 02:23:55,630
It on beat I

1750
02:23:55,630 --> 02:23:58,780
Don't even have dinosaurs. Why did I need bait?

1751
02:23:58,780 --> 02:24:10,210
Totally fine cuz these guys need water that's one thing that they definitely need. There we go

1752
02:24:10,210 --> 02:24:11,620
Horrible

1753
02:24:11,620 --> 02:24:20,170
Horrible, oh god, it looks as the worst thing I've ever seen in my life. Okay, whatever. It's fine. That looks nice. I

1754
02:24:20,170 --> 02:24:22,090
Kind of I guess

1755
02:24:22,090 --> 02:24:25,030
Boy, what goat? Why are you?

1756
02:24:25,030 --> 02:24:29,190
Jayant water dick it is if that doesn't even look remotely like a water dick in

1757
02:24:29,190 --> 02:24:35,410
What world is that a penis and what is wrong with your penis if that's what your penis looks like?

1758
02:24:35,410 --> 02:24:43,061
Maybe you should you see a doctor are you? Okay? Alright, we've got money. We need to make the

1759
02:24:43,061 --> 02:24:49,530
Reaction speed what does it even do? Oh, it makes him grow faster. Oh that's fascinating. I would do that

1760
02:24:49,530 --> 02:24:53,261
But I'm more worried about them being successful

1761
02:24:53,261 --> 02:24:59,051
Than anything such as that, so what can we afford? What can we afford to make we have a

1762
02:24:59,051 --> 02:25:02,650
thing for rapid metabolism

1763
02:25:02,650 --> 02:25:11,220
Ceratosaurus, and that's pretty good. So let's get a rapid metabolism going the Surat asaurus and then hopefully we'll be able to

1764
02:25:11,220 --> 02:25:17,630
I'm good. I mean we're not gonna have birdbrain. I would like birdbrain. Wait rapid. Oh, I don't even have rapid metabolism

1765
02:25:17,630 --> 02:25:23,550
Well, I got to go research that first. So let's do that. Ok genetic research rapid

1766
02:25:23,550 --> 02:25:25,050
metabolism

1767
02:25:25,050 --> 02:25:31,100
I don't have that. How do I get rapid metabolism in doing that is a bird thing

1768
02:25:31,100 --> 02:25:39,390
Oh, but I don't have the science

1769
02:25:39,390 --> 02:25:45,600
Hey doctor you want to give me a

1770
02:25:45,600 --> 02:25:51,050
I can help you as well. You mean just keeping a large number of guests in here?

1771
02:25:51,050 --> 02:25:56,970
Is that so really all your so your plan the your master plan here? We're gonna get

1772
02:25:56,970 --> 02:26:04,200
Some Cerreta sores, they may not have everything that we need but getting one of those bad boys in here

1773
02:26:04,200 --> 02:26:14,220
That is going to be bananas

1774
02:26:14,220 --> 02:26:20,279
Million that's a lot. No, how do I even know how many guests I have in the park at any time? Oh

1775
02:26:20,279 --> 02:26:22,100
I'm close. I'm not there yet

1776
02:26:22,100 --> 02:26:27,170
But I am close I could probably get there if I get another I get another like hotel or something

1777
02:26:27,170 --> 02:26:29,750
But I don't want to spend money on the hotel when I could get two

1778
02:26:29,750 --> 02:26:34,920
So I saw that's gonna get another one. Do I have enough money for another one I do

1779
02:26:34,920 --> 02:26:38,700
But I want to wait on it, but I want to get it now. I'm gonna get two now

1780
02:26:38,700 --> 02:26:43,590
Okay. So those are being built those will give me more guests. Those will give me more guests

1781
02:26:43,590 --> 02:26:50,880
Oh-oh, I'm close to that - oh, I'll get a mission when I get a mission. I'll get a million dollars

1782
02:26:50,880 --> 02:26:56,850
mmm, sabotage wait Sabbat

1783
02:26:56,850 --> 02:27:03,400
Wait wait

1784
02:27:03,400 --> 02:27:07,360
Bacon sabotage

1785
02:27:07,360 --> 02:27:10,780
Why would they do that why

1786
02:27:10,780 --> 02:27:16,360
Would they why why would they do that in what world?

1787
02:27:16,360 --> 02:27:24,730
Why would they do that? What would benefit it's a dinosaur park?

1788
02:27:24,730 --> 02:27:26,801
What why why

1789
02:27:26,801 --> 02:27:33,070
Why he okay. All right, Oh big boy time. All right big boy time. We're gonna release this do new. Oh,

1790
02:27:33,070 --> 02:27:37,121
Yeah, finally time for a big beastie boy. Oh

1791
02:27:37,121 --> 02:27:46,661
Yeah. Oh look at em. Oh, that's a big boy

1792
02:27:46,661 --> 02:27:49,150
You know you didn't have to prove anything

1793
02:27:49,150 --> 02:27:52,331
But the way you took charge left an impression

1794
02:27:52,331 --> 02:27:56,381
Good work this one this one right?

1795
02:27:56,381 --> 02:27:59,381
There a person to do this job and do it. Well

1796
02:27:59,381 --> 02:28:05,461
The Security Division is rewarding you because on isla murder. You are clearly that person. Thank you

1797
02:28:05,461 --> 02:28:13,391
I think okay. I'm gonna call this one's uh

1798
02:28:13,391 --> 02:28:16,061
Well that fits into your name just right this is cuddles

1799
02:28:16,061 --> 02:28:19,381
He really likes to call you, but he can't get you with your arms

1800
02:28:19,381 --> 02:28:22,381
So he's gotta like he's got a cuddle you on his insides

1801
02:28:22,381 --> 02:28:27,311
He's gonna he gives you a big hug all the way through his body

1802
02:28:27,311 --> 02:28:31,181
Gives you a big hug

1803
02:28:31,181 --> 02:28:35,171
Or sniffs Norv us no

1804
02:28:35,171 --> 02:28:44,230
All right, this one's uh, this one's are probably ready for a crunch and do but this this is this is

1805
02:28:44,230 --> 02:28:49,331
snuggles that snuggles that's cuddles

1806
02:28:49,331 --> 02:28:54,190
But I put so much work into this one

1807
02:28:54,190 --> 02:29:00,971
Failed enterprise

1808
02:29:00,971 --> 02:29:07,631
By you this place sounds perfect for you Ysleta can yo Oh,

1809
02:29:07,631 --> 02:29:15,100
Failed enterprise save this island from financial ruin the moss the failed infrastructure and plan out your own path to success. We're famous

1810
02:29:15,100 --> 02:29:18,459
Star dinosaurs like the transverse Rex to bring in record guest numbers

1811
02:29:18,459 --> 02:29:26,079
Gyro Sears bring your guests closer to the dinosaur with new visibility tools like the gyrosphere

1812
02:29:26,079 --> 02:29:28,810
I

1813
02:29:28,810 --> 02:29:32,109
But I just you know, I just kind of like

1814
02:29:32,109 --> 02:29:38,339
Kind of like got this one up and running. I was really interested in snuggles and cuddles over here

1815
02:29:38,339 --> 02:29:43,180
Oh here comes a crunching here comes the crunch Oh

1816
02:29:43,180 --> 02:29:46,089
gonna give you a nice cuddle Oh

1817
02:29:46,089 --> 02:29:50,890
Perfect. Oh not enough Forrest. Well, sorry. That's not my fault. That's your fault

1818
02:29:50,890 --> 02:29:53,850
That's your fault for not being in the forest enough

1819
02:29:53,850 --> 02:29:56,789
You got to give people like a view so, you know

1820
02:29:56,789 --> 02:30:01,899
The people need to be able to see so I got that and this is looking good

1821
02:30:01,899 --> 02:30:05,289
So should I go over to the new island?

1822
02:30:05,289 --> 02:30:09,869
Hum diddly hum diddly, hoho. I guess I could just get like more research here

1823
02:30:09,869 --> 02:30:18,279
I kind of like, you know would get research

1824
02:30:18,279 --> 02:30:21,669
Oh, well, let's get out of this island we gotta go

1825
02:30:21,669 --> 02:30:26,189
How do we go? How do we go to another? How do we get out here? Can we go to another island?

1826
02:30:26,189 --> 02:30:34,510
How do we get out of here? Ah?

1827
02:30:34,510 --> 02:30:36,010
Perfect

1828
02:30:36,010 --> 02:30:39,430
Okay. Alright wait, let me what was the UM?

1829
02:30:39,430 --> 02:30:45,459
Wait, what was it? What was the what was the special reward? Because I said there was a special reward for getting something done

1830
02:30:45,459 --> 02:30:48,939
here cuz it said there was like if it said there was um

1831
02:30:48,939 --> 02:30:52,569
It said there was rewards like you could get dig team Bravo

1832
02:30:52,569 --> 02:30:54,600
Which I'm assuming means another dig team

1833
02:30:54,600 --> 02:30:59,770
If I get a perfect five-star Island rating, which would be nice, but I don't think I'm gonna get there

1834
02:30:59,770 --> 02:31:11,350
Let's go over to the new place. Let's see what's going on here. Let's see you how how bad available cash negative nine Oh,

1835
02:31:11,350 --> 02:31:19,720
People's wants a monorail

1836
02:31:19,720 --> 02:31:25,949
Are you want a cono and there's a disease here? I don't I don't want that

1837
02:31:25,949 --> 02:31:32,000
I'm gonna go to I'm gonna Island to cono and build a monorail over there. I'll build a monorail

1838
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:36,830
I want to go being dead. That's what I know. That's what I love. So I'm gonna go do that

1839
02:31:36,830 --> 02:31:45,750
Oh, oh, it's beautiful near here

1840
02:31:45,750 --> 02:31:49,471
Spared no expense as Hammond would say a

1841
02:31:49,471 --> 02:31:57,511
Biological preserve, you know, you may have heard about it at least the stuff that wasn't classified. Oh

1842
02:31:57,511 --> 02:32:04,891
This is one of your predecessors was in charge of this island

1843
02:32:04,891 --> 02:32:09,120
But here's your opportunity to succeed where they failed

1844
02:32:09,120 --> 02:32:18,150
You'll need to carefully consider how to make money if you want to turn this into a profitable endeavor and you do trust me

1845
02:32:18,150 --> 02:32:23,400
Okay, oh this is the island this is though the one from

1846
02:32:23,400 --> 02:32:25,620
This is the one from the movie

1847
02:32:25,620 --> 02:32:31,431
This is the movie Island. It's already got a monorail. I'm telling you. It's pretty good

1848
02:32:31,431 --> 02:32:34,860
I'm gonna demolish it and get some money

1849
02:32:34,860 --> 02:32:41,570
Give me then money. So that monorail is gone. We didn't need it. Anyway, what a bunch of garbage. Anyway, am I right people?

1850
02:32:41,570 --> 02:32:43,801
I don't know. What what is this?

1851
02:32:43,801 --> 02:32:56,880
Innovation Center

1852
02:32:56,880 --> 02:33:00,210
Okay, all right

1853
02:33:00,210 --> 02:33:06,301
Cool well, I mean that it's cool to have an Innovation Center I guess but also we have no money

1854
02:33:06,301 --> 02:33:09,841
So I think I gotta get rid of

1855
02:33:09,841 --> 02:33:14,670
Yassem million Oh a milli. Milli. I'm gonna get a

1856
02:33:14,670 --> 02:33:21,750
Millimeter though. I like all this this looks cool. It's got a bunker. It's got whatever that is. Oh, it's an enclosure for

1857
02:33:21,750 --> 02:33:29,091
Something and then yeah, there's a little Dino area here just to fur baby dinos, which is probably what we're gonna start with

1858
02:33:29,091 --> 02:33:34,130
Right, or maybe I should demolish these anyway, it looks like there's redundant here

1859
02:33:34,130 --> 02:33:35,900
I don't think we need all of it

1860
02:33:35,900 --> 02:33:40,701
But I kind of want all of it because that's kind of cool and I want it and so I'm keeping it

1861
02:33:40,701 --> 02:33:45,811
I'm keeping it and I want it and that's all there is to it. I'm gonna make this area

1862
02:33:45,811 --> 02:33:46,831
bigger

1863
02:33:46,831 --> 02:33:51,171
There's gonna be bigger. Yeah, I know path not connected, but that's because I'm gonna redo the path

1864
02:33:51,171 --> 02:33:57,871
This path was done stupidly and it's for dumbs. But I am NOT a dumb. I am smart and I am NOT dumb

1865
02:33:57,871 --> 02:34:03,171
So we're gonna make this real good. Then I will get a monorail. I will I promise

1866
02:34:03,171 --> 02:34:08,931
Oh, I'll get a monorail wink wonk I'll get oh, yeah, you can count on me for a monorail

1867
02:34:08,931 --> 02:34:13,381
You know than the one I say I'm gonna get a monorail, you know, I mean business

1868
02:34:13,381 --> 02:34:19,471
Got it nailed it. All right cool. So that is leaves us with very little money

1869
02:34:19,471 --> 02:34:24,271
Yet. Can I get a loan? Can I get a loan? Can I get ha?

1870
02:34:24,271 --> 02:34:31,440
Oh, yeah, this needs a connect power. Okay, so that's connected. We have power. I think this one needs a substation

1871
02:34:31,440 --> 02:34:33,361
all right, so we're

1872
02:34:33,361 --> 02:34:39,051
70,000 that's not enough to get literally anything arcade. Oh, but I want on arcade. That's I'm so cool

1873
02:34:39,051 --> 02:34:44,190
Oh toy shop fast food the bar fossils own they sound so cool

1874
02:34:44,190 --> 02:34:48,451
Don't sound so great. Don't sound great. Why can't I keep those?

1875
02:34:48,451 --> 02:34:55,311
I'm losing money real fast. Okay, we're losing money. What is what is the problem here? What's the problem? What's going on?

1876
02:34:55,311 --> 02:35:01,730
Why Zahra read something or other? Why? Why read what? What's the dealio? What what's the deal? What's the dealio?

1877
02:35:01,730 --> 02:35:03,841
are we not oopen are we uh,

1878
02:35:03,841 --> 02:35:08,211
What's the dealio? What whoa, why are there no people here. There should be people here

1879
02:35:08,211 --> 02:35:13,131
I don't know why there's no people here probably because we got no dinos. Okay, we're gonna get rid of the fossils own

1880
02:35:13,131 --> 02:35:17,271
I don't want to do that. Oh god the bar. No, I can't drink anyway, so I guess it's okay

1881
02:35:17,271 --> 02:35:23,031
All right. We need to pick dinos. Now now now we're gonna start off with the cheapos. We're gonna start off with the cheapos

1882
02:35:23,031 --> 02:35:27,151
We're gonna modify the shit out of them. They're gonna be so modified

1883
02:35:27,151 --> 02:35:31,911
So we're gonna get a couple these boys and then suddenly baby. We got a stew going

1884
02:35:31,911 --> 02:35:41,491
I think we just did this by the skin of our tit eat it tits. Okay. We need to feed them

1885
02:35:41,491 --> 02:35:45,571
Feed them I did not think about

1886
02:35:45,571 --> 02:35:52,971
Feeding them probably. Okay. Get out there. All right me mow. Ma mow ma. Mow me me. Mama mama, probably it's probably fine

1887
02:35:52,971 --> 02:35:56,930
I'm not worried about. Okay, go go go. We got to go. We got to go. Come on

1888
02:35:56,930 --> 02:36:01,880
We got to make more gotta make more get out there entertain people. Just get out there

1889
02:36:01,880 --> 02:36:07,489
We got to get people in we got to get people. Oh, yeah, here they come. Oh, they're ready. Oh you're ready

1890
02:36:07,489 --> 02:36:12,920
Why is this still problem? What is the problem? What is why is something a problem here?

1891
02:36:12,920 --> 02:36:18,330
We've got to die knows which means that the game is on

1892
02:36:18,330 --> 02:36:21,560
Any minute now people are gonna come flooding through those doors

1893
02:36:21,560 --> 02:36:26,720
Oh people are flooding through those doors Oh, give me a gimme gimme contracts

1894
02:36:26,720 --> 02:36:35,040
Gimme, no get give gimme contracts. I need contract like right now. Mmm. Anarchie. Oh no norm of the Louis's

1895
02:36:35,040 --> 02:36:40,189
Reaction speed do I even have reaction speed an RKO thermos? I don't I can't even research

1896
02:36:40,189 --> 02:36:45,029
We asking speed because I don't have that. Maybe I gotta go to another park to be able to research

1897
02:36:45,029 --> 02:36:49,710
That makes a lot of sense. Do they get make money when I'm not there. That would be pretty cool

1898
02:36:49,710 --> 02:36:56,699
That'd be pretty pretty tight. They might not do that. They might absolutely not do that

1899
02:36:56,699 --> 02:37:01,290
Hmm problem also, I don't even know if I have the ability to get an RKO

1900
02:37:01,290 --> 02:37:06,390
The minimus mytha - oh, here's the people. There's the people

1901
02:37:06,390 --> 02:37:13,350
Look at my eye. I've got 5 out of 5 facility rating. Oh

1902
02:37:13,350 --> 02:37:16,859
Yeah

1903
02:37:16,859 --> 02:37:22,409
These guys these guys don't do shit for me so I got to get a big I got to get a big I

1904
02:37:22,409 --> 02:37:26,090
Can't afford any big not but can't afford any big ok

1905
02:37:26,090 --> 02:37:30,680
I think that's I think that's pretty much everything there is to it and I still don't know why this is here feeders

1906
02:37:30,680 --> 02:37:37,159
Ah, yeah 4 died. Can I afford it? Yes, I can. Okay, I can afford one fede. There we go

1907
02:37:37,159 --> 02:37:40,439
I have no ranger station, but I've got one fede boy

1908
02:37:40,439 --> 02:37:44,460
Okay, that is gonna do it for now

1909
02:37:44,460 --> 02:37:47,159
Let's save this as one

1910
02:37:47,159 --> 02:37:53,970
Fede boy that is all the time I have for this game. Thank you guys so much for watching

1911
02:37:53,970 --> 02:37:57,250
Have a good night. And as always

1912
02:37:57,250 --> 02:38:21,000
In the next video, bye-bye
