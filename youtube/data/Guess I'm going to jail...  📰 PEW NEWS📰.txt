1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,680

13
00:00:41,265 --> 00:00:44,095
now let's get into the first news, guys

14
00:00:44,095 --> 00:00:46,695
Nicole Arbour, the smug face, son of a...

15
00:00:46,695 --> 00:00:49,625
..ball, has returned to YouTube with another one of her

16
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:52,475
wonderful comedy sketches. Nicole of course

17
00:00:52,475 --> 00:00:55,245
which last year published a very famous

18
00:00:55,245 --> 00:00:58,185
video, dear fat people, where she basically

19
00:00:58,185 --> 00:01:00,160
conveyed the message that

20
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,000
it's your own fault ok you're just being

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,005
really lazy and

22
00:01:05,005 --> 00:01:07,735
now she made a video in the same sort of fashion but

23
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:10,495
about depression, now I don't personally give

24
00:01:10,495 --> 00:01:13,455
my own opinions here on Pew News, I am bias

25
00:01:13,455 --> 00:01:16,205
unbiased, I keep getting it wrong hahahaha

26
00:01:16,205 --> 00:01:19,060
I am completely unbiased but I

27
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,705
Think this is great and I for one can't wait for

28
00:01:21,705 --> 00:01:24,640
the video, dear disabled people, uhh

29
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,555
dear disabled people It's all in your head

30
00:01:27,555 --> 00:01:29,445
hahahahhahaha

31
00:01:29,445 --> 00:01:32,865
look you just have to stand up, I can do it

32
00:01:32,865 --> 00:01:35,335
so  can you, it's all in your head

33
00:01:35,335 --> 00:01:38,275
stupid. She uploaded the video saying why

34
00:01:38,275 --> 00:01:40,365
depression is all in your head

35
00:01:40,365 --> 00:01:43,545
Nicole: only one person can get you out of depression, and that is you, it's all in your head

36
00:01:43,545 --> 00:01:46,725
it's all in your head, literally. You idiot it's genetics haha

37
00:01:46,725 --> 00:01:49,715
no. Now we are getting a little bit into YouTube gossip

38
00:01:49,715 --> 00:01:51,975
territory right now, but I feel like I have to

39
00:01:51,975 --> 00:01:54,775
give you enough context because that's very important

40
00:01:54,775 --> 00:01:58,095
so basically right, Nicole Arbour used to date the

41
00:01:58,095 --> 00:02:00,965
bald top 10 guy on YouTube

42
00:02:00,965 --> 00:02:04,005
His name was Matthew Santoro I think and they used to be together

43
00:02:04,005 --> 00:02:06,975
and everyone was like but why is she dating him, he's so ugly

44
00:02:06,975 --> 00:02:09,255
but she has a really ugly character

45
00:02:09,255 --> 00:02:12,215
so it sorta works out but all of a sudden, poof

46
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:15,105
all of a sudden they broke up and everyone was like: why? and then he made a really

47
00:02:15,105 --> 00:02:18,415
crying video saying; ohh she hit me

48
00:02:18,415 --> 00:02:21,085
and then Nicole replied; well it did not hit her

49
00:02:21,085 --> 00:02:23,895
it's bullsh*t it's not true, I did not

50
00:02:23,895 --> 00:02:26,905
hit her, I did not and then Matthew

51
00:02:26,905 --> 00:02:29,945
made a video a few months later saying I am depressed

52
00:02:29,945 --> 00:02:32,265
and then now Nicole is making fun of depression

53
00:02:32,265 --> 00:02:35,285
because she wants to get back at her ex

54
00:02:35,285 --> 00:02:38,305
that's right, we dig deep here on Pew News haha

55
00:02:38,305 --> 00:02:41,105
No for real Nicole I sorta understand

56
00:02:41,105 --> 00:02:44,075
what she's trying to say, most people go through periods in their

57
00:02:44,075 --> 00:02:47,085
life when they are feeling down and that's not the same as

58
00:02:47,085 --> 00:02:50,340
depression, a lot of people already don't think that depression

59
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,125
is not a real illness with real symptoms so

60
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:56,180
trivializing it as *inaudible noise* you are just feeling bad

61
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,595
is irresponsible just

62
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:01,325
flat out short sighted and complete lack of empathy

63
00:03:01,325 --> 00:03:04,335
for other people. Just because something worked for you

64
00:03:04,335 --> 00:03:07,345
doesn't mean it's gonna work for other people, same thing with diet

65
00:03:07,345 --> 00:03:10,565
everyone is different and react differently to

66
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:13,040
these things, it's just how it is

67
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,140
just cuz you figured out something doesn't mean you have the answer for everyone

68
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:21,140
pepepepepepeppepepeepppeppepeppwwwwwww

69
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:23,605
I'm Gloria Borger and the next news is

70
00:03:23,605 --> 00:03:26,315
very interesting, that's right

71
00:03:26,315 --> 00:03:28,905
last week, Drake, famous

72
00:03:28,905 --> 00:03:31,695
Canadian rapper, played Fortnite

73
00:03:31,695 --> 00:03:34,785
and everyone lost their mind it was the greatest thing

74
00:03:34,785 --> 00:03:37,835
it was the greatest thing that has ever happened to the internet

75
00:03:37,835 --> 00:03:40,645
the fact that another human being plays video games

76
00:03:40,645 --> 00:03:43,355
just blew everyone's mind. This

77
00:03:43,355 --> 00:03:46,125
live stream broke a Twitch record and it also came out in a recent

78
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,735
interview that Ninja makes

79
00:03:48,735 --> 00:03:51,725
$500,000 a month playing video games that is

80
00:03:51,725 --> 00:03:55,040
almost as much as I make

81
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,460
*drinking*

82
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,980
*still drinking* *coughs loudly*

83
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,880
whenever there is success in a certain feild

84
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,500
online there is always a swarm of people coming

85
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,345
afterwards, you have the flies to

86
00:04:07,345 --> 00:04:10,505
pies, the cretins to the sweatens

87
00:04:10,505 --> 00:04:13,105
the maggots swarming to the ffff

88
00:04:13,105 --> 00:04:14,200
fff-ine *claps*

89
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,080
*claps* *claps* *claps* *claps*

90
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:20,120
so Logan Paul of course, the low-life scumbag

91
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,045
renounced that he is going to do a Twitch live stream as well

92
00:04:23,045 --> 00:04:25,785
which is apparently news worthy because he gained 200,000

93
00:04:25,785 --> 00:04:28,625
followers without even live streaming, uh

94
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:31,695
excuse me, excuse me okay

95
00:04:31,695 --> 00:04:34,535
I have 900,000 followers

96
00:04:34,535 --> 00:04:37,465
and I never stream on Twitch why does no one care

97
00:04:37,465 --> 00:04:40,485
about me :( If this doesn't once and for  all prove

98
00:04:40,485 --> 00:04:43,260
the fact that the media is bias towards me

99
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,440
then I don't know what will *sassy tone*

100
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,905
a lot of Twitch streamers had thoughts about this, we had Summit saying that

101
00:04:48,905 --> 00:04:51,995
I don't think people should be upset at all

102
00:04:51,995 --> 00:04:53,555
about Logan Paul on Twitch

103
00:04:53,555 --> 00:04:55,185
The amount of people he bring

104
00:04:55,185 --> 00:04:57,765
over from YouTube can only be a good thing for the site

105
00:04:57,765 --> 00:05:00,695
because there's more people now *inaudible noise* use

106
00:05:00,695 --> 00:05:05,505
your business mind on this one

107
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:06,965
*LOLing intensifies*

108
00:05:06,965 --> 00:05:09,955
yes, great, now other people are saying

109
00:05:09,955 --> 00:05:12,915
so Logan Paul is gonna start streaming and bring his sh*tty

110
00:05:12,915 --> 00:05:15,665
should I read this in a female voice? *activates female voice*

111
00:05:15,665 --> 00:05:18,745
so Logan Paul is gonna start streaming and bring his sh*tty toxic

112
00:05:18,745 --> 00:05:21,540
idiot fanbase over to Twitch... can't

113
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:24,400
see that doing anything positive for the community as a whole

114
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,040
lol

115
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:30,220
they're all kids, they're all kids, they're all kids, it's not important

116
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:33,235
it doesn't matter, nothing matters, stop, just stop

117
00:05:33,235 --> 00:05:36,265
please, why do you care? It also

118
00:05:36,265 --> 00:05:39,480
shows that Logan Paul is planning to do a Fortnite livestream with

119
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,000
rapper Soulja Boy

120
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,340
Logan: I think you can... I think you can like link between

121
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,000
the system

122
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,780
Soulja Boy: wait is this like *inaudible* play together ASAP

123
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:48,740
Logan: for sure

124
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:51,285
why would anyone wanna see that, like

125
00:05:51,285 --> 00:05:54,035
the reason the Drake Fortnite thing was popular was cuz

126
00:05:54,035 --> 00:05:57,095
Ninja is actually really good at Fortnite combined

127
00:05:57,095 --> 00:05:59,885
with a really popular celebrity which in a

128
00:05:59,885 --> 00:06:03,115
sense, I don't wanna give this credit but I'm gonna do it for the sake of

129
00:06:03,115 --> 00:06:05,855
F*ck Logan Paul, it legitimized the

130
00:06:05,855 --> 00:06:08,865
streaming community in a way that hasn't been done before

131
00:06:08,865 --> 00:06:10,045
ahhhh

132
00:06:10,045 --> 00:06:12,535
it hurts to say that. No one's gonna

133
00:06:12,535 --> 00:06:15,495
wanna see these bafoons play, it's so moronic

134
00:06:15,495 --> 00:06:18,785
why does he think he can do the same thing?

135
00:06:18,785 --> 00:06:21,905
my god, is this what we have come to now in

136
00:06:21,905 --> 00:06:24,245
online entertainment, whatever's popular everyone

137
00:06:24,245 --> 00:06:27,275
else is just going to do. Oh shoot that's what I've been doing

138
00:06:27,275 --> 00:06:30,375
for years. Dammit. Ignore the last bit guys, don't worry

139
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:33,175
about it, just mug, a mug

140
00:06:33,175 --> 00:06:34,275
pewpewpewpew

141
00:06:34,275 --> 00:06:37,245
next news come from

142
00:06:37,245 --> 00:06:40,155
YouTuber convicted of hate crime for making a

143
00:06:40,155 --> 00:06:43,165
nazi joke, just hold on one second

144
00:06:43,165 --> 00:06:44,795
guys

145
00:06:44,795 --> 00:06:47,755
excuse me PewDiePie's laywer

146
00:06:47,755 --> 00:06:50,815
am I going to jail?

147
00:06:50,815 --> 00:06:55,000
no because I am more attractive and more popular?

148
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
okay, that makes sense

149
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,380
So what do I do?

150
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,800
Pewds' Lawyer: Just tell everyone that you're really upset about this

151
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,460
uh huh, got it

152
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:06,245
this is absolutely despicable, why

153
00:07:06,245 --> 00:07:09,355
anyone would make a nazi joke is completely beyond me

154
00:07:09,355 --> 00:07:12,875
especially pug related, that's like the lowest of the low

155
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:15,685
the fact that it was a joke doesn't matter at all. I don't

156
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:18,260
understand these people with their terrible senses of humor

157
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:21,300
disgusting, absolutely disgusting

158
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,480
Count Dankula need to go to jail, and I'm so glad

159
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,465
that this man is put behind bars because now I finally

160
00:07:27,465 --> 00:07:30,065
will feel safe at night knowing that this man

161
00:07:30,065 --> 00:07:33,575
will not make anymore Nazi jokes, disgusting

162
00:07:33,575 --> 00:07:36,695
absolutely despicable, hate crime

163
00:07:36,695 --> 00:07:39,775
hate crime, boo, now I'm boast about

164
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:42,275
this on social media so everyone can like me and

165
00:07:42,275 --> 00:07:45,195
and think that I'm actually good even though I actually have no

166
00:07:45,195 --> 00:07:47,955
positive qualities about me except shunting

167
00:07:47,955 --> 00:07:50,415
other people even though I'm *weird noise*

168
00:07:50,415 --> 00:07:53,355
The real question here, I know you're thinking

169
00:07:53,355 --> 00:07:57,005
as well, why hasn't the pug gone to jail?

170
00:07:57,005 --> 00:07:59,845
why is the pug allowed to keep spreading

171
00:07:59,845 --> 00:08:02,265
hate crime? absolutely

172
00:08:02,265 --> 00:08:05,305
there is truly no justice in this world

173
00:08:05,305 --> 00:08:08,005
for real though, uhh basically if you haven't seen the video

174
00:08:08,005 --> 00:08:11,355
I don't wanna show it because it's probably  just going to

175
00:08:11,355 --> 00:08:14,315
demonotise this video and it probably is already

176
00:08:14,315 --> 00:08:17,155
please buy a mug, but never the less he

177
00:08:17,155 --> 00:08:19,955
basically said uh I want to get back at my girlfriend

178
00:08:19,955 --> 00:08:22,995
while she's away, so I'm going to play a prank on her

179
00:08:22,995 --> 00:08:25,915
so I'm going to teach her to dog to uhh

180
00:08:25,915 --> 00:08:28,985
to be a nazi, which is the ugliest thing I can

181
00:08:28,985 --> 00:08:32,105
think of. That was the pretext of the video, that

182
00:08:32,105 --> 00:08:35,065
is the context, it was clearly set out to be

183
00:08:35,065 --> 00:08:38,105
a joke and anyone who watched the video will understand that

184
00:08:38,105 --> 00:08:41,105
but you can also take what was taken out of

185
00:08:41,105 --> 00:08:43,455
context, which seems to be a

186
00:08:43,455 --> 00:08:46,395
a common theme these days and completely

187
00:08:46,395 --> 00:08:49,675
dismay the fact that it was indeed just a joke

188
00:08:49,675 --> 00:08:52,665
it's supposed to be a joke, you may not find it funny

189
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:55,540
but that doesn't change the fact of the intent

190
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:58,260
behind it. Ricky Gervais, British comedian

191
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,560
uhh tweeted out about this saying

192
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,435
A man has been convicted in UK court of making a joke

193
00:09:03,435 --> 00:09:05,945
that deemed ''grossly offensive''.

194
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:08,895
If you don't believe in a person's right to say things

195
00:09:08,895 --> 00:09:11,705
''grossly offensive'', then you don't believe in Freedom of Speech.

196
00:09:11,705 --> 00:09:14,445
which is so true, basically, if you're curious

197
00:09:14,445 --> 00:09:16,825
why he got convicted even though we do have

198
00:09:16,825 --> 00:09:19,965
Freedom of Speech there are a few exceptions to the law

199
00:09:19,965 --> 00:09:23,285
there's a broad sweep of exception including, threatening, abusive

200
00:09:23,285 --> 00:09:26,425
or insulting words or behavior intending to likely

201
00:09:26,425 --> 00:09:29,265
to cause harassment, alarm or distress

202
00:09:29,265 --> 00:09:32,185
what he was convicted for was

203
00:09:32,185 --> 00:09:34,895
the 127 communications act

204
00:09:34,895 --> 00:09:37,735
which makes a criminal offensive to send online

205
00:09:37,735 --> 00:09:40,725
a grossly offensive or indecent,

206
00:09:40,725 --> 00:09:43,185
obscene or menacing character

207
00:09:43,185 --> 00:09:46,325
there's a lot of people defending this verdict saying

208
00:09:46,325 --> 00:09:49,115
that he deserves to go to jail, ummm

209
00:09:49,115 --> 00:09:52,245
Stewart Perrie from The LAD Bible wrote this,

210
00:09:52,245 --> 00:09:54,515
that's right LAD Bible does news *weird laugh like noise*

211
00:09:54,515 --> 00:09:55,105
It's

212
00:09:55,105 --> 00:09:58,125
Worth noting that those against political

213
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:00,355
correctness cry that

214
00:10:00,355 --> 00:10:03,395
it's only recently that their jokes are offennsive

215
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:06,445
they've probably always been hurtful, it's just that

216
00:10:06,445 --> 00:10:09,500
those at the butt of the joke are now standing

217
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,340
up for themselves, food for

218
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,340
thought

219
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,775
*clap*

220
00:10:14,775 --> 00:10:17,285
thank you Stewart Perrie

221
00:10:17,285 --> 00:10:19,355
thank you for showing everyone

222
00:10:19,355 --> 00:10:21,555
what a quintessential morale looks like

223
00:10:21,555 --> 00:10:24,705
you're supposed to be a journalist, although it's from LAD

224
00:10:24,705 --> 00:10:27,420
Bible, you're still supposed to be a journalist. Do you

225
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,385
understand what you're writing? DO you understand anything at all?

226
00:10:30,385 --> 00:10:33,440
What you're saying? or what you wrote?

227
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,120
What the f*ck?!

228
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,380
yes, Count Dankula is not above criticism, anyone has the

229
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,080
right to speak out against him

230
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,940
people have the right to feel whatever way they want about the video

231
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:48,105
like it, dislike it, it doesn't matter, the point is it's not up to the Government to decide whether

232
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:50,465
it's a joke or not, it's a really

233
00:10:50,465 --> 00:10:53,425
scary thing for any society that the government has

234
00:10:53,425 --> 00:10:55,135
that power in my opinion

235
00:10:55,135 --> 00:10:57,465
that to me doesn't mean freedom of speech

236
00:10:57,465 --> 00:10:59,595
we have laws to protect from hate crimes

237
00:10:59,595 --> 00:11:02,645
but they shouldn't cover what is meant as jokes

238
00:11:02,645 --> 00:11:05,720
and what clearly isn't set out to be

239
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,620
any form of ill intent and harm and anyone that watched the

240
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,975
video knows that that's the case and

241
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:13,795
I think it's just the same thing with my original video, yes it was

242
00:11:13,795 --> 00:11:16,940
my video about criticism, absolutely not, but anyone

243
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:20,025
that watched the video understands that there was no ill

244
00:11:20,025 --> 00:11:22,860
intent behind it, but it's so easy now a days to just take

245
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,680
any clip out of context and say; this

246
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,480
is hateful, this is not a joke. It's a dangerous act

247
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,565
especially now that the government comes into play, that being said

248
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:33,805
I already have too many things in common with Count

249
00:11:33,805 --> 00:11:36,515
Dankula, so I am now going to

250
00:11:36,515 --> 00:11:39,355
auction away this pug, that's right

251
00:11:39,355 --> 00:11:42,495
he is a despicable pug that will put me *laughs*

252
00:11:42,495 --> 00:11:48,615
into jail, so please, someone take this dog way from me, I do not want him

253
00:11:48,615 --> 00:11:51,575
anymore and I don't want anything to do with

254
00:11:51,575 --> 00:11:52,575
with Count Dankula

255
00:11:52,575 --> 00:11:53,895
*very cute pug yawn*

256
00:11:53,895 --> 00:11:55,445
oh am I boring you?

257
00:11:55,445 --> 00:11:57,415
ppppppppppppp

258
00:11:57,415 --> 00:12:00,285
I am Gloria Borger, and this was Pew News everybody

259
00:12:00,285 --> 00:12:01,995
remember to leave a like

260
00:12:01,995 --> 00:12:04,305
this video is 100% going to

261
00:12:04,305 --> 00:12:07,335
flag for demonotisation, so I'd really appreciate if you checked out the mug

262
00:12:07,335 --> 00:12:10,075
It's... I'm out of drink so I don't even know why

263
00:12:10,075 --> 00:12:12,965
why I tried but thank you and nameste and goodbye

264
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:15,585
goodnight Americans

265
00:12:15,585 --> 00:12:28,000
people too
