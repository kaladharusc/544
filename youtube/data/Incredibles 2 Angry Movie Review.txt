2
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:12,830
hey guys we just got back from

3
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:15,330
Incredibles - now I know this film has

4
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,640
been out for a little while but you know

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,420
I was at e3 and it would have this come

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,890
up to Thursday Friday so monday review

7
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,289
here quickly because I do want to add my

8
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:31,230
opinion to it Incredibles was well it

9
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:32,340
was incredible

10
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,400
the first Incredibles I was wondering I

11
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,410
think I had missing and I only seen

12
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:40,230
segments of it so I refreshed myself by

13
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,090
watching the original before I watched

14
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,190
this one it was just as good it was

15
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:46,410
amazing it kind of had this sort of

16
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,460
charm to it it's less kind of like a

17
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:52,760
dynamic less scripted feel to it and

18
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,530
charming in the sense that we've seen it

19
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,570
done so many other times you know like

20
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,370
super elf families or this sort of

21
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,670
awkward and this kind of thing going and

22
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:04,680
and that was actually the film that

23
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,259
started everything so now we have a

24
00:01:07,259 --> 00:01:12,360
sequel almost 14 years later which I'm

25
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,880
surprised everybody kind of sounds like

26
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,250
they should I think maybe the mom

27
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,890
sounded a little bit older but and and I

28
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:22,170
think they they sort of got but they

29
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,300
nailed the voices mostly I was thinking

30
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,429
that there'd be some kind of you know

31
00:01:26,429 --> 00:01:28,649
time-skip there but there's no time

32
00:01:28,649 --> 00:01:31,110
skipping this in fact this film picks up

33
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,539
as the first one is ending it's

34
00:01:33,539 --> 00:01:36,420
literally just a continuation of the

35
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,599
story and the storyline of the first one

36
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,520
is that you know superheroes had gotten

37
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,619
banned and they were sort of living

38
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:46,229
underground they continued that here and

39
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:49,759
this is a story about how they put

40
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,679
elastic girl which is the mother

41
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:55,200
character front and center in fact she's

42
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,970
the main character I'd say probably of

43
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:59,759
the film most of this film in order to

44
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,239
try to galvanize public support to bring

45
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:06,360
superheroes back and there's you know

46
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,459
this villain out here sort of a

47
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:10,739
mind-control villain through screen

48
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:11,670
slavers

49
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:14,280
yeah exactly which I guess is relevant

50
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,790
to today's problems and issues with you

51
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,799
know iPads and social medias taking over

52
00:02:19,799 --> 00:02:22,270
everything but it wasn't too pervasive

53
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:27,340
ultimately the film was really enjoyable

54
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:30,520
at least for me now it started off I

55
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,070
gotta be honest like I didn't know who

56
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,440
the film was for and by the end I

57
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,940
definitely know who it's for this film

58
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:39,820
is for adults okay this is not a kids

59
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:42,100
it's not gonna entertain little kids

60
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,470
there's gonna be segments of it that do

61
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,570
is retain little parts here and there

62
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:49,960
but it's very story centric very story

63
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:53,650
heavy lots of real a longer dialogue

64
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:57,460
sections dealing with even the boring

65
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,980
parts the boring parts yes I was gonna

66
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,190
get to that I was bored and in many

67
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:05,620
sections of the film but by the end it

68
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:09,010
had hooked me and I appreciated some of

69
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:10,810
those sections setting up this storyline

70
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:13,380
but ultimately I felt that that was

71
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,820
unnecessary and I know it would have

72
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,430
been a much stronger film like I was

73
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,470
hoping for a grand slam you know if if

74
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,660
Pixar's gonna be doing sequels I was

75
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,340
hoping to really knock this one out of

76
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,410
the park and they don't but you see

77
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:29,280
flashes of what the film could have been

78
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,130
I'll say right away jack-jack steals the

79
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,220
film he's the reason I loved it I wanted

80
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,710
him to have more screen time young that

81
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:41,290
little baby what kind of powers does he

82
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:45,760
have Joffrey and they're all super funny

83
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,840
and he's just magnetic when he's on

84
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,180
screen you just love his little voices

85
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:56,800
baby Gaga googoo his talk in his powers

86
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,140
and you just wanted to see more of Jack

87
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:02,170
Jack I would pay double to see a film of

88
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:06,070
Jack Jack and I think the film focuses

89
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:08,830
far too much on you know the theme of

90
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:11,710
the work life relationship okay but

91
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,480
let's talk about the boring parts cuz

92
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,310
it's what weighs down the film yeah it's

93
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:17,470
this work life relationship and they

94
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:18,220
dance

95
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:21,730
don't raise kids and so he was yeah dad

96
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,620
dad you're trying to convey as kids the

97
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,660
third kid and somehow he never he just

98
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,520
she's like are you can't you can handle

99
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,540
it's like this is the third one's not

100
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,160
the first one that probably helped raise

101
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,520
the other two kids it just did

102
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,229
it seemed unnatural and it was really

103
00:04:34,229 --> 00:04:37,250
dragging during a lot of these parts

104
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,379
especially when and then there's sort of

105
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:43,770
faked animosity between mr. incredible

106
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:47,610
and a lack elastic girl on the center

107
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,860
saij stuff it doesn't feel as genuine

108
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,470
because they've been through the first

109
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:55,440
film where they thought as a family and

110
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,870
and they came together and it's this

111
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:01,250
positive thing but they turn about face

112
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:04,080
elastic girls complaining again about

113
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,440
being superheroes it felt disingenuous

114
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,229
it felt going back into the old pattern

115
00:05:10,229 --> 00:05:12,389
and kind of resetting things and then

116
00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:14,419
mr. incredible being jealous of

117
00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:16,650
Elastigirl getting the center stage

118
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,930
she's got this fancy new suit the PR

119
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:21,000
company trying to bring back heroes only

120
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,909
cares about her and it's and and to be

121
00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:26,250
fair she does a good job fact she does

122
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,810
probably a better job than mr.

123
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:29,250
incredible yeah it was super weird that

124
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:32,940
they because they try to frame him as

125
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,560
like a dad who didn't know how to raise

126
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,240
his kids and it was Jenny who was

127
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,400
genuinely not happy for his wife like he

128
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,900
was upset that he wasn't gonna go out

129
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,330
and do that and I just watching it was

130
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:44,069
shit all over his Karen we just watched

131
00:05:44,069 --> 00:05:45,539
the first movie and then watching this

132
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:47,190
once like I don't believe that he would

133
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,810
just be like I get you know it's

134
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:51,330
supposed to be like 1961 the breadwinner

135
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:53,880
I bring home Ryan that that's what I'm

136
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,560
but I don't I refuse to believe in a

137
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,659
character that we've watched for several

138
00:05:57,659 --> 00:05:59,669
hours just turns in to be like his pay

139
00:05:59,669 --> 00:06:02,190
exactly sit calm down exactly and that

140
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:04,979
was the 1960s feel to it I guess they're

141
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:07,680
trying to sort of expand on that but you

142
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,740
never really feel that too much in the

143
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,270
film just you could see it in the deco

144
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:15,120
but in certain in terms of the times you

145
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,259
don't really see you see female

146
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:18,870
superheroes as much or maybe more so

147
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,490
than the male super has in fact this

148
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:22,949
this film has the female superhero has

149
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:25,169
the sort of lead and the focus of the

150
00:06:25,169 --> 00:06:27,930
film but Joe what are some of the

151
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:31,080
positive things of the film the positive

152
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,419
stay yes it's like the animation oh yeah

153
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:37,080
his suit is super detailed on everything

154
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,260
Waterfall Me's one of all in the house

155
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,120
there's an entire scene where it's

156
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,250
nothing like the Playboy Mansion no

157
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,200
point to this house there's no point to

158
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,730
the scene it's way longer than it needs

159
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,050
me but they just want to show you how

160
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:49,990
cool they can make water look and

161
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:52,400
pressing all sorts of vines creating

162
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,890
like waterfalls and new pools and it was

163
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:58,100
it was just that the graphics have been

164
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,050
updated and they've been updated

165
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:02,180
appropriately and that really helps in

166
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,670
the action scenes and the way the camera

167
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:06,620
moves during the action scene you're

168
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,750
getting a lot more cinematic angles they

169
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,820
do this thing with the suit cameras on

170
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,740
the suits and that kind of gives you a

171
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,480
cinematic perspective and it shows

172
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,370
people what super arrows have to deal

173
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:19,040
with because they make a good point you

174
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,680
know in these films were all like oh my

175
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,660
god why are these people so mad at

176
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,820
superheroes but it's because they

177
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,100
literally don't see anything all they

178
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,930
see is the destruction and then the

179
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:31,760
superhero walking out and if you didn't

180
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,200
catch the bad guy then you're like well

181
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,030
fuck that guy look at all that shit yeah

182
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:40,070
so I felt like a very uneven film our

183
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:42,140
lows were really low but its highs were

184
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:44,360
really high yeah there was way more

185
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,610
loads than those eyes man the highs were

186
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:48,680
really 10 out of 10 well you know did

187
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,850
you ever see Jack the baby

188
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:51,680
Jack Jack well you see Jack Jack Attack

189
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,330
it's a short that's oh it's great it's

190
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:54,620
incredibly getting watch it because it's

191
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,690
nothing but a short all about Jack Jack

192
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:58,640
and his powers whoa oh really really

193
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,080
good and that's what this movie should

194
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,610
have been you know at least more scenes

195
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:04,940
of that boring yes and in fact Jack Jack

196
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:08,300
never really gets to utilize his powers

197
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:12,080
offensively against in a in an

198
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,580
interesting story way there is an

199
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,920
amazing scene in the backyard of this

200
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,740
mansion with and I want to spoil

201
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,780
anything for you it is worth the price

202
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:23,330
of admission alone I was laughing so

203
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:25,070
much I was having such a good time with

204
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:27,290
Jack Jack but he's really the only

205
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:30,110
really good standout moment it almost

206
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,690
sort of takes some of the fun away from

207
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:35,960
the film I know what they're trying to

208
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,270
do but this just seems geared more

209
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:42,110
towards adults it did there's a lot of

210
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:45,170
political stuff - yeah the PR stuff

211
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:47,630
trying to and the

212
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:50,030
what is it the diplomats and and trying

213
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,490
to get the super hills and their lengthy

214
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,500
exposition scenes explaining the whole

215
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,530
shit and we're like come on come on can

216
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:00,260
we just get to some super Harold saving

217
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,390
stuff and and what did you think about

218
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:04,670
the ultimate sort of threat of the film

219
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:07,400
I honestly thought is very predictable

220
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:12,170
and it lacked yeah that there's no

221
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:15,470
threat that and they beat the threat

222
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:18,320
very very easily but I guess that's not

223
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,260
the points that Brad Bird the director

224
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,180
and writer is trying to get across here

225
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:26,360
or it just was wholly unsatisfying in

226
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:31,250
terms of the villain character and sort

227
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:34,700
of who they have to fight to overcome it

228
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,860
in the climax while the climax was

229
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:39,830
satisfying and then in certain extent

230
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:43,250
you just didn't feel you know tension in

231
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,440
the scenes because you know one they're

232
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,270
gonna beat up I mean we got this baby

233
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,700
who's got seventeen different powers and

234
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:52,640
just random I love them yeah if you want

235
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,450
to see them all in but yes so while I

236
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:59,690
look on Rotten Tomatoes it's like 94 in

237
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:01,880
critics and then the audience like 89 I

238
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,040
think I'm a little bit below that I

239
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:07,790
enjoyed The Incredibles one more than

240
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:10,580
over the Incredibles too despite the

241
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,320
better cinematography the better

242
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,710
graphics the more entertaining segments

243
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,270
with Jack Jack which is really the

244
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:19,940
standout moment in these films but other

245
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:22,240
than that yeah we get some new

246
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,530
superheroes but there's sort of side

247
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:26,270
supporting characters that we don't

248
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:28,760
really see much at all yeah you want to

249
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,200
see I want to see more of some of them

250
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,089
away less of other ones that didn't

251
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,170
matter and then there was some

252
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:34,910
interaction between them but it was so

253
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:37,100
short it could they could have had a

254
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:40,460
really big fight scene a really big

255
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,990
climax something and if we just got

256
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:43,160
little bits and pieces that were

257
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,110
resolved kind of conveniently and quick

258
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:48,500
this one like they finished off with

259
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,990
being a family unit and you don't feel

260
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:53,240
the chemistry between any of them mm-hmm

261
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,790
it kind of sucks yeah you do you have

262
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:58,759
that stronger sense of family unity at

263
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:00,619
the end of the first bill and then they

264
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:03,259
kind of artificially disrupted here and

265
00:11:03,259 --> 00:11:05,509
it doesn't feel the same you don't get

266
00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:07,850
that same feeling and so you they should

267
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:09,829
have gone Ralph akan on it rather than

268
00:11:09,829 --> 00:11:11,899
sort of repeating some of the same

269
00:11:11,899 --> 00:11:14,119
elements from the first film

270
00:11:14,119 --> 00:11:16,100
it might have been stronger taking a

271
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,769
little bit of a time jump or focusing on

272
00:11:18,769 --> 00:11:19,519
Jarek Jack

273
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,759
anyways go ahead wait what are you ready

274
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:27,290
nothing yet oh sorry so um the first one

275
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:29,480
I would say a nine out of ten I love

276
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,379
that one yeah this one I might have said

277
00:11:33,379 --> 00:11:35,089
some people was seven I feel like this

278
00:11:35,089 --> 00:11:37,009
is like a seven it was good you both

279
00:11:37,009 --> 00:11:39,529
been doing jelly balls enjoy boy I had

280
00:11:39,529 --> 00:11:42,379
some great times but it just didn't feel

281
00:11:42,379 --> 00:11:46,309
like ya feel genuine I'm with you Joe

282
00:11:46,309 --> 00:11:47,600
what do you think I think this is a

283
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,389
Pixar for and I don't think it's that

284
00:11:50,389 --> 00:11:52,610
more so I love all the Pixar catalog of

285
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:54,199
all the movies that Pixar is made this

286
00:11:54,199 --> 00:11:56,540
is below average for them oh wow for

287
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,459
Justin Justin Pixar movies right so well

288
00:11:58,459 --> 00:12:00,529
if you and you're looking I'm not giving

289
00:12:00,529 --> 00:12:01,730
him I never given my full rating yet

290
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:04,129
okay Justin pictures movies like there's

291
00:12:04,129 --> 00:12:06,679
a lot to be disappointed about below

292
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:08,689
average picks top for sure

293
00:12:08,689 --> 00:12:12,139
the slow scenes were slow and though I

294
00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:14,779
mean they were really but the high

295
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:16,249
scenes were really really good I really

296
00:12:16,249 --> 00:12:17,749
really enjoyed some of the some of it

297
00:12:17,749 --> 00:12:20,299
and I wanted more of it I saw this dude

298
00:12:20,299 --> 00:12:22,910
laughing and smiling and I rarely see

299
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,429
that so yes it did I there were some

300
00:12:25,429 --> 00:12:26,869
really really good parts that I that I

301
00:12:26,869 --> 00:12:28,459
really enjoyed I just wish we got more

302
00:12:28,459 --> 00:12:28,970
of them

303
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,649
yeah well I'm actually I'm with OJ here

304
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:32,629
I think this is a seven I understand

305
00:12:32,629 --> 00:12:34,009
where some people would be a little

306
00:12:34,009 --> 00:12:37,399
happier than me maybe yes this is more

307
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:39,980
of their type of movie I didn't buy into

308
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,509
the like there was so much parent

309
00:12:41,509 --> 00:12:43,100
pandering which is great and I

310
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,230
appreciate a lot of it good call I mean

311
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:47,420
I was more pandering I was I was a math

312
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,829
tutor for a really long time and that

313
00:12:48,829 --> 00:12:50,720
whole scene I've just I've lived that

314
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,799
scene where the parents just like what

315
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:53,360
do you mean math is new like it was

316
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,819
nothing but trying to say your parents I

317
00:12:55,819 --> 00:12:57,259
get you like it but there was a lot of

318
00:12:57,259 --> 00:12:59,089
scenes mr. incredible tries to help his

319
00:12:59,089 --> 00:13:02,540
son yeah and so I just didn't I didn't

320
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:04,129
care as much because it wasn't for me so

321
00:13:04,129 --> 00:13:06,590
seven out of ten

322
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:07,910
you're looking at that you're probably

323
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:10,400
gonna be disappointed for some some big

324
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,080
adventure and a Grand Slam

325
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,030
six seven is probably where you're going

326
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:16,220
to end up however by the end of the film

327
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:20,420
I figured out the voice that Brad Bird

328
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:22,820
wanted to do here considering the first

329
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,730
film was 14 years old I think he really

330
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:28,400
was purposefully making this film for an

331
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,890
older crowd not for younger people not

332
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:33,470
for crowd pleasers or you know sort of

333
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:36,290
you know popcorn you know eaters and

334
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:37,400
munchers he's trying to do something

335
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,730
more with it so I do appreciate that but

336
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:43,400
it took away of some of the adventure so

337
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,280
I'm probably gonna end up at about I

338
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,440
don't want to pick the same rating y'all

339
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,510
is but I'm gonna have to do it because

340
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:53,270
that's the right rating seven out of ten

341
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:55,880
I was I was inching towards eight and

342
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,470
that's why all that justification was

343
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,330
there to try to get that there but I

344
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:02,660
can't it is a seven out of ten I really

345
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,430
don't see what the critics are seeing

346
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:09,230
you know and with the higher ratings but

347
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:12,230
here's the thing 7 out of 10 does not

348
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:14,960
mean it's a it's a bad film it doesn't

349
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,370
mean it's a film you shouldn't go out

350
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:19,040
and see in fact I'm gonna I'm gonna give

351
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,590
it a badass seal of approval how about

352
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:25,460
that as a sort of extra stamp a bonus to

353
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,530
let you guys know that I do in fact love

354
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:29,900
the film and I want you to see it in

355
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:33,530
theaters and the whole argument that

356
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:36,830
that all Pixar you know shouldn't be

357
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:38,630
making seekers they should make original

358
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:42,170
content I agree in many aspects but when

359
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:45,230
you can show flashes of brilliance in a

360
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:47,210
sequel like this and you were just

361
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:50,060
focusing in the wrong areas I really

362
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:52,220
want them to give it another shot you

363
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:55,430
know I mean Incredibles 3 focusing on

364
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:57,890
that Jack Jack baby character or give me

365
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:00,560
another Jack Jack Attack you too I'll go

366
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,620
watch Jack Jack Attack too so you know I

367
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:07,100
am excited Pixar is gonna have five new

368
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,350
original properties it's either four or

369
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:12,380
five after Toy Story 4 because they're

370
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,270
getting a lot of flack for doing sequels

371
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:16,190
and they said we don't like to see we

372
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:17,540
don't want to do sequels even though

373
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,190
they they start doing seagulls a Toy

374
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,100
Story

375
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,690
and then cars which really didn't

376
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:24,960
deserve it first one yeah and and so now

377
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:28,980
in Incredibles - you know I hope they do

378
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,870
in Incredibles 3 that's what I'm trying

379
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:32,850
to say because I think they do give it

380
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:35,070
one more shot and don't listen to people

381
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:37,050
say no I don't want sequels because if

382
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:39,720
you're doing this well and you can

383
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,490
target it a little bit better if they're

384
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:42,960
well worth it and I enjoy it

385
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,390
families stick together so you spend the

386
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:48,360
first time doing Incredibles 1 bringing

387
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,490
the family together and at the end you

388
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:52,980
see that unity it's amazing and then on

389
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:55,380
this second film that just falls apart

390
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:57,780
you feel Brewin give up a base spin the

391
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:00,210
first hour just get to good will they

392
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:02,040
break them up for the first hour yeah

393
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,840
film and then they only get back

394
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,040
together when the movie starts getting

395
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,010
exact like give us all of them together

396
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:13,560
and yeah fighting together they isolated

397
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,000
the mom character for the longest time

398
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,130
sidelined the dad character this is the

399
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:18,780
weaknesses we're bringing back

400
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,520
weaknesses you see we're a little

401
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,470
conflicted because we like it but we can

402
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:25,710
see the glaring weaknesses critics as

403
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:29,370
critics so mood so let's do a very short

404
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:31,470
spoiler section not really much the

405
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:33,450
spoiler you're in this kind of thing so

406
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,190
thank you so much for watching and we

407
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:37,290
will see you guys on the next Andrew Joe

408
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:51,240
show

409
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:54,580
okay a quick spoiler section so what did

410
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,649
I edit out the Underminer gets away

411
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:58,779
which doesn't matter the wax Underminer

412
00:16:58,779 --> 00:17:01,750
no fucking under all the mold guy yeah

413
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,059
well I thought you spoiled I'm gonna

414
00:17:04,059 --> 00:17:05,770
listening no one harder he gets away

415
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:08,260
just doesn't matter oh well fuck okay so

416
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:11,110
the under minor doesn't matter he gets

417
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:14,470
away but I thought you revealed to you

418
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:18,120
no no the scanner person who's that with

419
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,670
screen slavers green slaver turns out to

420
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:24,670
be the sister character of this new PR

421
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:27,640
firm oh yeah I was extremely predictable

422
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:31,500
I was hoping that maybe it would be

423
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,880
committed as out of them this is our

424
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:37,720
film there's like it was too predictable

425
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,460
it was either gonna be the guy or the

426
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,800
girl and honestly the girl sitting there

427
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,720
in the shadows she's just dude you know

428
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,500
pick trying to get real close to elastic

429
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:51,850
girl talking to a minor and it's fucking

430
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:52,179
her

431
00:17:52,179 --> 00:17:56,350
so predictable so you know lame reveal

432
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:59,679
and it just felt like you know a do-over

433
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,320
from the first film where they they do

434
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,929
this oh hey you know it's in fact that's

435
00:18:04,929 --> 00:18:07,330
the I should have put this in the review

436
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:09,929
they repeated the first film too much

437
00:18:09,929 --> 00:18:13,179
because remember it was the father

438
00:18:13,179 --> 00:18:15,400
going out on superhero two benches on

439
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,140
the island beating up the robots and

440
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,730
they were like oh great job we're gonna

441
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,559
bring the super O's back and we love you

442
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,120
doing your Supergirl thing what do you

443
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,740
think we could do they did with a girl

444
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,750
and the girls out there but y'all great

445
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:28,240
job here and then they betrayed him and

446
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,160
then they betrayed her it's like what

447
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,010
the fuck oh now I see what some of the

448
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:35,679
high top critics would say about

449
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,809
creative bankruptcy except for none of

450
00:18:37,809 --> 00:18:40,059
the critics said that it's getting super

451
00:18:40,059 --> 00:18:42,820
high ratings it was always it was just

452
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,200
these other articles that were written

453
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,720
before this one came out that we're

454
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,429
talking about how Pixar's creatively

455
00:18:48,429 --> 00:18:49,870
bankrupt because they have to do like

456
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:52,419
sequels and I think that's bullshit just

457
00:18:52,419 --> 00:18:54,040
because they released one sequel there

458
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,750
wasn't as critically acclaimed it was

459
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,970
like finding dory came out at the same

460
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:01,020
time it was like Zootopia and

461
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,900
Milana which were better films and

462
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:07,350
crowded out you know finding dory there

463
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:09,930
were like oh this guy is following Pixar

464
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:13,020
is finished well at least that's no they

465
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,400
gotta get the click so that's the way

466
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,780
they were writing the articles they were

467
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,660
just saying that you know that they

468
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,580
don't like the sequels and we hope we

469
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,380
see more creative stuff which was always

470
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,930
on the slate Pixar's not changing with

471
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,220
that they're always gonna bring the

472
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,200
originals but I'm in the camp that says

473
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,570
let him do some sequels if they have

474
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:32,790
some good ideas and this one had some

475
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:35,790
good ideas in it but like Joe hit on in

476
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:38,850
the review the story was really weak and

477
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:40,920
it was because it was a repeat of the

478
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,200
fucking first story and you saw it

479
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,330
coming from a mile away and it was

480
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:47,610
really melodramatic stuff with the

481
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:50,160
parent the functions there and for me

482
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,520
like I had more tension about the boat

483
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,620
in the island than the whole flight with

484
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,690
the bad guys yeah in that crate there

485
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:01,380
was the baby you know wanted to just the

486
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,760
baby was mad they couldn't see his

487
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,130
mother's eyes you know when he found his

488
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:06,480
mother and she's being mind-controlled

489
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,700
and her father's mind control and every

490
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,460
was mind control Frozone and the babies

491
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,640
you know lips the balance does it's

492
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,290
fucking done it's a result the problem

493
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:19,170
and it's so easy to knock those glasses

494
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:21,210
off everybody you're like and this

495
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:22,860
villain was kind of laves you don't

496
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:31,320
really plan for that and her whole plan

497
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,660
was stupid anyway why do I get them to

498
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:36,450
sign make superheroes legal then do it

499
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:39,030
you could have just had superheroes come

500
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:41,190
out and done it at any time had some

501
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,720
girls come out and start attacking then

502
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,580
they're like we are definitely not

503
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,020
breaking or just do nothing

504
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:49,050
yeah they were already illegal her goal

505
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:50,220
was to make them illegal they were

506
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,970
already illegal just literally do not

507
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:55,620
let them be legally well I think maybe

508
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:58,560
it wasn't explained but you know she's

509
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,170
not able to stop her brother from doing

510
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:03,060
because her brother was doing great work

511
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,710
they're about to get it to fix so she's

512
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:07,080
like okay he's gonna get it passed so

513
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,990
I'll engage right when we're about this

514
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:10,960
to ruin every

515
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,770
me she was gonna be the yin to his yang

516
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:17,440
mean Daisy it's a kids movie that story

517
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,810
oh no it's not a kids movie this is for

518
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:21,940
adults because the kids were fucking

519
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:24,100
bored the own we had some kids in them

520
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,780
in the theater the only time I heard

521
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,550
them laughing or having a good time or

522
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:29,650
sort of emulating the film was when Jack

523
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:32,200
Jack was up on screen and everybody was

524
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,500
laughing everybody seen the raccoons it

525
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,150
has the best thing what will happen in

526
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:38,740
that one so basically Jack Jack is

527
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,750
watching TV late at night he sees his

528
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,930
burglar obviously he has a mask and he

529
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:48,400
looks at the window he sees a raccoon

530
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:53,680
with the bandit mask it's a villain yes

531
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,440
that was actually the best villain fight

532
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,290
in this film yes Jack Jack's fight with

533
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:01,660
the fucking raccoon is the bats villain

534
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:05,830
fight Wow and it was amazing the babies

535
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:10,000
using pop and this raccoon

536
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,550
there's the expressions we're so amazing

537
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:13,780
on the raccoon because the first

538
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:16,510
directors little baby beat this baby up

539
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:18,280
and then they're fighting he's getting

540
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,570
his ass kicked and then he sees all the

541
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:22,420
powers knowing God fuck this but then he

542
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,610
gets mad and he's still fighting and

543
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:26,800
he's still coming back and by the end of

544
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,260
raccoon is still staring down the baby

545
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:31,330
at the end he comes he comes out he goes

546
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:33,880
back later but the baby falls asleep I

547
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,500
just want to see a whole fucking movie

548
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,810
of that

549
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:41,020
yes I cannot wait in fact on my end this

550
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:44,230
early so I can go watch Jack Jack attack

551
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:46,390
guys thank you so much for watching and

552
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:48,910
we will see you on the next angry Joe

553
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:52,870
show like it's for Pixar this is like

554
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:54,700
sorry I think their average is way

555
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,740
higher than not anymore the Golden Age

556
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,630
of Pixar's over and you agree with that

557
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:01,030
I do but that doesn't discount that the

558
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:03,430
catalog from the Golden Age doesn't go

559
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:05,800
away it's still part waiting the average

560
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,930
towards the higher amount so it's still

561
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:09,940
very much there the average Pixar films

562
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:12,430
probably an eight again and so this one

563
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:14,230
is definitely below that I'd say the

564
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:16,630
average Golden Age Pixar is definitely a

565
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:18,540
nine oh yeah that's why it's the but if

566
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:21,450
factor everything in a price for worship

567
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:24,390
below but have that for this building

568
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:27,810
that but yes it's as a kid probably five

569
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:32,940
as a kids mill maybe kids I like it even

570
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:36,020
though whenever they arrested that chick

571
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:39,180
like wall she's read so she just gets

572
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,890
Lebanon she'll be out yeah so that's

573
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:44,580
another thing the village is gonna get

574
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,650
out and the brother didn't say no I'm

575
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:48,480
gonna make sure she stays in prison

576
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,920

578
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,420
