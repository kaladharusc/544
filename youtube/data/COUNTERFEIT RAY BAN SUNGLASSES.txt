00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:27,960
situation it's like a huge deal Bert is

5
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,369
sort of a big deal it we have a

6
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:35,050
situation

[Music]

8
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,600
quick eight miles I gotta go deal with

9
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:46,320
the situation you see the video I put

10
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,420
out like two days ago about the flooding

11
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,390
in Houston and hurricane Harvey the one

12
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:54,360
that had Candace's dad my father-in-law

13
00:00:54,360 --> 00:01:01,920
in it that's super important context

14
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,719
super important context because in that

15
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:06,540
video you see Candace my wife her dad

16
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,590
Stanley

17
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:08,939
explained how he was trapped in his

18
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:10,710
house in Texas during the floods he had

19
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:11,939
to climb through the roof and he shows

20
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:13,290
his leg and it's all bruised he

21
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,060
literally lost his home due to a flood

22
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,619
it's been kind of a rough week for

23
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:18,210
Stanley all right so here's the

24
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:19,020
situation

25
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,740
Stanley turned 70 it's his 70th birthday

26
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,420
this week now all the same wanted for

27
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,520
his birthday was to go on a family trip

28
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,280
with his with his daughters and his two

29
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,619
grandchildren the trip has been planned

30
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:33,450
for the better part of the last nine

31
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:34,170
months

32
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,119
and the trip the family trip this is his

33
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:38,759
idea is to go on a cruise a cruise ship

34
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:41,460
a cruise boat that's a Disney cruise

35
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,320
boat you know like Mickey Mouse and

36
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,790
Donald Duck and all that and that

37
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,610
cruises you to leave in two days from

38
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:49,530
Florida all right category five

39
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:52,290
hurricane winds still 185 miles an hour

40
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:53,880
on top of that Francine's been so

41
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,290
excited and we bought her all the

42
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,450
stuffed animals and shoes and flip-flops

43
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,329
and all that stuff just for this trip

44
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:02,850
that's now maybe going to be canceled so

45
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,170
the vlogs of this week are gonna be

46
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,180
entirely dedicated to whether or not we

47
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,520
go on that trip

48
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:16,550
[Music]

49
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,750
remember my sunglasses that had the

50
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:22,530
purple lenses these ones those glasses

51
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:25,050
well I lost them swimming in the ocean

52
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,760
at my friend's birthday party

53
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,920
I really missed them so I ordered

54
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,280
another pair off of Amazon they came

55
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,170
this week but I think they're

56
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:47,430
counterfeit here's where things get

57
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:52,440
fishy the texture of these does not feel

58
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,930
right on top of that they feel a little

59
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:57,840
too flexible and this shade of purple

60
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,940
seems a little darker than how I

61
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:00,750
remember it

62
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01,920
so what I don't think these

63
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,540
counterfeiters realize is that they're

64
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,950
selling these glasses to someone who

65
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:07,380
literally lives in a pair of Raven

66
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:10,410
glasses and I can tell when they feel

67
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:13,709
different and these feel different I

68
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:15,900
don't think they're legit now I did

69
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,790
weigh them against my other glasses and

70
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:22,500
they check out exactly 35 grams and when

71
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,239
I check all the details like the

72
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,150
Markel's they're the etching into the

73
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:30,840
the logo on the side and even the text

74
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,230
on the inside of the arm that that all

75
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:37,350
checks out but I I can't place it they

76
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,270
just don't feel right

77
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:41,700
also the receipt that came with it said

78
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,830
if there's any problem with this package

79
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:46,770
don't contact Amazon contact us directly

80
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:50,560
it seemed a little Shady

81
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,130
fashion shoot

82
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:57,750
behind me here this is the official

83
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,989
raven's Soho flagship store I'm hoping I

84
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:03,599
can get to the bottom of this suspected

85
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,260
counterfeit inside the store here this

86
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,209
is not an advertisement for a band at

87
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:11,700
all in fact I'm not a fan of Ray Ban the

88
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,620
brand that's why I scratch their labels

89
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,079
off of all my sunglasses but they are

90
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,549
the ones who make these glasses so it

91
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:19,019
always seems appropriate

92
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:23,820
what's up man my name is Dmytro dot no

93
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,220
limit on that

94
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,530
I'll just go man's on 150 Instagram cat

95
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,690
under school camisa you can count on me

96
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:33,650
gentlemen you can count on me no purple

97
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,850
okay I've got a question for it

98
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:39,330
I bought these on the internet I think

99
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:41,220
they're bullsh I think that these are

100
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,440
counterfeits I think they're really good

101
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,520
counterfeits but I think they're

102
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,300
counterfeit I did that look good we go

103
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,120
by the fonts on the inside so one thing

104
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,140
I'm so sorry we can't do like

105
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:58,420
all right so they're convinced these

106
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,760
glasses are legit but they didn't do a

107
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,220
very thorough inspection and honestly I

108
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,100
still think they're bogus so this

109
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,440
segment the counterfeit glass segment

110
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,060
will happy to be continued I need to

111
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:26,080
find a real expert on Raven it's the new

112
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,040
videomic pro from road they used to only

113
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,290
use this microphone but I got frustrated

114
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,330
with her or something I stopped usually

115
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:36,190
this is the new one they're supposed to

116
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:38,560
fix all the short company okay ready

117
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,150
tell me if this sounds any different

118
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:43,440
you're now listening to the old mic and

119
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,450
you're now listening to the new mic how

120
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:49,990
does it sound better more clear this is

121
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,430
what the old mic look like this is also

122
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:53,050
rode mic I like this microphone I like

123
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:54,580
the shock mount look I broke it and had

124
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,500
to tape it but I do like this doesn't

125
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,680
take any batteries expect a full

126

128

are we or are we not going on the 70th

129
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,780
birthday family vacation that this week

130
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,210
but have they said if our cruise ships

131
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:15,420
canceled which is really step like what

132
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,160
if people need to get medications for

133
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,260
more than five days honey and you do

134
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,180
best assessment are these counterfeit

135
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,940
yes I they're kind of tight um to the

136
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:24,990
store and they said they're not

137
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,940
counterfeit they just look really cheap

138
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:38,160
right so what's the verdict fake okay

139
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,230
all right well thank you so much for

140
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:42,120
letting us know so we just wait to hear

141
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:50,400
from the travel agent or what happened

142
00:06:50,400 --> 00:07:04,380
Disney Cruise canceled no so I do just

143
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:08,670
want to say since since I recorded this

144
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:11,340
vlog episode it's like two days ago that

145
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,690
hurricane hurricane

146
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:15,750
Irma has has hit land on a couple of

147
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,910
islands in Puerto Rico and it looks like

148
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:20,400
it's headed for Florida and it is proven

149
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,380
to be like an absolutely devastating

150
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:27,360
devastating storm so my stupid vacation

151
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,220
to go see Mickey Mouse doesn't really

152
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:32,310
matter but lots of thoughts and and

153
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:35,640
really just best wishes for anyone and

154
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,100
everyone who's in the trajectory of this

155
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,190
storm and is being affected by this

156
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:46,000
like deadly truly terrifying storm
