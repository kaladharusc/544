4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,230
summer like non-stop when romp hymns

5
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,349

10
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,510
elegant Rob him when I was looking

11
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,610
online at pictures of romp hims they're

12
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,920
all like the same shape and everything

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,090
about them is the same it's like a

14
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,129
button-down shirt with like built-in

15
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:43,770
shorts that's a one-piece it's so boring

16
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:45,870
like I don't understand who says a man

17
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,239
can't enjoy a beautiful flowy fabric in

18
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,699
a flowy shape that allows you to enjoy

19
00:00:50,699 --> 00:00:53,219
the warm weather with freedom who says

20
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:56,070
that nobody so I want to make Julian a

21
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:59,370
really nice flowy romper so I took him

22
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:00,899
to the fabric store and I had him pick

23
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:03,510
out fabric and this is what he chose

24
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,640
I'll do the chroma key poster now an

25
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,810
invisible okay

26
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,140
they've lemonade here

27
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:12,470
Trask I think something like this looks

28
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:20,720
like a flower this is a fantasy this one

29
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,540
is my guy no this would be hot I sweat

30
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,670
all over it this reminds me of Beauty

31
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:33,350
and the Beast this is actually really

32
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:34,970
nice I think that is really pretty on

33
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:45,700
you I'm feeling I'm feeling the fabric

34
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:50,690
give it to me give it to me you're

35
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:53,450
pissing the stalks off I just existing

36
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:55,369
I'm trying to figure out in my mind if

37
00:01:55,369 --> 00:01:57,800
this is big enough because I kind of

38
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,540
just want to make two pieces and slap

39
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,950
them together I've made a couple of

40
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,570
sewing videos in the past I'm not like

41
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:05,030
good at sewing like please don't take

42
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,500
any instruction for me unless you want

43
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,570
to make stuff that's not quite right

44
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:10,759
like me I don't know how to sew I just

45
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:12,620
refuse to fail okay this is the very

46
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:15,049
professional way how to do stuff the

47
00:02:15,049 --> 00:02:17,630
best way to do this is to get your man

48
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:21,170
to just lay down on this where my feet

49
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:25,010

78
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:13,670
down to there I mean what's your part of

79
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:19,820
the Shh all right are you ready to try

80
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,850
this on so I can make some alterations

81
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:25,190
yes B and cut it more it doesn't have a

82
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:27,260
zipper oh wait you can't put it on cuz

83
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:31,070
it doesn't have a zipper whoops I sewed

84
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:34,669
it all together but I forgot that once

85
00:04:34,669 --> 00:04:37,970
you do that Julianne can't get in it so

86
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:40,070
I'll just try and figure out a place

87
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:42,350
that seems relatively central and hope

88
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:44,930
that that that's where it should go cuz

89
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:48,050
I fucked up zipper foot I don't have a

90
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:50,360
zipper foot I'm just gonna sew it I

91
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,980
guess I don't even really know how to

92
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,990
put in a zipper please don't yell at me

93
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,550
in the comments I really don't know how

94
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,530
to sew I'm just doing my best

95
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,660
yes do you know the zipper is the

96
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,820
largest organ in the body and it has the

97
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,370
most teeth and bones and if you find a

98
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,560
zipper in the wild if it might be

99
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,479
poisonous or what if before I put the

100
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,460
zipper in you try it now that I've cut

101
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:14,750
it open it might be a little tight okay

102
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,030
yeah you want it tight I prefer to oh

103
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:19,970
boy well the back is pretty messed up

104
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:22,010
because I just cut it down on it you

105
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:24,200
just stabbed me no I didn't yeah I'm

106
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,720
just feeding it I was stabbed I feel

107
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,250
like this is the wrong way to do this

108
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,500
upper I feel defeated and

109
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,750
don't feel defeated you can do this okay

110
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,190
what do you want you want the shorts

111
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,720
shorter what do you mean there's a lot

112
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,520
of space I like it it's you want to be

113
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,200
like up more do I maintain my shape you

114
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,140
do a fun activity okay you can cut all

115
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,600
this excess everything outside of the

116
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,220
stitch cut off so right down the middle

117
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,470
yes and then cut your shorts how you

118
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:52,910
like them I've never done this before

119
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:54,860
I'm very nervous what do you think she

120
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,330
would do if I just cut right down the

121
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:57,830
middle of the whole thing do you think

122
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:00,650
she would like uh nanniversary today I

123
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:03,380
accidently cut a hole in it I have a new

124
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,750
plan what is it I'm gonna cut off the

125
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,820
whole top and we're gonna make overalls

126
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:11,420
I just like it I hate it I hate it and I

127
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,760
can't fucking so that zipper in so I'm

128
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,800
just gonna cut like where the armhole is

129
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,550
across and then give you straps bold

130
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:22,610
daring I say so no greatness was ever

131
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:25,490
achieved without risk or incredible

132
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:28,490
error so now I've eliminated the need

133
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:32,510
for a zipper what why you laughing I'm

134
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:32,930
good

135
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:35,330
what do you provocative it makes you

136
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:41,750
like an ass memo for your ass you want

137
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,880
some thick straps right for support

138
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,430
thick with four and a half C's I'm not

139
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,320
gonna finish any of the edges that's way

140
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,450
too much work no I like the rugged look

141
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:53,450
