00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,960
know how to fly this thing there we go

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,489
in earnest now so we've got green blue

11
00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:36,390
and orange resources there's the series

12
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:43,590
training base scanning captain we've

13
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,270
located the source of the radio signal

14
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,710
it looks like there's a crashed ship

15
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:47,340
down there

16
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,110
whoa we should take a lander down to

17
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:55,290
investigate

18
00:00:55,290 --> 00:01:03,650

23
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,860
change from the usual disgust and

00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,170
contempt we receive when co-captain

25
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:26,910

said it was in our solar system right I

34
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:54,420

38
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,650
did that find time ones missing ship

39
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:10,430

55
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,620
up we already went to those two right

56
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:57,660
past is fast but not that fast it would

57
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,370
take us thousands of years to reach the

58
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:06,390
new we have that kind of time like that

59
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,980
what is your sense of adventure you only

60
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:13,620
went to Neptune unidentified object this

61
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:19,740
is not a blue planet

62
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:23,070
I've got the square on my radar

63
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:28,450
approaching the object now that does not

64
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:31,920
look like the other half of their ship

65
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,070
looks like a bomb

66
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:39,940
touch it it's Russian looks like an old

67
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:49,960

00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:57,550
we're detecting an unidentified object

72
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,740
on the surface we may want to send a

73
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:03,210
lander down to investigate

74
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:07,050
you think this is blue you piece of shit

75
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:13,800

86
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,750
solar system so yeah

87
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,189

109
00:07:05,099 --> 00:07:06,599
of the galaxy to leave the Sol system

110
00:07:06,599 --> 00:07:15,590
they said

111
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:20,400
the navigational system oh whoa fire I

112
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,479
don't have any weapons on this remember

113

Ram it

114
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:33,360
thrusters dam graphic speed did nothing

115
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:40,120
but first there's a technology found a

116
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,370
wrecked ship captain we'll see if we can

117
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:44,319
get this thing flying again well we got

118
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,780
a whole brand new ship these blue

119

00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:52,180
I got him though drone release he's ran

133
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:57,880
into the history my god him Wow

134
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,530
these ships are good they can put your

135

own drones you see him what what is this

136
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:17,910

stay near it I'm trying to avoid getting

142
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,860
hit dropping drone trying to use our

143
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:48,120
advantage that's a good idea

144
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,250
yes all right

145
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,379
there's tactics there's strategy in

146
00:09:53,379 --> 00:09:55,569
these simplistic battles they are simply

147
00:09:55,569 --> 00:09:57,670
running low on fuel though this guy

148
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,290
looks like he's coming to intercept go

149
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:00,399

00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:11,800
prepare to be destroyed all right Joe

153
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,990
we're about to lose our right use that

154
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:16,480

another one and another one you ran into

158
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:48,260
it I might end here guys where the base

159
00:10:48,260 --> 00:11:03,350
okay so the point defense is just a

160
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:10,020
they have to get close enough

161
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:18,660
Oh taking too much damage

162
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:25,870
shit I cannot fire

163
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:28,520

00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:57,700
down so hard doing all right up until

168
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:04,430
that ramp your other weapon by the way

169
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:06,740
the other but but it's gonna use the

170
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:10,190
same energy oh my god

171
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:12,529
holy shit gonna get the next one and

172
00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:14,839
I'll beat a month next one I was coming

173
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:21,980
very very close

174
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:53,710
that's too far

175
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:58,250
the fine lucky Joe can't fucking do it

176
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:01,220
you know you didn't do it no idea what

177
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:15,040
is that perfect shot a little bit faster

178
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:25,259
yeah we have to take one more

179
00:13:25,259 --> 00:13:36,339
one on wine who gets a shot so that's it

180
00:13:36,339 --> 00:13:38,139
for star control me and Joe's wacky

181
00:13:38,139 --> 00:13:41,230
adventure in the galaxy check it out if

182
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:43,149
you're interested in sci-fi games

183
00:13:43,149 --> 00:13:45,610
exploration games I think its strength

184
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:47,680
is the you know sort of wacky and funny

185
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,899
dialogue from all the races meeting new

186
00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:52,180
interesting looking aliens I always like

187
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,970
to view screen finder stuff I look at it

188
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:56,800
but kind of like a mini game you you

189
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,910
remember a Mass Effect where you're

190
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:59,649
driving around and I was always asking

191
00:13:59,649 --> 00:14:01,660
somebody to populate that with ships and

192
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,130
then you go into these little mini

193
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:05,350
battles this is basically that fleshed

194
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:07,480
out but none of the other stuff around

195
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,029
it so it can be kind of limiting it's a

196
00:14:10,029 --> 00:14:11,800
little faithful to the original maybe a

197
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,079
little too faithful I hope it I wish

198
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,509
there may be a little bit more injected

199
00:14:16,509 --> 00:14:19,569
in there for 2018 but it's fun for what

200
00:14:19,569 --> 00:14:20,889
it is I looking at it sort of like a

201
00:14:20,889 --> 00:14:22,720
chill kind of game it's getting a lot of

202
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,060
comparisons obviously to no man's sky

203
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,949
and it does have that little bit of

204
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:29,410
repetitiveness I'm told by dealt elves

205
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,240
put in a lot more hours in than I have

206
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,440
he says it gets a little repetitive

207
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,690
towards the end but from what me and Joe

208
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:36,490
played we really enjoyed our time with

209
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:39,220
it especially you know those little

210
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,980
fleet battles and trying to squeeze out

211
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,470
as much from your ship as you can so

212
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:46,959
