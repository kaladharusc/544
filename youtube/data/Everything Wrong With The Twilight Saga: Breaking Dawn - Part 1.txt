3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,099
fascination with splitting up movie

4
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:15,839
adaptations of final novels in a series

5
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,970
goddammit childhood is not from birth to

6
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:19,740

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,119

18
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,600
happened in that last movie again oh god

19
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,160

21

23
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,430
way to get married we'll be perfect

24
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:48,629
we'll be cuts from invited guests

25
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:49,920
receiving invitations straight to the

26
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,539
wedding day like that isn't done five

27
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:54,930
months ahead of time character in the

28
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,460
movie openly mocks all the directors who

29
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,199
took on Twilight films ello curry it's

30
00:00:58,199 --> 00:00:59,760
bad luck by seeing the director of Snow

31
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,840
White in the huntsmen before the wedding

32
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,699
wedding Eve and Bella still has a huge

33
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:04,860
lamp problem one year turned on one here

34
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,540
turned off a string on the wall turned

35
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,040
off then we cut to this shot to see one

36
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,479
lamp on and an entire string of lights

37
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:11,159
on as well what is this girl's issue

38
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:16,229
with light sources this and checking

39
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:19,020
somewhere outside my own shoes vampire

40
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,820
puns also Edwards vampy sense is

41
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,799
tingling his skin is twinkling and I

42
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:23,939
think I'm gonna head to the bathroom for

43
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:25,950
a little tinkling so for a while I went

44
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,689
off on my own I wanted to know how it

45
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:29,159
felt to hunt so I was definitely

46
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:30,360
watching the Bride of Frankenstein

47
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,740
because that's a popular horror movie

48
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:32,759
that makes sense for the Twilight

49
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,229
narrative I definitely didn't watch a

50
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:35,880
night at the Opera over the 39 steps

51
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,770
because the Marx Brothers and Hitchcock

52
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:39,659
also Edward waits until literally the

53
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:40,710
night before the wedding to tell his

54
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,180
bride whatever scandal his story this is

55
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,470
I've already stopped paying attention to

56
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,899
it also wasn't Edward changed in 1918 so

57
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:47,549
he decided to rebel from Carlyle after

58
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:49,740
17 years as a vampire or did the

59
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:50,790
filmmakers just want to use Bride of

60
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,619
Frankenstein so bad they didn't get no

61
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:54,000
theatre staff appears to be working

62
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,979
today in 1935 those were the days when

63
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:57,360
everything pretty much ran it's up other

64
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,850
than that I come monsters Looby

65
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,140
justifies all the killing Edward has

66
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,670
ever done by delivering the caveat that

67
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,079
they all deserve to die god forbid he

68
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,280
killed any innocent people to make his

69
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,299
character just the slightest bit

70
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:08,129
interested also Dexter Edward is way

71
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:09,300
better story than Twilight

72
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,830
but is given 30 seconds of time while

73
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,360
the rest of it is approximately 10 hours

74
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,290
buttons

75
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:15,900
raisa stay tied nice so who I was you've

76
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,159
been through so much as a couple that I

77
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:18,450
can't believe this story was withheld

78
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,099
until now unless it's just because there

79
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:21,450
needed to be some new revelation in the

80
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:22,859
fourth Twilight to alleviate writer's

81
00:02:22,859 --> 00:02:23,219
block

82
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:25,680
II know I can do this what be a vampire

83
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,200
can't anyone do that what does this

84
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,620
sentence even mean Jesus skipped vampire

85
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,150
hijinks editor accidentally cuts

86
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,439
American Beauty into this movie in

87
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:36,090
Bella's dream pre wedding her father was

88
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,560
a mere guest rather than walking her up

89
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,700
the aisle or giving her away at the

90
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,139
altar

91
00:02:39,139 --> 00:02:41,370
Breaking Dawn Part 1 is like the seventh

92
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,840
season of a TV show that used to rule

93
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,549
the ratings but started to decline so

94
00:02:44,549 --> 00:02:45,599
they plan a wedding episode despite

95
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,939
ratings for sweeps week and something

96
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:51,930
old besides your brother and now I get

97
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,280
to see why they divorce before the first

98
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,260
movie even came out fun Edward and Bella

99
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,700
somehow managed to book the super

100
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,439
popular wedding spot wooded area of a

101
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:00,060
million hanging angelic white flowers

102
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,680
and beautifulness where it has it they

103
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,939
were competing with Mark Zuckerberg for

104
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:04,319
this booking and one out at the last

105
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,730
second when he decided to just have his

106
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:07,109
own forest planet he thought I was gonna

107
00:03:07,109 --> 00:03:09,780
be showing just she is not pregnant

108
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,810
okay who else gets married at 18 Anna

109
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:14,099
Kendrick is all the following things

110
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:16,109
here in the scene hot correct

111
00:03:16,109 --> 00:03:18,209
inappropriate judgmental selfish and hot

112
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:20,310
ready well either the entire audience

113
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,659
can hear them from that distance or else

114
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:22,859
this wedding ceremony somehow gave a

115
00:03:22,859 --> 00:03:24,659
silent cue to attendees to stand for the

116
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:26,280
imminent bride arrival also it then

117
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,840
takes two minutes of actual film time to

118
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,280
show Bella walk down the aisle just

119
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,010
don't never accept any of the previous

120
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:33,329
sixteen years of your life when I was a

121
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:34,829
total deadbeat alcoholic distant father

122
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:36,299
fellas dress is such that it makes the

123
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,409
high heeled training earlier in the

124
00:03:37,409 --> 00:03:38,819
movie even dumber because nobody could

125
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:40,650
even see that anyway why is mom seated

126
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:42,299
right next to her ex-husband where's the

127
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:43,590
minor league baseball boyfriend from the

128
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,180
first movie damn I was just starting to

129
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,180
like that guy they choose much like real

130
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,620
weddings I wish I hadn't been invited to

131
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,699
this it was at this point in the

132
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:52,229
ceremony that Rupert Sanders stood up

133
00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:53,819
and said I have nothing to declare right

134
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:55,560
now but I think many of you may find me

135
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,669
reprehensible a year from now

136
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:57,810
movie cut out the part where every

137
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,220
single wedding guest had an objection to

138
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,569
this Union a scene which was probably

139
00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:02,159
amazing but was cut out strictly for

140
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,540
that reason Edwin Miller's wedding kiss

141
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,919
lasts the whole goddamn day also

142
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:06,689
seriously a standing ovation for the

143
00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:08,010
18-year old getting married to the guy

144
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:09,720
most people here think is 17 but it's

145
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,909
actually 110 well I plan on giving girl

146
00:04:11,909 --> 00:04:13,739
well I am not surprised to hear you say

147
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:15,090
that dad who always has a beer in his

148
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,560
hand anyway thank you grace isn't in

149
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,000
some convoluted plot involving being

150
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,859
taken in the scene 90 seconds of mostly

151
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:22,229
inappropriate toasts montage Jacob how

152
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:23,550
the fuck you know who that is a shirt

153
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:24,840
wearing distance yes

154
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,610
your alternate lover just outside the

155
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:27,900
reception of your wedding to a dude I

156
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,550
fucking hate also it's part one of a

157
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:31,110
popular book series adaptation so of

158
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,520
course time to make time for best

159
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,680
friends dancing to do that and to latex

160
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,960
to me clothes

161
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,979
this is exactly what my college

162
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:38,970
girlfriend said to me after a

163
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:42,419
particularly real crying in formalwear

164
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:44,070
and promising yourself forever to my

165
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:44,729
sworn enemy

166
00:04:44,729 --> 00:04:46,800
yeah this is a utopian image right here

167
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,960
didn't really want to spend my honeymoon

168
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,610
writhing in pain who says you have to

169
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:52,020
honeymoon directly after the wedding I

170
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,550
can't get changed into a vampire and

171
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:54,750
then have the honeymoon after you've

172
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,460
calmed down the power of lady boners

173
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,930
causes the stupidest plot development

174
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:58,889
ever and we're gonna have to suffer

175
00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:00,840
through two movies because of it no you

176
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,800
can't do this

177
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,270
the emotional control of these assholes

178
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,280
is hepatitis C for the plot this easily

179
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,389
could have been a calm discussion about

180
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:07,650
how vampire boning could kill her and

181
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:09,060
the supernatural world would flip it

182
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,040
instead Jacob can't control his wolf

183
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,479
temper it's been four minutes since I've

184
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,889
written to sin about this movie I think

185
00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:15,240
it's either because I fell asleep or

186
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,410
nothing happened in those four minutes

187
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:18,060
anyway I think I'll just add a soon

188
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:18,870
because this movie is definitely

189
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,390
representative of sloth

190
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:23,720
[Music]

191
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,910
oh shut your fucking whining Jacob

192
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,650
vampire movie just can't resist stomping

193
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:28,970
a bit more on the religious folk among

194
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,440
us all so I guess the metaphor here is

195
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,180
that Bella is Jesus sacrificing her

196
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,310
virginity for the sake of wait and if

197
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,510
thirty minutes of waiting weren't enough

198
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,860
how about thirty minutes of a honeymoon

199
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,960
that's exciting right with this movie

200
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,670
being pg-13 I bet the sex will be more

201
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:42,110
amazing than anything we saw on Finding

202
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,640
Nemo this newlywed bride didn't shave

203
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,080
her legs until arriving at the honeymoon

204
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,760
suite and hey I'm all for women doing

205
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,780
whatever they want with their leg hair

206
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,220
but she clearly thinks shaved it's the

207
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,600
way to go so I'm sending her for waiting

208
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,010
until now to do something about her leg

209
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:53,510
hair situation she got married with

210
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,010
stubble the sex is not more amazing than

211
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:56,600
anything we saw on Finding Nemo also

212
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,160
vampire human sexual attention waits

213
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,600
until the fourth goddamn movie to even

214
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,990
remotely relieve said sexual tension

215
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:04,190
yeah well you should see what her vagina

216
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:06,740
looks like I can't tell you how sorry um

217
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,330
didn't you already know what the risks

218
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:09,920
of vampire human coitus was going to be

219
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,840
before you acted upon said coitus I mean

220
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,400
is this even an issue this seems like

221
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,080
made up both to make the movie longer I

222
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,780
know it's not the same for you for a

223
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,660
human I can't imagine it gets any better

224
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,580
than said the girl who just had sex for

225
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,230
the first time also I'm not buying that

226
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,640
the ferocious vampire sex was so

227
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,050
mind-blowing to this virgin that she was

228
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:28,430
able to see past the pain and somehow

229
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,410
had fifty orgasms honeymoon let's play

230
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:32,510
chess I mean right no one will be seated

231
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:34,010
during the Bella and Edward play chess a

232
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:35,960
second time seat la la third time

233
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,790
blahblah chess is either gonna kill her

234
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:40,630
or change her and the Treaty says I say

235
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,650
Jacob any guy's not had this

236
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:44,150
conversation already where's it's just

237
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,470
some bull repeated argument you've been

238
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:47,150
having for several months now if Jacob

239
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,169
would just go find a girlfriend I don't

240
00:06:48,169 --> 00:06:49,580
think this would be a problem did you

241
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,479
just get over it

242
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,370
it's not like you've imprinted on her

243
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,810
Jesus you kiss your mother with that

244
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:55,490
mouth okay props to Bella for being

245
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:56,900
imaginative with what she has on hand

246
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,520
but she is currently doing some kind of

247
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,260
cooking with restaurant takeout chicken

248
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,150
pieces peanut butter and yogurt in other

249
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:03,350
words what the fuck if she thinks she's

250
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:05,090
making obvious Salmonella catches a huge

251
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:06,229
break and hides behind Bella's

252
00:07:06,229 --> 00:07:07,940
coincidental morning sickness is this

253
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:08,690
even possible

254
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:10,669
is this a serious question what if

255
00:07:10,669 --> 00:07:12,290
Carlisle says no I sure I'm glad they

256
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:13,760
decided to show the exciting packing

257
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,530
scene with Edward doing his vampire it

258
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:16,940
sure beats not seeing a packing scene at

259
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,169
all and just going straight to the colon

260
00:07:18,169 --> 00:07:19,250
house so we can figure out if Ella

261
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,660
really is pregnant right now we'd be

262
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,950
lost without this packing scene I tell

263
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,180
you thankfully for everyone in this

264
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,800
story this honeymoon island housekeeper

265
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,060
knows just enough legend to come in

266
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,740
handy during the human vampire pregnancy

267
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:28,669
no one thought was possible

268
00:07:28,669 --> 00:07:30,169
Dovie continues to have a fantastic

269
00:07:30,169 --> 00:07:31,190
sense of humor in the face of a

270
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:33,380
ridiculous plot sure

271
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,720
- easy what the this movie doesn't get

272
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,040
two sheets if I have any idea what's

273
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,050
taking place went I can't see it either

274
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:41,540
and I can't see Bella's future anymore

275
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,010
well that's convenient and applaud sense

276
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:44,630
even if it's inconvenient in a character

277
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,060
sense the fetus isn't good for Bella

278
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:51,530
save the word Alice baby it's just a

279
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:53,180
little baby abortion debate somehow

280
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,920
makes its way into part four of vampire

281
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,750
movie series an hour into this fucking

282
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,130
movie and we've had a wedding a sudden

283
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:59,660
pregnancy and now some wolf vampire

284
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:00,110
attention

285
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:02,360
that's an hour I'll never get back no I

286
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,980
can't figure out why he thinks you'd

287
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:06,080
listen to me you never have before

288
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,120
because you have constantly tried to get

289
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,500
in her pants and everything you've said

290
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,090
has directed her toward that goal and

291
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,740
even when you're being serious you flare

292
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,030
up in the wolf mode so fast that you

293
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,020
can't get a damn thought out without

294
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,190
being jacked towards from the shining

295
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:18,680
and when you die what was the point of

296
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,010
me loving you you loving him how was

297
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:23,630
that right for anyone first off it

298
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,280
wasn't right for anyone especially the

299
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,020
audience even if she lives asshole

300
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,250
second off who cares what her death

301
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,810
means to the love triangle it's like me

302
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,400
saying what was my purpose on earth if

303
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,539
the sun's going to blow up in four

304
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:35,030
billion years and this bike I'm wolf it

305
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,710
at home also time to wolf out and run

306
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:37,849
through the woods and review everything

307
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:39,169
that I've heard about Bella's condition

308
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:40,700
so far sometimes a good wolfing can

309
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,260
clear out your mind with this exercise I

310
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,580
once stumbled on a really good pasta

311
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:44,900
recipe so this should definitely figure

312
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:49,580
out Bella's vampire kid problem

313
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,380
so what we're all the members of Jacob

314
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,880
strong I'm currently in their wolf form

315
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,140
when they heard him howling were they

316
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,550
just kicking back me and wolfy just in

317
00:08:55,550 --> 00:09:01,100
case someone gave him a call Jacob's

318
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,420
howl tell them all they needed to know

319
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,100
about the vampire kid and why did Jacob

320
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,240
tell them anything about it if he knew

321
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,560
the other wolves would be pissed and

322
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,000
want to kill Bella I mean even if he

323
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,350
thinks they'll only want the kid she

324
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,910
might be dead giving birth to it so what

325
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:16,640
was his endgame here you mean her choice

326
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,140
to get bring it on accident or her

327
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,940
choice to keep the baby this movie

328
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,230
really wants to talk about abortion does

329
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,640
it also I know there are a lot of people

330
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,020
out there who love Twilight we're not

331
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,550
gonna judge but you've gotta admit the

332
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:26,360
scene where the won't speak

333
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,680
telepathically in English to each other

334
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,820
is one of the stupidest things ever

335
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:34,400
committed to film I guess this means

336
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,320
something does that mean something will

337
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,340
someone please explain to me if that

338
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,660
means something okay no there's still

339
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,730
like six or so wolves here who do follow

340
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,680
Sam so can't they just tackle Jacob and

341
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,570
put him in wolf prison then plan their

342
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:46,190
attack why are they allowing this

343
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:47,810
because he yelled Jacob is rebelling

344
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:49,220
against his tribe and running into the

345
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,290
woods toward some unknown goal but still

346
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,430
took the time to get a proper human

347
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:54,320
shirt and pants for some reason ready

348
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,670
why did Jacob and Edward bother with

349
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:57,050
this weird long-distance supernatural

350
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:58,490
talk instead of just inviting him back

351
00:09:58,490 --> 00:09:59,990
in was some other stupid power they

352
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,580
wanted to show off hey guys we can talk

353
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,740
normally at great distances Sam send you

354
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:06,440
Sam doesn't even know I left I was that

355
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,130
even possible

356
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:08,690
I think you just figured it out

357
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:11,060
seriously just now being unwanted isn't

358
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:13,280
exactly a new Saint sorry Ruby expects

359
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,570
me to remember some sort of backstory

360
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:15,740
about this character that was briefly

361
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,030
mentioned in the first movie and she

362
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,410
wasn't even introduced on screen until

363
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,970
the last movie and looking back at our

364
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:21,110
sins from that movie we didn't even

365
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:24,040
really know who she was then either so

366
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,890
Yahoo of course even though no one knows

367
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:29,180
what the hell is going on the Internet

368
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,500
is your one click stop to learn about

369
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,240
all that in one sitting these movies get

370
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,560
more and more annoying as they go along

371
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,210
but damned if I don't still really covet

372
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:39,290
that house Jesus Brad actually you are

373
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:40,850
the very definition of someone who can

374
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,110
live without it do you honestly think

375
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:45,830
that I could love it or even tolerated

376
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:48,410
Figg killed Wow Edward is the worst

377
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:48,950
father ever

378
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,840
and this kid isn't even born yet okay we

379
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,520
get it she looks awful make a decision

380
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,870
already why can't they just go ahead and

381
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:55,220
somehow c-section this baby out of her

382
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,720
at this point the baby is clearly so

383
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,740
strong it doesn't need to follow a

384
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,630
normal pregnancy protocol so why does

385
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:00,590
she feel like she needs to carry this

386
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:02,360
demon spawn to turn plus this watching

387
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,410
the USC Washington game

388
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:05,569
in 2011 when it extra didn't matter I

389
00:11:05,569 --> 00:11:08,810
could only see the fetus baby maybe I

390
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:11,750
could figure out what it wants Jesus are

391
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:12,470
you serious

392
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:15,589
it wants out Simone negative latest -

393
00:11:15,589 --> 00:11:17,000
Bella why didn't you try to do this

394
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,769
before why have you been sitting on this

395
00:11:18,769 --> 00:11:20,120
until she looked like the zombie

396
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,709
apocalypse to finally suggest the idea

397
00:11:21,709 --> 00:11:24,170
we put the blood in the Styrofoam cup of

398
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:26,810
the straw I'm seriously not able to stop

399
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:30,110
laughing about this taste oh my god the

400
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:32,329
suspense does taste bad or good I'm on

401
00:11:32,329 --> 00:11:33,620
pins and tide

402
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:38,750
ah that's better yeah of course you are

403
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,160
the past 30 minutes of this movie had

404
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,930
been a thousand laps thought he was like

405
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:46,339
me but he Scotty's like you good pure

406
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:48,980
good and pure that's not like either of

407
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:52,069
you who loves you both and you also not

408
00:11:52,069 --> 00:11:53,540
figure out that this he is a girl yet

409
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:56,199
since she's telling you everything else

410
00:11:56,199 --> 00:11:58,550
so it's the last of it I realize they

411
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:59,660
didn't plan for a sudden vampire

412
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,310
pregnancy but Jesus they only had a few

413
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:02,959
days worth of blood on hand Carlyle

414
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,990
you're that enemy now Sam won't hesitate

415
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:07,579
you will be slaughtered

416
00:12:07,579 --> 00:12:09,230
Jacob is so certain that Carlisle and

417
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,490
most of his vampire crew it would be

418
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:11,870
slaughtered in any fight with the wolves

419
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,370
I don't understand why Sam hasn't gone

420
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:14,959
full home-invasion on the Kaulitz in

421
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,279
fact why haven't the werewolves done

422
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:17,660
something like start a fire smoke them

423
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:17,990
out

424
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:19,399
this waiting game seems kind of stupid

425
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:21,079
to me also this is the most nothingness

426
00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:22,459
ever happens this fucking movie I've

427
00:12:22,459 --> 00:12:24,019
ever seen sister why are these wolves so

428
00:12:24,019 --> 00:12:25,339
hell-bent on killing Bella's unborn

429
00:12:25,339 --> 00:12:27,709
child again I mean it's at best - half

430
00:12:27,709 --> 00:12:29,600
human half vampire thing right how is

431
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,829
that any scarier or more threatening

432
00:12:30,829 --> 00:12:32,360
than the pack of vampires living in your

433
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,560
region you've already made peace with

434
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,209
Jacob sets up a distraction for the

435
00:12:35,209 --> 00:12:36,620
other world so that Carlisle can run

436
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:37,970
through the woods with minimal werewolf

437
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,620
resistance but how's he know that when

438
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,970
he randomly walks into the woods enough

439
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:42,139
of the Wolves will come to talk to it

440
00:12:42,139 --> 00:12:43,490
meanwhile these wolves hear something

441
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:44,600
but decide not to tell their wolf

442
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,829
counterparts that there's some going

443
00:12:45,829 --> 00:12:46,970
down they might want to check out the

444
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,350
vampires we've seen in these movies are

445
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,240
like the flash but here these vampires

446
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,949
run kind of fast which is just slow

447
00:12:51,949 --> 00:12:54,829
enough to get run down by werewolves now

448
00:12:54,829 --> 00:12:56,509
how in the world did you - fuck this up

449
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:58,730
you played us any response well I'll

450
00:12:58,730 --> 00:12:59,240
just run away

451
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,480
it's employ EJ Edward Jacob Oh jolly

452
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,160
good gum now what do you say Albus

453
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,160
Severus Potter old chap

454
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,370
[Applause]

455
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,570
Bella drops a cop and symbol what

456
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:09,990
happens

457
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,490
so with absolutely no doctor on the

458
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:12,870
premises a shot of morphine and an

459
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,490
attempted leap term murder abortion

460
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:16,140
everything's just cool now it's almost

461
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:16,890
like they were able to press

462
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:18,240
fast-forward to somehow avoid all

463
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,800
complications of vampire demon baby

464
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,240
birth also did somebody cut the

465
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,980
umbilical cord because I do not think

466
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,450
somebody cut the umbilical cord scene

467
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:26,010
intended to be touching contains super

468
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:27,959
bloody baby now ah yeah I better just go

469
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:29,490
straight to the CPR without checking or

470
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:31,050
breathing or her consciousness by the

471
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:32,310
way Jacob are you trained for this type

472
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:32,640
of thing

473
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,980
Jacob take the baby keep that away from

474
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,020
me yeah I only want to save the mother

475
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,399
of that creature I despise not the

476
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,290
creature itself dumbass I'll take her I

477
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:42,600
promise I'm okay okay girl who nearly

478
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,190
murdered this kid just one minute ago I

479
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,540
guess I can trust you since the plot

480
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,100
demands it I can't wait to give you my

481
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,290
baby what is that it's my fan which I

482
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:50,640
just happen to have lying around in a

483
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,980
syringe in this drawer I won't kill you

484
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:56,010
you deserve to live with this this seems

485
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:56,880
like the perfect time to have this

486
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,450
conversation

487
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:59,010
well Bella's life hangs in the balance

488
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:00,510
so did biting her wrists and ankles

489
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:02,190
cause this or did the giant needle full

490
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:04,020
of his venom do it why is the venom only

491
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,880
working now the venom no it needed to

492
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,990
act in such a way that it would be

493
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:08,520
dramatic for the audience alright if she

494
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,620
cool now also why is no one watching her

495
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,120
it's like Jasper and Alice decided to go

496
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,470
to the room enough sex because nothing

497
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:14,850
makes sex better than complicated birth

498
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:16,380
that could kill the mother digital baby

499
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,820
is absolutely fucking creepy

500
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,709
Jacob will now imprint on this CGI demon

501
00:14:19,709 --> 00:14:21,450
baby which is still one of the creepiest

502
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:22,890
things about this series because it's

503
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:24,870
both parental and future mate stuff so

504
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,160
one can't help but wonder what it would

505
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,480
be like to protect a baby so that you

506
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,029
can forget in 18 years which just no one

507
00:14:30,029 --> 00:14:32,070
should have to ponder that also Jacob

508
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:33,870
imprints on a fucking baby he just fell

509
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,520
in love with a baby I just want everyone

510
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,290
to know Jacob fell in love with a baby I

511
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:38,640
don't care if that means they'll just be

512
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,200
friends or he'll be her protector or

513
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,279
whatever the fuck they want to do to

514
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,140
justify this he just fell in love with a

515
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,450
baby also why why is this the way

516
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:47,010
imprinting works for Jacob does he not

517
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:48,420
have any control over it he had

518
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,950
absolutely crazy feelings for Bella but

519
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:51,720
it never happened now he sees a digital

520
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:56,930
child and he's suddenly wolf goo

521
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:59,250
yeah but imprinting as discussed by the

522
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,959
movies themselves have always suggested

523
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,670
that one day you will back oh there they

524
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:02,850
are

525
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:04,050
fresh from whatever movies that were

526
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:05,279
shooting other than this one to finally

527
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,459
get back into the action Carlisle and s

528
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:10,260
my ex machina everything so dark who

529
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,089
cares what happens also werewolves had

530
00:15:12,089 --> 00:15:13,560
no idea they have sharp teeth and claws

531
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,120
opting to go with tackling and menacing

532
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,529
I mean these werewolves are awful

533
00:15:16,529 --> 00:15:18,209
fighters and Jakob all but predicted a

534
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:19,890
slaughter a minute ago they're terrible

535
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:21,029
and stupid and I want to go home

536
00:15:21,029 --> 00:15:24,360
werewolf imprints I can't be harmed it's

537
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,329
their most absolute law it is that's

538
00:15:27,329 --> 00:15:30,269
dumb why not wolf not kill wolf or wolf

539
00:15:30,269 --> 00:15:32,010
together strong stupid in printing

540
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:33,899
stupid Jakob somebody should write a law

541
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:35,670
about imprinting on vampire children too

542
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:37,709
late now stupid in pretty well some on

543
00:15:37,709 --> 00:15:39,269
dead body needs the sandwich why is this

544
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:40,200
taking so long

545
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,700
a minute ago we saw the venom working

546
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,930
and it's magic bringing her back to life

547
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:44,459
now there's a waiting process like we're

548
00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:46,410
at the DMV or some also when I was

549
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:48,149
turned it was nearly instantaneous wait

550
00:15:48,149 --> 00:15:50,240
I may have said too much

551
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,130
previously on all the Twilight's I open

552
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:54,750
in cliffhanger cliche not Danis movie

553
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,610
has 13 minutes of credits this

554
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:58,230
mid-credits scene serves solely to tell

555
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:59,910
us that Carlisle at the Volturi Nobel

556
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,380
has been turned and that the Volturi are

557
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,089
still evil which enhances my enjoyment

558
00:16:03,089 --> 00:16:04,709
of this movie and its credits negative

559
00:16:04,709 --> 00:16:06,540
12th also to recap Bella Edward got

560
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,220
married played some chess had rough sex

561
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,750
resulting in a fetus everyone waited

562
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,010
around a long-ass time at the Cullen

563
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:12,660
house then the baby was born and Jacob

564
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,430
has some weird sexual non-sexual tied to

565
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:16,980
it the end Jesus that's like five pages

566
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:24,070
of script for fuck's sake

567
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:29,360

key to our evolution it has enabled us

588
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:43,299
to evolve from a single-celled organism

589
00:17:43,299 --> 00:17:45,980
into the dominant species on the planet
