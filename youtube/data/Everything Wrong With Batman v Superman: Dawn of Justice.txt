1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:11,280
DC Comics there was a time above

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,049
let me ask everyone a question if every

3
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:14,309
screenwriter grows up being cold enough

4
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:15,630
to put narration in their movie unless

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:17,220
it enhances the story then why does

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,690
every screenwriter put narration that

7
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:20,039
doesn't enhance the story into their

8
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:21,810
screenplays for the third time in three

9
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,760
Batman franchises we get the dead parent

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,500
origin story I guess they did try to

11
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,740
warn us at the beginning also this is

12
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,269
the type of theater that plays the 1940

13
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:32,040
film the Mark of Zorro but also coming

14
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,840
soon because this is 1981 after all

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,610
Excalibur Zack the public has already

16
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,050
seen Bruce Wayne's parents death several

17
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,329
times yes but have they seen it in slow

18
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:39,719
motion

19
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:41,100
Bruce falls into a hole that would kill

20
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,930
most people and he's not Batman yet and

21
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:45,210
you be the Batcave if he wanted to steal

22
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:46,500
the pearls why'd he intentionally got

23
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,210
the necklace by pulling this gun bolt

24
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:49,590
now I'll have to pick them out of the

25
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,149
rich people blood over goddamn you so

26
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:57,090
slow goddamn motion no remember this it

27
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,230
will become inexplicably and

28
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:05,590
infuriatingly important later

29
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:08,260
King what also confidence-building back

30
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,930
tornado a beautiful lie Ben Affleck

31
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:12,850
describes this movie in one sentence yep

32
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:14,259
no way the film could have started here

33
00:01:14,259 --> 00:01:15,610
we definitely needed to rehash his

34
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:16,930
parents death in order to understand

35
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:18,369
this totally in the middle of all this

36
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:19,900
bull Bruce really thought it was a good

37
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,369
idea to take a private helicopter into

38
00:01:21,369 --> 00:01:23,110
Metropolis for some reason here is Bruce

39
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:24,399
Wayne landing in Metropolis and

40
00:01:24,399 --> 00:01:25,479
immediately getting into his private

41
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:27,700
vehicle a Jeep King renegade the very

42
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:28,990
definition of a common middle class

43
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:30,399
vehicle I see one of these things at

44
00:01:30,399 --> 00:01:31,899
every goddamn stoplight Bruce Wayne

45
00:01:31,899 --> 00:01:33,369
would be driving a Tesla or the very

46
00:01:33,369 --> 00:01:35,409
least a BMW but not a goddamn Jeep yes

47
00:01:35,409 --> 00:01:36,940
the sequence of Bruce experiencing the

48
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:38,619
carnage of Man of Steel's climax is

49
00:01:38,619 --> 00:01:40,090
interesting it's also revisionist

50
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:41,380
history by the man who took too

51
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:42,759
personally the criticism that Man of

52
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:44,050
Steel killed too many innocent people

53
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:45,640
so whatever mobile network these people

54
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,050
are using is apparently alien attack

55
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:48,700
proof and here I lose my signal when I'm

56
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,110
under an umbrella I want you to get

57
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,580
everyone out of the building right now

58
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,140
Jack besides just now is the appropriate

59
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,119
time to evacuate makes you think he has

60
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,470
to ask Bruce's approval to go to the

61
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:00,580
bathroom Bruce Wayne alone running into

62
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,289
the fray while everyone else panics yeah

63
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:04,119
even in a movie the I'm duty-bound to

64
00:02:04,119 --> 00:02:08,739
remove sins for something so badass do

65
00:02:08,739 --> 00:02:10,869
you think also good King eyesight to

66
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:12,370
spot mr. Wayne at that distance in a

67
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:13,840
dust cloud this guy's trapped underneath

68
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,790
one single girder like a whole building

69
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:17,140
just fell and apparently the only Robo

70
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,700
is a lot of dust and a couple girders in

71
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,200
the middle of a dust cloud from ground

72
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,820
level and without any visual enhancement

73
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,470
gear on how the hell can Bruce clearly

74
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,000
see these two fighting he barely saw the

75
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,410
girl right next to him little girl who

76
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:27,850
lost her mother stands here waiting for

77
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,140
Bruce Wayne Hux because she knows how

78
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,850
close the Wayne logo sign is and how

79
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:34,820
cool a shot it will make

80
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,990
Hans Zimmer's finger gets stuck on the

81
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,970
Dom button the somewhere is implied by

82
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:40,590
simply saying it's the Indian Ocean all

83
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,610
it takes to get the most precious

84
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:43,260
element on earth is a couple free divers

85
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,760
with a motorboat and a dream is that

86
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,140
ever explained how this Kryptonian

87
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,670
vessel full of kryptonite crash-landed

88
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,680
in Indian fucking ocean also kryptonite

89
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,090
in case you confused it with Nairobi

90
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:52,800
Judd oh hey it's Jimmy Olsen the

91
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,300
grounding moral center in this universe

92
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,070
of superhero pretense man I really hope

93
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,330
he gets a lot of screen time somehow

94
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:58,590
they're gonna be able to blame Superman

95
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,060
for all these headshots because if

96
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,560
there's anything Superman needs it's a

97
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,880
gun Superman shows up out of nowhere

98
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,740
because I guess he can sense when Lois

99
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,360
is in danger don't give me that he was

100
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,740
following the beacon craft because if he

101
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,000
was really interested in all this he'd

102
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,620
already be there the world has been so

103
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,520
caught up with what Superman can do that

104
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,560
no one has asked what he should do this

105
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,210
is a direct ripoff of Jeff Goldblum

106
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:19,530
Jurassic Park quote and the writer

107
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,240
should be ashamed uh if I had a nickel

108
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,770
for every time I fingered a bullet well

109
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,360
naked we'll just assume Clark took his

110
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,130
phone out his pocket before this because

111
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:27,480
otherwise Superman is a dick to

112
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,980
smartphones I don't understand even in a

113
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,210
different language the pronoun game

114
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:35,070
never ceases to hilariously confuse I

115
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:36,900
mean how do you build this luxurious

116
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,150
bachelor pad without skilled contractors

117
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,830
who you then either need to pay off or

118
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:42,540
kill my biggest issue with any Batman

119
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,100
story actually someone explain to me how

120
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,510
Alfred and Bruce alone designed and

121
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:47,820
built this please hurry Bob our final

122
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,710
fairy bottom off funnel fairy butter bar

123
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,240
must be the English equivalent of

124
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,980
siblings feels like Bruce would have

125
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,480
been wise to Superman in his secret

126
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,190
identity long ago being the best

127
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,630
detective in the world and all but this

128
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:58,950
movie would have you believe that Wayne

129
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,330
really only got interested in this guy

130
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:01,709
after he helped destroy a whole city

131
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:02,940
maybe these eggs would be in better

132
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,860
shape a holy shield a wall of wrenches

133
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,270
and tools just off the kitchen and

134
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:08,040
behind the TV and next year upside down

135
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,930
bike Jesus are you Matthew McConaughey

136
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,730
the first victim an accused child

137
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:14,130
predator later was assaulted in prison

138
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:15,959
many believe the mark of the bat brand

139
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:18,510
in prison essentially is a death

140
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,400
sentence what a bunch of bull someone

141
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,870
can make that observation after that

142
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,880
huge sample size of one person got beat

143
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,320
up in prison and don't child molesters

144
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,790
usually get beaten in jail anyway I've

145
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,860
smelled manufacture attention welcome to

146
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,210
LexCorp which apparently rebuilt

147
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:32,130
metropolis in 18 months based on tons of

148
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:34,020
money hard work and either the dragon

149
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,910
tears of unicorn angels or the aliens

150
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:36,720
from Jupiter ascending

151
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,640
nerdy Lex is introduced being nerdy on

152
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,350
the basketball court yet still nailing a

153
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,880
three-pointer like Steph Curry I hate

154
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,800
this priority finally a movie put so

155
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,270
many newspaper headlines and stories in

156
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,330
one shot and with such

157
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:48,069
tiny print I don't care to actually go

158
00:04:48,069 --> 00:04:49,870
digging for mistakes Touche movie I'm

159
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,400
glad this guy helpfully underlined and

160
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,960
boxed mentions of Superman on these

161
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,729
newspaper headlines or else he might

162
00:04:54,729 --> 00:04:56,110
have gotten them confused with articles

163
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:57,400
about Captain America or Dwayne the rock

164
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,439
Johnson Superman statue does not depict

165
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:01,360
Superman twisting Zod's neck but I guess

166
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,500
that's kind of hard to curve in rock

167
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,349
yeah do sports today because newspaper

168
00:05:05,349 --> 00:05:06,759
writers play musical chairs with the

169
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:08,080
kinds of stories they write on a daily

170
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,840
basis headline end of love affair with

171
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,879
men the sky Mary whites editorial style

172
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,590
is to literally dictate headlines to his

173
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:15,849
writers and ask them to write stories

174
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:17,169
that match you know I like Jesse

175
00:05:17,169 --> 00:05:17,710
Eisenberg

176
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:19,750
but this Lex Luthor is - Jesse Eisenberg

177
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,669
is that a kryptonite scalpel how does

178
00:05:21,669 --> 00:05:23,379
Lex know he needs a fingerprint who

179
00:05:23,379 --> 00:05:27,940
knows he just knows mmm nine and a half

180
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,740
weeks looks like basically everyone has

181
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,030
been breaking fight clubs first two

182
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:34,319
rules crime wave and Gotham other

183
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:38,349
breaking news water wet okay Perry White

184
00:05:38,349 --> 00:05:40,210
is basically just a dick dismissing a

185
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:41,680
story about a vigilante in Gotham as

186
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,569
completely unused worthy while asking

187
00:05:43,569 --> 00:05:45,250
for an update on a story about football

188
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,750
I can't both stories be interesting to

189
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,310
the public I'm blocking the import

190
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,110
license for your mineral something I

191
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,310
could have just called to tell you you

192
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,840
can call me whatever you like take a

193
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,029
bucket of piss and call it grand HPT

194
00:05:55,029 --> 00:05:56,919
aside from being a fantastically stupid

195
00:05:56,919 --> 00:05:58,719
line it's made even worse by only being

196
00:05:58,719 --> 00:05:59,979
here to give us some kind of suppose a

197
00:05:59,979 --> 00:06:01,719
payoff later at the hearing but most of

198
00:06:01,719 --> 00:06:03,250
all what the fuck does that even mean

199
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,900
are you the bucket of piss in this

200
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,180
analogy also surprisingly granny's peach

201
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,710
tea was the only company that turned

202
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:10,240
down the promotional tie-in with Batman

203
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,460
V Superman oh this is a dream I mean any

204
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,629
other movie the slow motion would have

205
00:06:13,629 --> 00:06:14,440
served as warning

206
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,060
second dream sequence is necessary to

207
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,889
show how tough Bruce is but including

208
00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:19,449
yet another jump scare is necessary to

209
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:20,979
show what an asshole this movie is you

210
00:06:20,979 --> 00:06:24,069
know it balls like yours you belong in

211
00:06:24,069 --> 00:06:26,680
here that's racist well Bruce Wang can't

212
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,539
break into Lex Luthor's house Bruce

213
00:06:28,539 --> 00:06:31,599
Wayne right half Jim he's been invited

214
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,729
how fortuitous and not as exciting a

215
00:06:33,729 --> 00:06:34,810
movie that would have been much better

216
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,279
than this is given me your Easter egg

217
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:38,409
treatment because that's fun is that

218
00:06:38,409 --> 00:06:40,120
seriously Clark Kent does not know who

219
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,819
Bruce Wayne is gotta hear this room that

220
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,319
no one should enter is easily accessible

221
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,180
by simply pushing open the door not the

222
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,669
bathroom was down here I must have Bruce

223
00:06:48,669 --> 00:06:50,589
Wayne dares to try this and she pretends

224
00:06:50,589 --> 00:06:52,120
to believe it and Bruce seems to think

225
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,440
it got away with it all of which is

226
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,000
ridiculous after following him and

227
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,440
checking on him and hearing his flimsy

228
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,389
ass excuse this Luther security chick

229
00:06:58,389 --> 00:06:59,870
leaves him alone in the compute

230
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,850
what the fuck I like how Clarke heard

231
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:03,530
Bruce's radio communications but did

232
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:04,820
nothing to investigate it

233
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,160
Superman is lazy Bruce Wayne meets Clark

234
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,710
Kent looks Luthor knows why this would

235
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:11,510
be a momentous occasion but God help you

236
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,190
if you want an explanation for why he

237
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:15,560
knows what nobody else does oh wow that

238
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,300
is a good grip you should not pick a

239
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,890
fight with this person again I have no

240
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:20,480
idea if it was the script the director

241
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,130
or the actor who decided this character

242
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:23,480
needed to be this far over the top but

243
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,340
it was a bad decision okay she took his

244
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,570
thing and obviously wants him to know

245
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:28,100
because she hangs around to get caught

246
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,540
staring at him right outside the door

247
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:30,830
but then she leaves without telling him

248
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,030
anything so what gives

249
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:33,830
this is whack-ass behavior Superman

250
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:36,530
Jesus 90% of people believe in a higher

251
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:37,970
power and I'm gonna need a source on

252
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:40,520
that statistic dude on this earth every

253
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,800
act is a political act even twerking

254
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,810
international bloggers are there no

255
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:46,280
journalists and experts left in this

256
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,050
reality willing to go on cable news or

257
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,160
is this the movie just giving the finger

258
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,660
to the internet community that dislike

259
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,250
Manta steel I'm glad Superman saved

260
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,810
these astronauts but this scene is

261
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:55,190
really pessimistic about the state of

262
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:56,570
space travel and successful rocket

263
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:58,010
launches know using Neil deGrasse Tyson

264
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:00,020
for your own personal projects this

265
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,460
family literally managed to get to the

266
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,870
roof with their bodies and some white

267
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,880
paint and that's it no sandwiches or

268
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,440
nothing and while I'm not sure that one

269
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,490
can of paint would be enough to paint

270
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:09,290
this giant ass Superman logo I'm more

271
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:10,640
concerned with the logic these people

272
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,440
used hey there's a flood everyone get to

273
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,850
the roof and someone grab some paint so

274
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:15,290
we can make a giant Superman logo on the

275
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:16,850
roof that if he somehow happens to be in

276
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:18,110
the area saving lives he won't miss

277
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,460
again another instance of a cool

278
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,990
storyboard trumping logic in a Snyder

279
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,850
film then Superman king hovers for a few

280
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,590
seconds doubtless confused by the huge

281
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:26,300
white logo before actually saving these

282
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,160
poor assholes this guy who just got

283
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,810
thrown in jail for defacing the Superman

284
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,580
statue and making terrorist threats gets

285
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,540
to have a meeting with the senator

286
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:34,400
instantly without any security let's

287
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,280
copy all right nothing about food even

288
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,720
though it is ridiculous Clark was told

289
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,250
to write about football and he's doing

290
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,300
the right thing by writing about the

291
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,650
Gotham bat this should have gotten him

292
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:44,300
fired but he cares about Clark Kent

293
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,530
taking on the Batman

294
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:47,030
he's right they care about Superman

295
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,770
taking on the Batman of which this movie

296
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:50,630
titled Batman V Superman has very little

297
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,790
is it stealing if you steal from another

298
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:53,290
two

299
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:55,180
yes Bruce Wayne's decryption software

300
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,889
moves at the same pace as my youtube

301
00:08:56,889 --> 00:08:58,720
uploads luckily this decryption will

302
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,639
last just long enough for a holy fucking

303
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:02,620
unnecessary third 4 minute Batman dream

304
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,180
sequence guy with a gun has a clear shot

305
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,070
of Batman here but the signs instead to

306
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:07,720
run up to Batman to shake his hand I

307
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,370
guess just to clarify Batman is knocked

308
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:10,990
unconscious during his own dream and

309
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:12,490
when he wakes up from that dream he's

310
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:13,750
going to have another cryptic dream

311
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,130
about a visitor from an unknown future

312
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,959
movie is seriously trying to out dream

313
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,279
inception I'd just like to know how

314
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:19,660
Bruce is hallucinating the flash right

315
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,459
now giving him important information and

316
00:09:21,459 --> 00:09:22,990
advertising the standalone movie all at

317
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:25,620
once does Bruce have sue saying powers

318
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,819
Bruce's nightmares lasted exactly as

319
00:09:27,819 --> 00:09:29,050
long as his computer's decryption

320
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:30,819
process racin if we believe there's even

321
00:09:30,819 --> 00:09:32,740
a 1% chance that he is our enemy we have

322
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:35,079
to take it as the absolute sir math is

323
00:09:35,079 --> 00:09:36,730
not one of Bruce's strong suits where

324
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:38,290
does he go why do you continue to employ

325
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:40,329
him Batman harpoons this car which he

326
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:41,319
will drag around for a little while

327
00:09:41,319 --> 00:09:43,000
until knowing exactly how to unhook it

328
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,259
so that it will land on another car

329
00:09:44,259 --> 00:09:45,730
hiding behind a trailer something he

330
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:46,990
definitely knew was going to happen when

331
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:48,190
he harpoon the car in the first place

332
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:50,139
Superman who definitely knew some was

333
00:09:50,139 --> 00:09:51,610
going down here tonight didn't bother to

334
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:52,990
simply talk to Batman before all this

335
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:54,130
started essentially you're telling me

336
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:55,870
he's omniscient enough to be here he's

337
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,160
omniscient enough to save a rocket from

338
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,959
an explosion for chrissake but decided

339
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,490
to enter the scene at this very moment

340
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:02,319
because it's better for the drama also

341
00:10:02,319 --> 00:10:03,730
why not do this out of the gate instead

342
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:04,810
of spending weeks or months

343
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:06,550
investigative journalism in Batman as

344
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,959
Clark Kent it takes an hour and four

345
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:09,639
minutes for Batman to be Superman in a

346
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:11,350
much more realistic feeling movie this

347
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:13,269
Batcave entrance will somehow top Burton

348
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:15,880
and Schumacher for silliness how do we

349
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,860
determine what's good a question the

350
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,329
makers of this movie clearly never asked

351
00:10:19,329 --> 00:10:19,870
themselves

352
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,519
Superman visits Kansas at the perfect

353
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,139
time the world's planetarium is open

354
00:10:23,139 --> 00:10:24,730
somebody wanna turn around and look

355
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:26,500
guilty I'm still not sure how blowing

356
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,120
away a whole bunch of dudes with special

357
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,019
bullets is supposed to implicate

358
00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:31,120
Superman so story reeks of bullshit but

359
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,350
how could they know that he'd show up in

360
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:33,490
the middle of the desert

361
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:35,230
Lois asks a very good question that is

362
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:36,880
never answered in fact the only thing

363
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,079
she's concerned about in this revelation

364
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:39,550
is that Superman is going to show up at

365
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:40,990
the Capitol building and she suspect

366
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:42,430
something's about to go down but the how

367
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:43,870
does Superman know to show up in the

368
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,100
right place question is better left

369
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,630
answered by other movies in the Justice

370
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:48,100
League franchise once the screenwriters

371
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,569
come up with a good enough excuse how

372
00:10:49,569 --> 00:10:51,160
did he know when she'd spot the label on

373
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,540
her glass to be able to time this bomb

374
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,279
blast you know it's not that Superman is

375
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:55,839
angry it's just that he's disappointed

376
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,459
movie skips over what would have been a

377
00:10:57,459 --> 00:10:59,019
much more entertaining Batman breaks in

378
00:10:59,019 --> 00:11:00,550
a lexcorp's scene to give a Superman

379
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:01,870
walking through the Capitol into a

380
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:02,260
courtroom

381
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,459
how does Lex know there's a pool of

382
00:11:03,459 --> 00:11:05,139
water who's on the ship and how does he

383
00:11:05,139 --> 00:11:06,670
know standing in it not only won't kill

384
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,050
it'll do something amazing to the body

385
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:09,730
of Zod Lex's omniscient enough that I

386
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:11,110
wonder why he struggles against Superman

387
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,760
and Batman at all actually even though

388
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,960
he got in the front door using Zhaan's

389
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,700
fingerprints Lex only has to press his

390
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,230
own palm on the receiver to get the ship

391
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:18,580
to respond it's telling that versus

392
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,990
CrossFit routine is the fourth most

393
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:21,520
enjoyable part of this movie Bruce is

394
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,190
addictive weights Alexander Luthor your

395
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:26,230
security override has been accepted but

396
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:27,940
why I feel like this movie has skipped

397
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,560
over some integral parts of storytelling

398
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,420
here just accept this just accept that

399
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,890
you came here to make doomsday fine

400
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:34,300
we'll help you do that this water-based

401
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,610
Kryptonian King Star Trek replicator of

402
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:38,620
all knowledge and science yeah okay get

403
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,180
hard I really hate it and it's stupid

404
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,650
that it exists and even stupider that

405
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:44,200
Luthor figures it all out okay so with a

406
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,520
little bit of Luthor's blood mixed with

407
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,320
Zod's dead body and some sort of DNA

408
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,270
pool of Justice Lex will be able to make

409
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,980
a monster out of it knew the spaceship

410
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,510
had this kind of ability why would a

411
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:53,980
spaceship have this kind of ability the

412
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,570
set of Superman movies is obsessed with

413
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:57,730
dead father's giving Clark advice Misha

414
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:59,440
son no you don't you're dead

415
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,090
why doesn't Superman have the same in

416
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:02,830
trouble radar for his mom that he seems

417
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:04,720
to have for Lois yeah I'll set my bat

418
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,310
booby trap right here blocks if not

419
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,750
miles from the start of my fight with

420
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,280
Superman because I know for a fact I can

421
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,780
direct the fight back to this spot for a

422
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:11,170
wedding

423
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:12,370
ladies and gentlemen Gotham the

424
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:13,960
metropolis star mile apart you're

425
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,060
welcome also it is just across the bay

426
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,470
but while Gotham is having torrential

427
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,700
rain and storms the weather in

428
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,890
Metropolis is just peachy Lois in danger

429
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:22,240
in the Middle East or later in this

430
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,350
climax when trapped in a box

431
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:25,000
Superman hears it above all the noise of

432
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,680
the world Lois is kidnapped Superman

433
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,360
hears nothing stupid triangle inequality

434
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,040
the shortest distance between any two

435
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,660
points I mentioned how much I hate this

436
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:32,950
version of Lex Luthor because I do

437
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:35,110
spewing random does not equal menacing

438
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:37,300
also fYI we are right at the start of

439
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,710
the film's climax with still an hour

440
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:40,390
left to go oh look he can hear her

441
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,770
falling but he couldn't hear her being

442
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:43,060
kidding out the last 30 minutes of her

443
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,800
life what a selective power Superman

444
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,750
just leaves Lois here what we call God

445
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,550
depends upon our tribe Clark Joe

446
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:50,530
Superman let's Lex talk long enough for

447
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:51,850
Lex to reveal he's got Clark's mom

448
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:53,200
instead of just obliterating him

449
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,730
instantly as he should have and would

450
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:57,300
have really done God versus man

451
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:01,380
oh come on Martha Martha Martha do I

452
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,880
consider this Martha Martha Martha

453
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,410
foreshadowing considering what comes

454
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:06,210
later break a bunch foreshadowing really

455
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:08,070
also Lex goes to the trouble to make

456
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:09,960
individual Polaroids because scrolling

457
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,190
through pictures on his phone would take

458
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:14,250
too long yeah don't you know I mean you

459
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,960
seem to find Louis no problem do you

460
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,430
only have a homing beacon on her

461
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:19,380
LexCorp new to make these files almost

462
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,970
like teaser trailers it's amazing their

463
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:22,500
marketing department collect miles Dyson

464
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,940
still hasn't learned his lesson about

465
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,590
not creating terminators even after he

466
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:27,210
died in the second movie and forget the

467
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:29,250
heliport put it on the goddamn roof okay

468
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,720
even though it's weird that the helipad

469
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,130
isn't already on the roof what

470
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:33,320
difference would it make

471
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,880
let's talk about Batman's plan sure

472
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,100
Superman told him next time they shine

473
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,890
your light in the sky don't go to it

474
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:42,060
there are numerous problems with this

475
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,800
though first off did Bruce forget that

476
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,360
Superman was in hiding after the Capitol

477
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,380
building bombing did he really think

478
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,760
their petty squabble was going to lure

479
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,440
him out second off this plan wasn't even

480
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,090
going to work until Lex kidnapped Martha

481
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:52,530
and told Superman to go fight Batman

482
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:53,760
there's an alternate history of the

483
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,990
movie where Batman lies in wait for

484
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:56,550
Superman and he never shows up like that

485
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,140
date I had in college and we had plans

486
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,480
Melissa Bruce when did these assholes

487
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,280
learn each other's secret identity was

488
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,410
it at the party did they just assume but

489
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,330
here's the rub Lex Luthor also has to

490
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:07,710
know that both Superman and Batman know

491
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:09,000
each other secret identities for his

492
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,860
plan to work if flex tells Superman to

493
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:11,370
kill Batman

494
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:12,990
and if Batman isn't lying in wait for

495
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:14,580
Superman at this moment and Superman has

496
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,020
to find Bruce Wayne and that's if he

497
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,370
knows Batman is Bruce that's a lot of

498
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:20,730
ifs you don't understand we'll find that

499
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:22,170
Superman will waste a lot of time with

500
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:23,190
the listen to me and you don't

501
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:24,660
understand instead of just saying what

502
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,980
the problem is not sure what these

503
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,900
machine guns were supposed to do but Wow

504
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:32,640
shiny excitement oh good more of this ah

505
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,650
kryptonite the unfortunate repetitive

506
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:36,060
writer's crutch that plagues nearly all

507
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,800
Superman movies how much does this miss

508
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,450
diminish Superman's powers we have no

509
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:40,830
idea and are never told though it's safe

510
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:42,210
to assume it's enough to make a Batman

511
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:43,830
Superman fight viable which I would

512
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:46,510
think would mean a lot

513
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,610
he's this debilitated by the Kryptonite

514
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:50,380
gas just kill his ass right now what are

515
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,040
you waiting for

516
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,630
oh yeah kryptonite gas it wears off

517
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:53,709
apparently even though it's completely

518
00:14:53,709 --> 00:14:55,540
inside Superman's lungs not even though

519
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,699
aura Batman can stop Superman I'm

520
00:14:57,699 --> 00:15:00,209
confused

521
00:15:00,209 --> 00:15:02,829
the Wayne in pain chooses mainly to

522
00:15:02,829 --> 00:15:04,389
complaint oh look Batman was totally

523
00:15:04,389 --> 00:15:05,709
able to leave the battle to this spot

524
00:15:05,709 --> 00:15:07,600
even though that's goddamn impossible it

525
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,709
might be the stupidest thing in this

526
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:11,760
movie which is saying something

527
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,440
Omar oh god damn it

528
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,850
first off who calls their mother by the

529
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,410
real name in this situation this is

530
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:18,399
maybe the biggest scene in the whole

531
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,410
movie second off god damn it because

532
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:21,790
Clark and Bruce both have mothers named

533
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,440
Martha Batman decides to let Superman

534
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,899
live and goddamn at third Martha is a

535
00:15:25,899 --> 00:15:28,060
common name Martha is a common name

536
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,260
you're telling me that at the mere

537
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,550
mention of Martha Batman gets all

538
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:31,120
sentimental

539
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,220
Martha Parkers yeah yeah we know we

540
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,630
heard Thomas the comedian Wayne st.

541
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:36,370
Martha out loud earlier in the movie we

542
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:37,959
saw the earlier dream sequence this

543
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:39,339
movie's seventeenth such occurrence

544
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:41,110
where it showed Martha Wayne's tombstone

545
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:42,880
we know his mother's name is Martha get

546
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,620
on with it just in case this movie isn't

547
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,209
long enough for you we got a recap of

548
00:15:46,209 --> 00:15:47,800
the first five minutes why did you say

549
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,040
that guy exactly his mother's name it

550
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,329
took Lois Lane to fly here in a

551
00:15:52,329 --> 00:15:53,800
helicopter for some reason to finally

552
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,569
tell him that really that slow is his

553
00:15:55,569 --> 00:15:56,920
only function for flying out here he's

554
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,690
for stupid like this but don't worry it

555
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:02,680
gets stupider he wanted your life ours

556
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,810
now that they fought Superman suddenly

557
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:05,980
comes up with the words he could have

558
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,149
easily said before all the fighting

559
00:16:07,149 --> 00:16:13,899
started hot damn this is Batman

560
00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:15,399
I'm removing three scents for this movie

561
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:16,899
understanding Batman action better than

562
00:16:16,899 --> 00:16:18,339
any previous even though that's not

563
00:16:18,339 --> 00:16:19,930
nearly close enough to save this film's

564
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:22,690
final scene total on Sunday sauce I

565
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,300
figured the Cape this is the only moment

566
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,920
of levity in the entire film and that

567
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,899
makes it worth a sin a sin of omission a

568
00:16:28,899 --> 00:16:30,310
character I respect suddenly turned

569
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:32,019
stupid and throws this crypto spear into

570
00:16:32,019 --> 00:16:33,730
this water thinking that over time no

571
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:35,529
one will ever find it and so that the

572
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:36,970
movie will have an ex machina wants

573
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:38,800
tombs day shows up yeah we'll do it

574
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,389
this is some convenient ask timing here

575
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:42,130
he just found out his original plan

576
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:42,579
failed

577
00:16:42,579 --> 00:16:44,019
but his backup plan is literally three

578
00:16:44,019 --> 00:16:46,930
seconds from powering up blood of my

579
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:47,649
blood

580
00:16:47,649 --> 00:16:49,209
Superman just stands around while he

581
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:50,350
waits for Luthor to do the next thing

582
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:51,970
instead of throwing him around the world

583
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,529
50 times are just taking him to jail

584
00:16:53,529 --> 00:16:55,360
barn to destroy you

585
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,699
but how you just cut yourself and put

586
00:16:57,699 --> 00:16:59,520
Zhaan's body you know what the do I

587
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:03,920
let's just get this over with already oh

588
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,110
good more of this thankfully though the

589
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,970
workday is over in the downtown core

590
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:11,579
it's nearly empty bull it's funny how

591
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:13,140
this movie in civil war suddenly started

592
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,370
caring about all the destruction their

593
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:15,660
heroes were causing and then started

594
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,280
making absolutely sure even though it's

595
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,110
impossible that no one are hardly anyone

596
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:20,670
is in the area one a woman is getting on

597
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:22,350
a plane and sees the super fight on the

598
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:24,329
news but no airplane I've ever been on

599
00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:26,040
gave me live television on the monitors

600
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,990
prior to takeoff so this is a bull and

601
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:29,420
this doesn't even look like first-class

602
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,830
Strykers Island east of Metropolis

603
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:33,720
that's uninhabited of course it is

604
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,550
I'm saying it's unkillable and I know

605
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:36,750
that because I'm sitting in an office

606
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,520
and we've tried one thing to kill it I

607
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,000
gotta get it to chase me back to City

608
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,010
exit - or you could just fly there get

609
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:45,809
it and fly back either wait really but

610
00:17:45,809 --> 00:17:47,250
go ahead with your he has to chase me

611
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,630
plan I sure am glad they rebuilt

612
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:50,340
metropolis so the doomsday can destroy

613
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,530
metropolis who knew Wonder Woman's

614
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,059
bracelets can stop all the doomsday

615
00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:55,679
Kryptonian laser beams in the world even

616
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,240
when the total area of said lasers

617
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,370
eclipses the area of said bracelets also

618
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,960
Wonder Woman ex-market up she just got

619
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,370
off the plane was able to dress up get

620
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:04,080
to the scene and know exactly what to do

621
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,240
just in time also the fight one woman

622
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,980
saw was happening in Metropolis and this

623
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:11,780
is now happening in Gotham so few movie

624
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,760
even though louis has no idea who

625
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,770
doomsday is or what he does she gets the

626
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:17,210
bright idea that maybe they need that

627
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:18,890
crypto sphere after all what did you

628
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,720
bring him back to the city a port is

629
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,440
abandoned

630
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,419
yeah yeah everywhere is abandoned we get

631
00:18:23,419 --> 00:18:26,419
it she would you I thought yours is here

632
00:18:26,419 --> 00:18:28,220
really Bruce you've seen her and

633
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,780
interacted with her half-dozen times at

634
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,100
this point what is this line except

635
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,270
scripted hilarity that doesn't square

636
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:33,590
with the script and despite numerous

637
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:35,210
heavy pieces of architecture falling

638
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:36,890
down in this pool with Lois she survives

639
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:38,390
this it's actually hard to believe after

640
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:39,919
seeing Wonder Woman shield and bracelets

641
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,330
perform miracles that she doesn't have a

642
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:47,150
weapon that can just end this fool this

643
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:48,980
movie Superman can't just javelin this

644
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,450
thing into doomsday heart he has to

645
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:52,039
crash into him to do it so that the

646
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:53,510
movie can have its fake death scene oh

647
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:55,909
no Superman is dead obey and lasts until

648
00:18:55,909 --> 00:18:57,260
the next movie when they revive him and

649
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,610
move on this possibly be the most

650
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:00,049
insulting part of the movie the guy who

651
00:19:00,049 --> 00:19:01,669
looks like Superman with glasses died on

652
00:19:01,669 --> 00:19:03,380
the same night as Superman and still no

653
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,760
connection can we even get a Steve

654
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,169
Buscemi scene where we was living in an

655
00:19:06,169 --> 00:19:07,460
apartment surrounded by video screens

656
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,169
soda cans and beef jerky where he makes

657
00:19:09,169 --> 00:19:14,450
the connection I mean Jesus it's a movie

658
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:16,280
funeral so definitely add some bagpipes

659
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,870
because Superman was so Scottish and

660
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:20,600
such I failed on WoW actually you ended

661
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,860
up not killing in like you would plan

662
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,480
then when you promised to save his mom

663
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,250
you did that to in spectacular fashion

664
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,710
so you're good here bro we can do better

665
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:30,409
we will just not with this movie I guess

666
00:19:30,409 --> 00:19:32,090
either Batman got permission from the

667
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:33,620
warden to do this electric light show

668
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,270
and dramatic branding thing he's about

669
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:37,100
to do or he just knocked out the guards

670
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,510
to do it either way this is some pretty

671
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,110
unbelievable

672
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:42,590
he's hungry he's found us who the

673
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:43,730
you-know-what

674
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:45,380
there's no way Lex had yet another

675
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,030
monster in mind after making doomsday

676
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:47,990
and coming up with the plan to get

677
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:49,280
Batman and Superman to fight you know

678
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,600
that last 10 minutes you just went

679
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,830
through trying to make us think Superman

680
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:53,120
was dead especially when you're trying

681
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,740
to set up a Justice League movie yeah

682
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:59,970

683
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:02,140

684
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,330

698
00:21:05,499 --> 00:21:07,629
injustice to right that which is wrong
