2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,659
YouTube begitu 90 they coming to chill I

3
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:05,009
want to get through the power of the

4
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:06,810
Internet and look at this massive

5
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:10,980
package that just showed up I didn't

6
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:11,940
know what it was at first I was afraid

7
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,120
to open it but I read my email and I got

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,440
an email from the folks over at loot

9
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,270
crate and they told me to be expecting a

10
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,480
giant package and I presume this is it

11
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,300
so mate I'm gonna give them a call when

12

76
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,120
alright I pulled everything out of the

77
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,670
box starting off with a fire TV and I

78
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:15,430
didn't know this about

79
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,100
fire TV but this has Alexa voice

80
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,199
controls built-in so this is really cool

81
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:22,449
this is going into my bedroom so that I

82
00:04:22,449 --> 00:04:24,370
can watch Amazon and stuff like that

83
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,410
there it's like HBO Showtime

84
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:29,680
NBC Netflix Food Network the sling I

85
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,479
didn't know that this had all those

86
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:32,919
office but I never never have voice

87
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:36,130
control just to make sure I have a

88
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:38,530
decent Alexa device in the house and

89
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:41,169
you'll get this too there is an echo now

90
00:04:41,169 --> 00:04:43,300
I've got several different echos but

91
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,789
this is the top of the top of the line

92
00:04:45,789 --> 00:04:48,550
when I think it's not the video one this

93
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,500
is audio only but the speaker on this

94
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,360
one is amazing I've been working to

95
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,750
replace all my dots with this massive

96
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,280
echo but this one is amazing the sound

97
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,110
on this is so good and I can't wait to

98
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:08,470
get it set up now here's something I'm

99
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,210
completely unfamiliar with and maybe you

100
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,410
guys can tell me a little bit about it

101
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:13,539
in the comment section this is a so

102
00:05:13,539 --> 00:05:19,599
knows the home sound system huh all

103
00:05:19,599 --> 00:05:21,070
right well we should crack into this and

104
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,320
see what we're dealing with here let's

105
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:23,560
see

106
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,419
flexible compact size surprisingly

107
00:05:25,419 --> 00:05:28,150
powerful sound I mean if it sounds

108
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:28,900
better than that

109
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,760
echo I'm gonna be really surprised I

110
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,349
can't wait to try this this will this

111
00:05:32,349 --> 00:05:33,789
will end up in the studio for what I

112
00:05:33,789 --> 00:05:34,870
want play music in there this is gonna

113
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,580
be great alright this is what I'm used

114
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,020
to I already have two of these this is

115
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,300
gonna make my third one this is the echo

116
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,400
and I gotta say the sound on these are

117
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,259
absolutely amazing but the Sonos

118
00:05:44,259 --> 00:05:45,990
promises just by quick Google search

119
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,949
promises have much better sound I'm

120
00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:49,810
gonna tell you it's about twice as heavy

121
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:52,930
with about twice as much speaker space

122
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:55,659
and I realized I wanted to test these

123
00:05:55,659 --> 00:05:56,949
for you guys to let you see what the

124
00:05:56,949 --> 00:05:59,050
sound is like how do you do that with a

125
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:01,360
camera I don't know I'm gonna set these

126
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,979
up on my own time I was thinking I would

127
00:06:02,979 --> 00:06:04,419
love to show you the sound but I can't

128
00:06:04,419 --> 00:06:07,090
do that with a camera but man this is

129
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:09,250
awesome I absolutely love this

130
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,860
I really have a Bluetooth speaker in

131
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:14,110

00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:48,090
office I have look at this this is my

146
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:50,250
old monitor I've had this for like six

147
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,740
years it's an old Samsung 1080p number I

148
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,120
tried to replace it several times I was

149
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,009
just never satisfied and I never knew

150
00:06:56,009 --> 00:06:57,750
what monitor to buy so someone make a

151
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,979
decision for him he's the best thing

152
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:00,780
that they could do and my other monitor

153
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:05,460
is a 1080p Vizio television that I've

154
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:08,159
had for about five years this is my

155
00:07:08,159 --> 00:07:10,229
secret shame I'm so glad to replace it

156

163
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:29,039
