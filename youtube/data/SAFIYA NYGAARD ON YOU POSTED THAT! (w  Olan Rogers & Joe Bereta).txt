there could be throwing me off because

288
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:41,310
you would use the Facebook app and then

289
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:43,260
you're doing that there but that looks

290
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,400
like that might be a different app so

291
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,470
