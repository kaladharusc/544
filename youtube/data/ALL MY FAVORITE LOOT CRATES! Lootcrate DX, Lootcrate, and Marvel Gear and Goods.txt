ladies and gentlemen I need eight coming

9
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,130
up to level two get to the power of the

10
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:18,180
Internet and it's that time of month

11
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,720
again it's loot crate time three crates

12
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,460
to start with this month we got the big

13
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:24,990
expensive loot creep yeah it's very

14
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,390
heavy this won't do we got the Marvel

15
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,490
gear and goods crate and we have the

16
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:32,759
basic crate as well let's start with the

17
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:33,390
basic crate

18
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,610
now the basic crate runs about $19 a

19
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,020
month depending on where you live

20
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,370
I like the basic crate because there's

21
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,140
always a t-shirt in here and it's always

22
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,000
a really good deal for the price now

23
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,710
each month loot crate is based off of a

24
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,170
theme and this is October's crate so is

25
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,329
naturally horror themed or creature

26
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:50,190
themed look at that and cut out a little

27
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,539
mask under this one that's kind of cool

28
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:52,980
starting over the t-shirt that's my

29
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,180
favorite part about the basic crate is

30
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,210
there's always a really nice t-shirt oh

31
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:58,770
and this one is not bad that is attack

32
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:00,719
on Titan related if I'm not mistaken

33
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,690
that is a very cool shirt also in this

34
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,280
month's basic rate we have some socks

35
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,960
and these are kind of cool they're

36
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,729
Griffin's related that's straight up

37
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:09,840
stripe on your socks

38
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,880
okay these are cool socks now I heard

39
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,409
there was gonna be the Evil Dead item in

40
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:14,790
here and of course I'm excited about it

41
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:18,540
Evil Dead 2 oh oh my god this is gonna

42
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:19,650
be a figure so let's put this together

43
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:20,790
because this is gonna be great

44
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,439
alright the comedy that puts together

45
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:25,560
these little movie or television show

46
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,750
dioramas they do a really good job this

47
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,810
is a really cool concept I don't like

48
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:33,270
how chibi it is but I have several of

49
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,070
these some stranger things and other

50
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:35,670
lakritz

51
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,380
so these are pretty cool and this is

52
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,409
probably my favorite of them so far that

53
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:42,150
said though I just wish they weren't so

54
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:45,600
TV it's still pretty cute though here is

55
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,060
a new keyring from American Horror Story

56
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,520
this is from the hotel so he says the

57
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,670
hotel Cortez keyring in fact the back of

58
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:56,670
it even says please service room that is

59
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,590
kind of cool as far as key rings go that

60
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,570
is not bad it is kind of classy looking

61
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,490
and then finally here's this one spin

62
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:03,780
and it's pretty cool it's actually a

63
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,880
little Ouija board reader that's kind of

64
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,560
nice then the little booklet that shows

65
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,410
you everything you got and of course oh

66
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,510
this is the cursed crate is correct and

67
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:13,870
then of course it shows us the

68
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,640
mega crate this is we've already won a

69
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,629
mega crate we can never win one again

70
00:02:18,629 --> 00:02:21,250
dammit now again for the high rollers

71
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,260
out there there's loot crate DX you want

72
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,340
to spit a little bit more to get a

73
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,110
little bit more this is how you do it

74
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:28,360
now at first I thought this is a t-shirt

75
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,819
no this is 3x pajama bottoms and can you

76
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:34,450
see what that is

77
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:37,299
this is alien related I think is this

78
00:02:37,299 --> 00:02:42,489
alien vs. predator oh my god alright

79
00:02:42,489 --> 00:02:44,349
these are really cool I like these a lot

80
00:02:44,349 --> 00:02:46,420
I'm gonna put these on right now since

81
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,650
it's winter we're always gonna get a

82
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:50,470
winter style hat and this so it is oh

83
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:54,730
this one is venom or this one's venom

84
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:57,010
oh my god how do you not love this hat

85
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,650
this is warm I'm already hot but if you

86
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:01,000
can pull it down over your face and

87
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,700
see-through

88
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,670
oh speaking of predator I think this is

89
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:07,900
gonna have to be a mug it's a loot crate

90
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,049
exclusive something this seems really

91
00:03:11,049 --> 00:03:13,060
nice it's not actually a mug

92
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,099
it's a pint glass and this is actually

93
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:17,440
not just like painted on there it's kind

94
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,239
of embossed on there it's kind of raised

95
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:22,660
it's a nice quality paint glass is

96
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,220
actually kind of nice thick pretty heavy

97
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,530
with the really cool logo I don't think

98
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:27,340
this is going to come off in the

99
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,540
dishwasher that's nice

100
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:31,269
here's something x-files related it says

101
00:03:31,269 --> 00:03:35,829
it is a x-files dimensional poster let's

102
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:37,660
see what that is right this is actually

103
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,250
kind of cool I mean this is meant to sit

104
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,859
on your desk but at an angle look at

105
00:03:41,859 --> 00:03:44,169
that the spaceship is 3-dimensional

106
00:03:44,169 --> 00:03:46,599
should be called a 3-dimensional poster

107
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:47,879
because of the way this works that is

108
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:50,019
it's actually kind of cool that'll look

109
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:51,639
good on your desk on a shelf I like that

110
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:53,980
and then finally here's this must pen

111
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,379
and it's invader zim which should clue

112
00:03:56,379 --> 00:03:59,049
you in to the hint of what this crate

113
00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:01,690
was all about this was the invaders D X

114
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:03,220
crate there's all the cool stuff you got

115
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:06,220
and of course on the box the mega crate

116
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:10,660
we still can't win these mega crates and

117
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,609
then last but not least one of the

118
00:04:12,609 --> 00:04:14,139
specialty crates this is I think a

119
00:04:14,139 --> 00:04:15,099
quarterly crate

120
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:17,139
it's called marvel gear and goods and

121
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:19,479
previously some of the marble crates

122
00:04:19,479 --> 00:04:20,560
have been very good some of the marble

123
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,450
crates have been kind of a mess so I

124
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:23,500
hope this one's a hit

125
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,440
hopefully it's venom related nope even

126
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,370
better

127
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,410
it's spider-man related looks like

128
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:30,850
spider-man homecoming related its

129
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,470
letterman still my favorite Marvel hero

130
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,160
to date

131
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,139
alright this feels too thick to be a

132
00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:37,720
t-shirt oh let's go it's got a hoodie

133
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,500
and it's sleeveless oh oh

134
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,540
cuz it's Scarlet Spider it's a Scarlet

135
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:46,090
Spider hoodie okay I don't know if I'm

136
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:47,620
ready to go sleeveless out in the world

137
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,080
wearing a hoodie but if I ever do this

138
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,389
is the one I'm wearing here's a looks

139
00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:54,400
like just a cinch bag so these are

140
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,570
fairly cheap you can wear them as a

141
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:57,700
backpacker I know this is actually kind

142
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,620
of cool though it's got the web pattern

143
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:03,370
on one side Wow okay okay it's designed

144
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,889
to look like a webbed backpack was you

145
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:08,260
can see Peter Parker's stuff inside of

146
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,570
it foundations of chemistry textbook and

147
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:14,620
his chute okay alright this is as far as

148
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,300
cheeps inch bags go this one's kind of

149
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:16,690
cool

150
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:18,040
alright took me a minute to figure out

151
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,380
what it's supposed to be because it's a

152
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,060
very cool little symbiote spider-man

153
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,560
something it's made of metal so it's

154
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,139
nice and heavy what is this supposed to

155
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:29,110
be well it's a phone stand I guess you

156
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,460
could use it for just about anything

157
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,260
but it's designed to hold your phone up

158
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,690
in place so you can I guess watch

159
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:38,400
spider-man on your cell phone oh I guess

160
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,050
hmm I don't know it'll never use it for

161
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,970
that but this will be on a desk

162
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:44,979
somewhere here's a nice little rolled-up

163
00:05:44,979 --> 00:05:46,840
poster and a nice little tube I think

164
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,850
it's a poster but I love it when they

165
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:52,270
include it in a nice guarding tube it's

166
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:54,060
always such a pain to get it back oh

167
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,110
such a pain to get them back in there

168
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:59,229
look at this very cool lithograph of all

169
00:05:59,229 --> 00:06:02,280
these different spiders spiders suits

170
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,700
Wow

171
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,220
okay that is that is really nice it kind

172
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:09,580
of has a hand-drawn feel to it but I

173
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:10,930
kind of like that it kind of feels like

174
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:14,440
original art so hard to find a frame for

175
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,330
something this size I didn't may just

176
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:18,160
put this up on the wall well I'm sorry

177
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,570
I'm acting really weird right now

178
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:20,979
because I really like this it's probably

179
00:06:20,979 --> 00:06:23,110
the nicest piece of art they've sent in

180
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:25,330
a while I love this let me know what you

181
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:27,310
guys think about it and then finally

182
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,320
there's the pen and it's a very classic

183
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,990
comic panel with spider-man flipping

184
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:34,120
