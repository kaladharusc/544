2
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,210
creepy children's voices cliche two

3
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:13,590
minutes at the side of the house to make

4
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:15,150
sure everyone knows the upstairs windows

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,210
look like evil eyes Thunder scare ok now

6
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,370
flash the lights a couple times good no

7
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:21,900
seriously it'll look awesome when we put

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,560
in the sound effects this is a family of

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,360
the heaviest sleepers in existence how

10
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,770
did they not all wake up after the first

11
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:30,480
gunshot but stayed fast asleep in the

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,250
beds while he loudly shoots them one by

13
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:40,410
one reading this guy took an exorbitant

14
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,360
long time to speak he may be looking for

15
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,920
just the right words but based on what

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,450
he says it seemed more plausible that he

17
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:50,850
forgot his long ballpark guesses

18
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,680
insanely accurate considering that no

19
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,270
Mekhi ever amounted to anything in the

20
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,040
history of Hill Valley it could be a

21
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,750
guest house with a little fixing up new

22
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,430
windows fresh paint an exorcism

23
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:02,610
that's a wood-burning fireplace nice on

24
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:04,739
cold nights house hunters hauntings

25
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:11,130
edition barely any murders in this room

26
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:12,539
it's really the heart of your home it's

27
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:14,490
your first house we just got married

28
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:16,229
that doesn't answer the question but

29
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:18,719
nice exposition you know house is

30
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:20,069
clearly possessed by the ghost of George

31
00:01:20,069 --> 00:01:25,649
Bailey we already have a family two boys

32
00:01:25,649 --> 00:01:28,619
and a girl you are so bad why did he

33
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:29,880
want the realtor to think they had kids

34
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,429
out of wedlock the detective said that

35
00:01:32,429 --> 00:01:33,810
only the mother was shot in the head but

36
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,340
this clearly fuck's up their story the

37
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,599
first person in the house drove insane

38
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:38,310
was whoever installed a dance studio in

39
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,680
the master bedroom

40
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,230
now this is genuinely creepy because I

41
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:47,730
thought my blu-ray player for us so they

42
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:48,840
knew the whole time it was a murder

43
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,400
house not sure why they pretended to be

44
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,320
so unimpressed for the realtor just go

45
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,380
on and get ready to move why the hell

46
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,820
are they so excited there are quite a

47
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,080
few more steps you need to take before

48
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,310
you actually own the house they

49
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,330
definitely shouldn't be celebrating

50
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,560
right after the walkthrough I can't even

51
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,820
imagine what the inspection will be like

52
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,110
the foundation of the house is strong

53
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,520
considering its age but all the walls

54
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,660
are filled with blood would you

55
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,399
something to consider no evil occurred

56
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,649
for one entire month also is no one ever

57
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:11,790
gonna turn off the lights in the Attic

58
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,110
our priest just allowed a walk into

59
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,310
someone's house and go anywhere they

60
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,300
like I feel like this is a breach of

61
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,100
privacy even if he hears ghostly kid

62
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:20,459
chuckles upstairs the priest doesn't

63
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:21,750
just look out the window think to

64
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,970
himself oh they're outside turn around

65
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:25,440
and walk downstairs why is he looking at

66
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,030
these two flies like they're significant

67
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,560
I get that the Flies signify death but

68
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,360
just two flies as a normal non death

69
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,830
amount of flies even though this is now

70
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,090
a more appropriate time to turn around

71
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:34,590
I'm still not sure if the Flies are

72
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,420
there to signify death or the sweaty

73
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,890
priest just smells really bad is this

74
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,270
guy physically incapable of running away

75
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,890
when a Satan house is clearly giving him

76
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:44,820
fly warnings why Laura priest upstairs

77
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,200
with giggling sounds if you're trying to

78
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,489
kick him out of the house probably could

79
00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:48,840
have really spooked up the foyer you're

80
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,220
a man of God confronted with pretty

81
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,720
explicit proof of a threatening evil

82
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,220
then you walk away leaving the young

83
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,870
family behind making a mental note to

84
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:55,980
call them later this house apparently

85
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,330
possesses children to sleep in

86
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:58,500
uncomfortable ways matching

87
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,150
father-daughter shirts the murder ghosts

88
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,230
have the power to heat up plastic

89
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:02,580
telephone handles all the way across

90
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,190
town first of all her phone

91
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,690
troubleshooting skills are terrible

92
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:08,190
second of all our the demons possessing

93
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,420
the phone lines keeping them from

94
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,100
functioning properly or do they just

95
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,840
have pots lines they clearly didn't

96
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,860
conduct a home inspection before

97
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,600
purchasing the house so we'll never know

98
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,760
mirror Jesus pencil sharpener is mounted

99
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,410
on this doorway for easy access bumps

100
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:20,760
and bruises when you cut the corner into

101
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,170
the kitchen to close they've been in the

102
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:23,430
house a month and there's still of this

103
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:24,810
you have to avoid while walking down the

104
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:26,489
stairs this kid sucks at falling down

105
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:28,350
the stairs also a sit on his parents

106
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:29,280
we're not taking him to the emergency

107
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,690
room for the cuts he should have

108
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:31,950
obviously had on his hands for

109
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,690
bitch-slapping that lightball branded

110
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:35,100
the kid should be in bed by now but

111
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:39,040
you're doing this with an open door

112
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,659
is he saying she makes him vomit a kid

113
00:03:43,659 --> 00:03:45,250
is an unprotected sex ghost that haunts

114
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,260
you for at least 18 years also they're

115
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,760
really lucky she was rubbing her eyes or

116
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,900
she may have seen something that would

117
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,459
scar her more than what she'll end up

118
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:53,170
seeing during this movie also did she

119
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,640
just open the door and gently swing it

120
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,810
open and immediately start rubbing her

121
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:57,069
eyes I don't know what he's so happy

122
00:03:57,069 --> 00:03:59,980
about he didn't get to finish this is a

123
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,390
sound a cat would make if you played it

124
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,739
through a Casio keyboard that was being

125
00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:04,930
strangled by an Atari 2600 only two

126
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:07,120
grocery bags for a family of five also I

127
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,469
know it's just two bags but they are

128
00:04:08,469 --> 00:04:10,299
huge take two trips Kathy don't be a

129
00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:12,840
hero

130
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,799
Kathy shouldn't be making stuff up

131
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,539
around her crazed husband with an axe

132
00:04:16,539 --> 00:04:17,949
they aren't rolling down the block they

133
00:04:17,949 --> 00:04:19,120
aren't a week's worth of groceries and

134
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,680
you really don't need any help did your

135
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,479
friend Jodi like sugar cookies too I'm

136
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,039
unsure of whether the imaginary friend

137
00:04:24,039 --> 00:04:25,780
was a horror movie trope back then but

138
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,009
if this is one of the first times it's

139
00:04:27,009 --> 00:04:28,330
happened I'm going to sin it for the

140
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:29,410
sheer fact that it's been in almost

141
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:30,910
every horror movie about people moving

142
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,560
into a new house since then there is

143
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,849
clearly an eyeball in the upstairs

144
00:04:33,849 --> 00:04:35,470
window I'm probably gonna have a bruise

145
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:36,880
now because of how aggressively this

146
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,240
movie is trying to personify this house

147
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,139
it didn't seem like you were expecting

148
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:42,910
him seeing that you drove away in your

149
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:44,800
boat after he arrived no Amityville for

150
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,360
old men good news you're Murder House

151
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,159
struck oil also these ghosts are just

152
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:49,630
more of a nuisance than anything seems

153
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:50,830
like they're just drawing this family

154
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,210
it's known as the scariest thing I've

155
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:53,860
seen so far just because your aunt the

156
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,120
nun is visiting doesn't mean you have to

157
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,440
dress up like you're back in Catholic

158
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,120
school also does this nun need to wear

159
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,039
the full gear 24/7 is there not

160
00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:01,150
something a little simpler for a

161
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:02,289
personal day trip why are there only

162
00:05:02,289 --> 00:05:04,210
visitors clergy members but let's just

163
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:05,800
have no friends and on top of that none

164
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,030
of them have even bothered telling them

165
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:08,050
there's something off about your house

166
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,550
spiritually now I believe as soon as

167
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:13,570
possible that ship has sailed these look

168
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:15,760
like the lost BG since day one their

169
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,470
work should go I don't want to be up to

170
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:19,690
my ass in boxes forever this is supposed

171
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:21,190
to make him sound increasingly cold and

172
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,479
rude but he makes a very good point

173
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,750
about the stress of moving she might as

174
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,370
well say I was dreaming about the events

175
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:28,300
that happen in this house approximately

176
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,400
a year ago okay movie don't try and put

177
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,840
a red filter on just to distract me from

178
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,190
the fact that you're showing me the side

179
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,620
of the house for the 15th time

180
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,600
because this demons power extends to

181
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,160
cars driving down the road this horror

182
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,960
just went hard Tommy Boy I know the

183
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,160
priest has some sort of sixth sense

184
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,080
about flies but they're being everywhere

185
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,970
in general the carving up would just be

186
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:50,590
a coincidence oh he's a demon in this

187
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:51,970
house only wants to infect the father

188
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:53,050
and the daughter for some reason

189
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:59,230
everyone else the spirits in this house

190
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,700
want the family to leave why would they

191
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,260
steal this kids money if anything this

192
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,970
encourages them to stay and find it I

193
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:05,350
know everyone keeps commenting on how

194
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:06,790
bad George looks but if he would just

195
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:10,030
wash his hair look fine I'll take care

196
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,380
of him I'll write him a check

197
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,600
and uh what about the honeymoon I lost

198
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,040
that money too by the way who the fuck

199
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,600
is this demon it's with the babysitter

200
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,280
rather than simply making her sick or

201
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,330
telling her to leave why does this

202
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:20,950
bastard discriminate between priests the

203
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:22,540
family living there and under the table

204
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,010
child labor she's been locked in the

205
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,210
closet for less than a minute and is

206
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:26,620
already bloodying up her knuckles and

207
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,820
doesn't know about any malevolent

208
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,560
spirits we're gonna need you to calm way

209
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,760
down kid she cancelled checks bounced

210
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,560
checks is not cash I'd be worried this

211
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,000
guy is running a shady business that is

212
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,650
a front for something anyone who is this

213
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:40,000
scared of a check is probably up to no

214
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,270
good

215
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,530
it's moments like these where I feel

216
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:42,730
like I'm watching a rough cut of this

217
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:51,390
movie well then explain this keyhole

218
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,380
what are these spirits gonna do with

219
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,450
$1500 good luck trying to buy an Apple

220
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:59,200
too without a physical form asshole he

221
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,550
has a lot of passion for a priest who

222
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:01,930
hasn't really busted his ass to tell

223
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:03,460
these people what's going on I'd blame

224
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,320
Detroit a lot faster than the devil

225
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,720
that's Detroit us also trained priest is

226
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,160
unable to distinguish between Detroit

227
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,690
and the devil also I get the sense that

228
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:12,220
Marie Hamilton was always hired to play

229
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,690
the skeptic that puts people's lives in

230
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:15,370
danger and that the filmmaker saw jaws

231
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:18,600
several times before making this movie

232
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,830
it's always been the fashion also

233
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,240
covering up a haunting is only like the

234
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,650
sixth most dangerous Catholic Church

235
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,060
cover-up which is gonna walk away from

236
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,250
it isn't that exactly what you did after

237
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,900
you got bothered by some flies we can

238
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,400
add show off to the list of possession

239
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,990
symptoms the windows in this house were

240
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:33,430
built with razor blades in the kids

241
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:35,200
reaction to living in this house is

242
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,400
phantom blood seeing that it keeps

243
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,110
disappearing and reappearing no one

244
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:39,910
broken bone am I missing something

245
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:41,470
did it really slam down on him that hard

246
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:43,240
and if it did is no one questioning why

247
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,920
this window fell with a force much

248
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,960
greater than gravity I don't

249
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,150
you stay up here like hell yeah why

250
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:50,590
would she want to stay upstairs that's

251
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:52,419
where her own children are I checked all

252
00:07:52,419 --> 00:07:54,250
the windows down in I'm broken and by I

253
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,750
checked all the windows he means looked

254
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:59,190
at one of them while he walked away

255
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:02,440
forever it's amazing to me that demons

256
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,970
and movies enjoy talking to children and

257
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:05,319
telling them their hopes and dreams for

258
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,699
some reason this George is just feeling

259
00:08:06,699 --> 00:08:07,990
super badass because he rode his

260
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:09,669
motorcycle today why steal this library

261
00:08:09,669 --> 00:08:10,870
book when you could just check it out

262
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:13,110
for free just know what I'm telling you

263
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:17,860
Jesus write a letter also did the

264
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,389
spirits keep Delaney from speaking and

265
00:08:19,389 --> 00:08:21,220
scramble the phone that we've never seen

266
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,720
actually work one or the other both

267
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,440
seems like overkill Cathy doesn't just

268
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,610
pack up the kids and drive to church

269
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:31,630
just someone taking glass harp lessons

270
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:33,370
in the living room everybody wanted to

271
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:34,870
come over to welcome you to the

272
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:35,380
neighborhood

273
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,000
who's this everybody he's talking about

274
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,950
him and the miller lite this guy might

275
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,149
be the scariest thing we've seen so far

276
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:41,940
I'm more worried about this potential

277
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,659
burglaries leaned his way into their

278
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:49,990
house look just like that kid kid last

279
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,700
year to kill this family you know the

280
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,170
house down by the river does the house

281
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:58,570
only haunt people who look the same

282
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:01,029
Jodie allows Amy to sing a Bible him

283
00:09:01,029 --> 00:09:05,529
without locking her in a closet it

284
00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:06,940
barely tried to alter the music from the

285
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,560
psycho shower scene apparently Jodie is

286
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,779
a Jawa those fall flies at the wrong

287
00:09:10,779 --> 00:09:12,640
time of year I'd argue that room

288
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,110
shouldn't be full of flies at any time

289
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:14,500
of year

290
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,959
I'm very sensitive about these things I

291
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:19,630
know about that's the great thing about

292
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:21,130
having a sixth sense regarding the

293
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:22,750
spiritual realm you can't be foolish and

294
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,250
no one will ever know it could have

295
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,860
climbed up the ivy I mean over the damn

296
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:29,010
house no it's not

297
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:31,060
what is possessing this woman to tear

298
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,589
down the wall all of a sudden she

299
00:09:32,589 --> 00:09:33,940
absolutely did not want to go near the

300
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,649
house earlier did the demon who doesn't

301
00:09:35,649 --> 00:09:36,880
want anyone in the house possessed her

302
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,620
to do this did father Delaney who

303
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:39,790
clearly doesn't want her to do this

304
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:43,160
possess her to do this I mean

305
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,529
kind of go through here so why the

306
00:09:46,529 --> 00:09:47,970
sudden urge to break down the wall that

307
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:51,600
they come and go freely well this

308
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,190
obviously possessed chick proves to be

309
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:59,790
no concern to anyone in this room answer

310
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,050
the goddamn phone after less than eight

311
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:02,370
rings for once this is what you could

312
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:03,390
get away with an old horror movies

313
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:06,709
satanic prank calls

314
00:10:06,709 --> 00:10:08,880
new homeowners should expect a little

315
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,100
DIY but do it yourself demon expelling

316
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,360
usually works best with a licensed

317
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:18,000
contractor or priest this is a really

318
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,410
bizarre way to blind someone good the

319
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,820
demon not just come in and Three Stooges

320
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,740
style poke him in the eyes also that's

321
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:27,570
it he stays blind forever same one isn't

322
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:30,860
God damming your house the whole problem

323
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,730
shouldn't you know by this point that

324
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:36,660
it's demons this is the best idea she's

325
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,450
had so far

326
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:41,070
sister act 3 goal tending the flock the

327
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:42,180
demons finally did it

328
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,320
they made father Delaney fully

329
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,390
transitioned to Darth Sidious certainly

330
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,920
is beautiful here way to rub it in

331
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,320
father killjoy oh there's no story to

332
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,940
get it right this guy basically just

333
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:55,260
summed up the entire movie charge this

334
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,029
must be entirely coincidental unless the

335
00:10:57,029 --> 00:10:58,260
demons were all just amusing themselves

336
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,240
by luring a guy who looked just like the

337
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,800
last guy to buy the house then kill his

338
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,149
entire family it's a good thing Kathi

339
00:11:03,149 --> 00:11:04,290
figured out George looked like that

340
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:05,730
other dude who killed his family on the

341
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:07,200
very night the devil told George to

342
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,850
start killing his family coincidentally

343
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:09,990
this pig creature was gonna be what

344
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:11,430
possessed Rick Moranis and Ghostbusters

345
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:12,779
but Harold Ramis had enough self-respect

346
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:14,520
to make a different choice copy down the

347
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,079
bathroom door and a fit of ghost induced

348
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,970
madness was kind of the cellphone loses

349
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,620
signal at crucial moment of its day was

350
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,700
she really in the rain long enough to

351
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,380
get that brownie there was no hope that

352
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,820
Greg would get down these stairs without

353
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,589
falling he can't even handle dry stairs

354
00:11:25,589 --> 00:11:27,959
also I'm still not 100% on the demons

355
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:29,310
motivations here they went more dead

356
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:30,779
spirits haunting the house or do they

357
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:32,070
want them to leave they wanted him to

358
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:33,449
leave they should have just gushed blood

359
00:11:33,449 --> 00:11:34,800
out of the walls on day one it's very

360
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,980
effective

361
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,120
after all it was very common for people

362
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,800
in the 70s to leave their keys in the

363
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,420
ignition in case of haunting this is the

364
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,710
gateway to hell and why is George just

365
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:47,120
able to climb up out of the black is

366
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,130
hell is just a pool of goopy black stuff

367
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:50,300
I'm not too worried about going there

368
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:50,780
anymore

369
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,820
end of movie reading also wait a minute

370
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,140
happened in this movie

371
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,520
George was clearly the dude who killed

372
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,690
his family at the beginning of the movie

373
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:58,550
and how did he get out of jail and what

374
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:00,170
made him forget about his past and what

375
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:02,060
was this demon was it Satan worshiper

376
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,410
John Ketchum or was it the fact that the

377
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:04,430
house was built on an Indian burial

378
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:10,840
ground and what happened to the priest

379
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:14,230
you yell Barracuda devices

380
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:17,480
you yell shark we've got a panic on our

381
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,640
hands on the 4th of July got a real

382
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,320
attitude problem and fly you're a

383
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,290
slacker remind me of your father when he

384
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:26,840
went here he was a slacker tool well

385
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,340
you're gonna be very happy it's a

386
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,530
wonderful house Marge Simpson sold her

387
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:34,290
first house the manor house

388
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:42,340

I think Marvel's gonna whack again Ma

390
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:49,870
Bell I got the ill communication the ill

391
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:52,080
communication must show you this

392
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,180
lickable wallpaper for nursery walls

393
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,290
lick an orange

394
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:57,730
it tastes like an orange like a

395
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:03,300
pineapple it tastes like a pineapple

396

[Music]

397
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,999
we have in fact caught and killed a

398
00:13:14,999 --> 00:13:17,579
large predator that's supposedly injured

399
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:19,410
some bathing's but it you see it's

400
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:21,839
beautiful day the beaches are open and

401
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:30,600
people having a wonderful time the walls

402
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,059
in the 53rd precinct were bleeding how

403
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:35,000
