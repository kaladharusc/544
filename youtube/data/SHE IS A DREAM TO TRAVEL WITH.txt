no one is staring at their cell phones Oh side

42
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:44,159
crazy right no one there's also no billboards and there are no

43
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:49,169
advertisements and there's no like coca-cola signs or no paint on

44
00:04:49,169 --> 00:05:04,349
no pay phones but everybody is exactly the same

45
00:05:05,099 --> 00:05:08,099

53
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,960
we're still terribly terribly lost

54
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:56,510
we're having fun and getting a little concern still very

55
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:00,610
very long

56
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,880
I think we found our hotel

57
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:15,100
I've got to be it right that fancy building was not our hotel

58
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:18,100
this has gotta do this

59
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,760
look there they are

60
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:30,130
whoa

61
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:36,010
we made it back to the hotel about an hour and a half ago we got to the room

62
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:38,950
immediately passed out and we just woke up

63
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:43,120
we are an hour plus late for this kind of fancy dinner we're supposed to go to

64
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,250
we definitely missed the buses

65
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:48,610
we're going to take a taxi there now not sure what to expect

66
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:52,180
I'm not gonna bring this camera

67
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:03,669
is this it
