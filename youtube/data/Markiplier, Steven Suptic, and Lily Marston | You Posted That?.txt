1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,580
Ian: Mark, you tweeted:

2
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:04,160
&quot;Is it too late for me to become a *blank*?

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,840
Steven: Member of ISIS?

4
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:09,900
*laughter*

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,860
?You posted that? *clap, clap*?

6
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:14,040
?Embarrassing things from your past *clap, clap*?

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,400
?Instagram, Twitter, but not Snapchat!?

8
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,240
?You posted that? *clap, clap*?

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,380
Shayne: Welcome to 'Who posted that?'!

10
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:25,700
And here is your host, dollar store Chris Hardwick, Ian Hecox!

11
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:30,360
*cheering, clapping*

12
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,720
Ian: Hello, hello! Welcome to 'You posted that?'.

13
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,400
The show, where we force our guests to face their online pasts.

14
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,860
Let's meet our guests!

15
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:40,940
She's the host of Beauty Break.

16
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:45,600
And also, her favourite beer is corse light and I'm judging her harshly.

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,360
It's Lily Marston!

18
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,600
*Cheering, clapping*

19
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,160
Next up, the lesbian from SugarPine7

20
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,880
Steven Suptic!

21
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:01,700
*More cheering and clapping*

22
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:05,700
And finally! The man with the deepest voice on the internet,

23
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,560
whose dog is way cuter than he is.

24
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,720
Markiplier!

25
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,860
(Wow he doesn't look amused)

26
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:13,100
Mark: It's fine, it's very fine.

27
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,300
Ian: Alright guys, if you don't know how this goes,

28
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,500
which I'm guessing you don't because you probably didn't watch the previous videos.

29
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,360
Shayne: *laughing*

30
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,880
Ian: The game consists of three rounds,

31
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,600
during which we're going to dive deep into your social media

32
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,040
and find all the little tasty morsels.

33
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,640
And, uh, what do they get, Shayne?

34
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,660
Shayne: Oh, uh, we don't have the trophy here.

35
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:29,960
Ian: We don't have the trophy here?

36
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,720
Ian: Well, hold on. I'm gonna snap my fingers, and it's gonna appear in you hand, ready?

37
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,520
Shayne: Okay.

38
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,640
Oh my gosh!

39
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,420
Keith: That's nice!

40
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,680
Shayne: Award for the high school football running back champion!

41
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,680
Ian: Wow!

42
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,620
*Cheering, clapping*

43
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:47,240
Ian: You go all out for our contestants.

44
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:47,740
Shayne: Yep!

45
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,560
Ian: Well let's jump right into round one, shall we?

46
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,260
You. Posted. That.

47
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:55,360
*Cheering and clapping again*

48
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,860
Ian: I'm going to present each of you with a tweet from the past.

49
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:02,620
And there'll be one or more words missing from that tweet

50
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,920
It's your job to guess what is in that blank.

51
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,960
If you get it right, you have five points.

52
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,660
So let's get to the first one, shall we?

53
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,180
Lily, you're up first.

54
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:12,000
Lily: Can't wait.

55
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,020
Ian: On October 22nd, 2017 you tweeted the following:

56
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:20,820
&quot;It took hours but my *blank* is clean and I'm thrilled.&quot;

57
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,360
Shayne: We liked this!

58
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,920
Lily: Let's go with 'my room is clean'.

59
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,340
It's very rare but I think it occasionally happens and it's worthy enough to tweet.

60
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,240
Ian: Is it 'room'?

61
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,620
Yes!

62
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,300
*Clapping, cheering x6*

63
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,020
Ian: Well done! Lily, that is five points for you!

64
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,760
Next up! Mark.

65
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,620
Are you ready?

66
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,400
Mark: Yes.

67
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,180
Ian: On August 5th, 2017 you tweeted:

68
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,300
&quot;Is it too late for me to become a *blank*?&quot;

69
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,740
Steven: Member of ISIS?

70
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:55,620
*laughing*

71
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:00,320
Mark: My brain now thought, maybe stripper?

72
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:00,880
Ian: Oh.

73
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,500
Are you going with stripper?

74
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,420
Mark: Yes.

75
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,460
Ian: Is it stripper?

76
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:04,960
I swear to god if its

77
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,120
No!

78
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,400
Blacksmith.

79
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,580
Mark: That's so much more boring.

80
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:12,660
Ian: You could be a stripper blacksmith, it might be kinda dangerous, but-

81
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,920
Mark: I'd burn my dick off.

82
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,800
Ian: Let's move on to the next one.

83
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,340
*Laughter* lol

84
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:19,380
Steven, on April 19th, 2017 you tweeted:

85
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:22,240
&quot;Sick of people *blank* shaming me.&quot;

86
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,840
Steven: Oh god, um...

87
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,180
What the f*ck could this be?

88
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,480
*laughter* (people laughing for absolutely nothing)

89
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,500
Steven: I feel like I wouldn't just go with, you know

90
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,000
'slut shaming', because it's-, it's weak.

91
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,420
That would be a weak tweet.

92
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,060
Shayne: That one got 1.5k likes, so-

93
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,580
Steven: Yeah, I'm gonna say 'slut'.

94
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:38,900
*laughter*

95
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,060
Ian: Is it 'slut'?

96
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,100
No, it's 'fart'!

97
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,220
'Fart shaming'.

98
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,580
Steven: That wasn't a good tweet.

99
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,060
Ian: It's your fault, not ours, sorry.

100
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:48,940
Steven: For sure, yeah.

101
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:52,040
*laughter*

102
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,580
Ian: Lily, on February 21st, 2018 you said:

103
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:59,840
&quot;Why do high school movies always try to make the *blank* look bad?

104
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,680
*Blank* are f*cking great!&quot;

105
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,060
Lily: I absolutely know the answer to this, because I was so passionate about it.

106
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:10,700
&quot;Why did they try to make sloppy joes look bad? Sloppy joes are f*cking great!&quot;

107
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:13,480
*Cheering, clapping x7* (some kid screaming in the backround)

108
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,060
Ian: Got some SJ fans in the audience.

109
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,640
Let's see, is it 'sloppy joes'?

110
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,540
Yes!

111
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,220
*Cheering, clapping x8*

112
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,500
Ian: Lily, another five points for you!

113
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,880
Well done.

114
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,300
Mark, on February 1st, 2018 you said:

115
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,060
I've been up since 4-, oh sorry.

116
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:33,600
*imitates Mark's super deep voice* &quot;I've been up since 4am, I've already recorded and edited all of my videos.&quot;

117
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,040
Mark: I'm right here!

118
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,500
Ian: *continues in deep voice* &quot;I've already worked out today. Get f*cked, *blaaaaaank*&quot;

119
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,700
Mark: That wasn't even close. (mark is incorrect that voice was amazing)

120
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:46,020
Ian: I'm sorry. I just sounded like, probably just like Gandalf.

121
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,520
Mark: Oh, it's procrastic*nts.

122
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,140
*hysterical laughter* (ear rape 2.0)

123
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,780
Ian: I'm sorry, what?

124
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,940
Mark: Isn't it procrastic*nts?

125
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,260
Isn't that what I said?

126
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:58,060
Ian: Isn't it *mumbles* 'procrastinmn'?

127
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,780
*from the background* I love that word.

128
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:00,760
Ian: Yes!

129
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,440
*cheering, clapping x9*

130
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,580
*Mark shows thumbs up*

131
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:07,120
Ian: Alright Steven, on February 28th, 2018 you tweeted:

132
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,020
&quot;It's five am and I'm just lying in bed looking up

133
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,900
the rarest types of *blank* and I'm pretty worried.&quot;

134
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:18,140
Steven: I've been on a streak of just before I go to bed, I'll look up, you know, top five most dangerous animals.

135
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:21,420
Or like, top five most dangerous types of crocodiles.

136
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:21,920
*Lily's 'what?' face*

137
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,100
Steven: Or like, most dangerous kinds of sharks.

138
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,780
This one's 'rocks', though.

139
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:31,060
Ian: Is it *laughs* rocks?

140
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,520
Yes!

141
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,280
*cheering, clapping  x10*

142
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,240
Steven: And there are a lot of really cool rocks out there!

143
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,240
Ian: Well done. Steven, that get's you five points.

144
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,120
And that is the end of round one!

145
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,740
*cheering, clapping x456*

146
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:46,380
Ian: Currently, we've got Mark with five points, good job!

147
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,700
Steven with five points, good job!

148
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,420
And Lily, you're killin' it with 10 points!

149
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,540
Steven: *in Lily's voice* Stahp it!

150
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:56,380
Ian: Before we get to round two, let's bring down the mood a little bit.

151
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,500
Get it sexy.

152
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,380
Lily: Ooh!

153
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:01,220
Ian: And hear a nice little song from our boys Keith and Scotty.

154
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,760
Keith: It's time to TURN UP!

155
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:14,320
*sick beats*

156
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:20,460
(So awkward ;D)

157
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,220
*Embarrassed laughter*

158
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:26,600
*cheering, clapping x12*

159
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,720
Ian: On to round two.

160
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,920
'Is this funny?'

161
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,960
Shayne: Oh- oh.

162
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,320
Ian: In this round we're going to look at some jokes you guys have posted.

163
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:35,880
And, uh-

164
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,760
Steven: It's a great idea for a game.

165
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,560
*laughter*

166
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,980
Ian: Thanks, that's why we made a game out of it!

167
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,100
*more laughter*

168
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,860
Ian: So, you're gonna see some tweets that you guys have posted on here.

169
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:48,400
And you're gonna have to vote on if you think it was funny, *thumbs up*, or not funny *thumbs down*.

170
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,300
The names will be hidden so you don't know who posted that.

171
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:58,220
And once you vote, that person will be revealed and if the majority deems that tweet funny

172
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:01,820
they'll get five points. If the majority deems that tweet not funny then they will get no points.

173
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:02,660
'Cause they're not funny.

174
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,060
This person said:

*laughter*

177
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,760
Ian: That got a very polite chuckle.

178
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:16,460
So, was that funny *thumbs up*, or not funny *thumbs down* *laughter in the background*

179
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,060
Let's put out dem hands!

183
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,300
Good job, Mark!

184
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,260
Steven: Oh my god, I am so sorry Mark, I had thought that was mine!

185
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,680
Mark: Oh no, that's fine. I didn't remember that.

186
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,480
*laughing*

187
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,420
Ian: That's five points for you, buddy!

188
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,140
Mark: Yay!

189
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,260

Ian: I wonder why..

196
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,420

197

00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:10,900
*laughing*

207
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,300

Let's see who said that.

213
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,980
Ah, Steven.

214
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,340
Steven: We can't all be winners.

215
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:27,840
Lily: I think it just shows that I have a a very low standard of humor.

216
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,060
Steven: I played very fair I gave everyone a thumbs down, including me.

217
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:33,580

Mark: Is that a joke?

222
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:48,320
*laughing*

223
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,220
Steven: Did you actually meet Katy Perry?

224
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,640
Lily: And she told me I was funny three times!

225
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,720
Mark: Three times in the same sentence or just like-

226
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,380
Lily: It was throughout the ten minute meet and greet I had with her.

227
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,440
Mark: Ooh.

228
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,720
It's- It's not really a joke, so- *shrug* *thumbs down*

229
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,160
Ian: So if it's not really a joke you don't find it funny?

230
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,720
Mark: I can't really vote for it.

231
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,760
Ian: Steven, you're thumbs down or thumbs up?

232
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,280
Steven: *thumbs down*

233
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,260
Lily you're thumbs-?

234
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,020
Lily: *confused thumbs up*

235
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,820
Ian: Oh, alright. Let's see who posted that.

236
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,320
Lily!

237
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,680
Lily: It's really fine, like I got to meet Katy Perry and she told me I was funny, so-

238
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,860
Shayne: You're a really great comedian.

239
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:20,360

*reads tweet*

242
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,240
Ian: Is that tweet hilarious?

243
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,640
Steven: Would be better if it ended at 'this isn't a joke'.

244
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,760
Mark: Yeah. By my own judgement in the previous one, I have to. *thumbs down* It's not a joke.

245
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,820
Ian: Well, it's not called 'Is this a joke', it's called 'Is this funny'.

246
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,180
Mark and Steven: Oh.

247
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,940
Lily: I think we need to go back one then!

248
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:46,980
Mark: Then I can change my ruling. *thumbs up*

249
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,400
Steven: But to counter that... *thumbs down*

250
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,000
Lily: *thumbs down*

251
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,200
Mark: Fair. Fair.

252
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,380
Ian: *laughs* Let's see who posted that.

253
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,040
Mark!

254
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,040
I hope your eye has recovered.

255
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,280
Lily: Are you scarred by pickles now?

256
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,720
Mark: No, I love them.

257
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,600
Ian: So let's move on to the last tweet of this round!

258
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,800
This person said:

259
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:10,320

Steven: I've got banned from chess.com twice.

263
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,180
Shayne: Really?

264
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:17,720
Steven: I swear to god, dude.

265
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,240
Lily: Something no one else's ever said.

266
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,860
Now let's see, thumbs up or thumbs down?

267
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,460
Everyone give up your thumbs!

268
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:26,120
Steven: Well it doesn't matter about me at this point so I don't look like an a**hole.

269
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,560
Ian: Okay. Well let's see who it is!

270
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,800
Yeah, good job Steven!

271
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,180
Well done!

272
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:35,260
Well that is the end of round two.

273
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:42,400
And guys we, for the first time I think in You Posted That? history possibly, are tied all the way across at the end of round two!

274
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,680
Well done! *claps*

275
00:10:43,680 --> 00:20:13,000
