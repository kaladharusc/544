1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:06,569
Starship Troopers was a movie. I watched when I was eight years old and I thought it was a pretty cool sci-fi movie

2
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:09,610
but what I didn't know was that it was one of the most

3
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:14,469
misunderstood movies ever. my eight-year-old self will be completely

4
00:00:14,469 --> 00:00:21,250
surprised. Starship troopers a dumb space war movie Starship Troopers a brilliant satire of military propaganda

5
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:27,130
Starship Troopers a movie that misunderstood the novel he was parodying and then got misunderstood for what it was parodying Starship Troopers

6
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:29,560
war is stored in the balls

7
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,680
Hello everybody it's me

8
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:38,500
Lately, there's been a lot more articles talking about Starship Troopers as in the light of we got it all wrong

9
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:45,680
How could we have been so blind you're all a bunch of fools, you do not understand. It was a joke Wow

10
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,320
I'm DoiNg mY paRt

11
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,760
I'm DoiNg mY paRt

12
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,880
I'm DoiNg mY paRt

13
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,240
I'm DoiNg-- your mom

14
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,000
(Adults laughing at a 9 year old)

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,160
Maybe in retrospect. It's easy to point out. How overly the top the satire is but

16
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:06,520
Looking back at reviews at the time, It seems like a lot of people just didn't get it. The exact words are the text

17
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,740
But do you understand it?

18
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:23,660
Do you believe it? So what really is being misunderstood here and why? let's investigate. Would you like to know more?

19
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,440
(The making of Pewds army of 9 year olds)

20
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:32,380
Citizens rule people making a better tomorrow

21
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:35,720
 

22
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:42,680
The movie starts off with these military propaganda films and it's really during these times that it should have been obvious

23
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,560
They're basically spelling out for us

24
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,760
Heyyy

25
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,299
It's satire

26
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:51,530
the story follows John Rico and Carmen Ibanez

27
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:56,880
I mean just a look at these two, these characters look like they came straight out of a Beverly Hills TV show and

28
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,640
That's the point

29
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,340
Rumor has it that the director purposely selected these

30
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:09,329
Actors to just look that part to make war look attractive and all these pretty people are fighting

31
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:17,099
This idea is also reinforced through just how the film looks it's not your ordinary, Gritty alien type of sci-fi.

32
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:22,440
It's-it looks and it's shot like a high school rom-com from the 90s

33
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:28,920
During one of their final classes, The teacher is explaining why only what's called citizens are allowed to vote

34
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:35,099
Why are only citizens allowed to vote but we're not really listening because we're distracted by the flirting and playfulness

35
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:41,180
Between Rico and his girlfriend they've seen as a perfect example on how this movie could get over people's head

36
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:45,260
Despite at times feeding the message over you with a stick

37
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,900
I dunno

38
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:52,820
When school is over they sign up for their military duty to become citizens

39
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:56,160
But before breaking apart, they make a promise to stay together

40
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:56,940
Let's make a vow

41
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,600
 

42
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:02,280
No matter what, we'll always be friends (I saw what you did there)

43
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,400
Rico joins the infantry force

44
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:12,480
Ibanez joins to Starfleet during one of Rico's training exercises, He pushes it too far and an accident occurs

45
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,740
 

46
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:17,440
 

47
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,940
Medic!!!!

48
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,720
(Pewds chuckling)

49
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,960
Medic!!!!

50
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,280
Pretty sure he's dead mate, pretty sure

51
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:37,680
to break down the story to the bare minimal, when Osiris gets destroyed in an alien attack &quot;Buenos Aires has been wiped off the Earth&quot;

52
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,080
Ibanez ends up with another guy she meets at Starfleet.

53
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,700
 

54
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:53,140
and Rico ends up with another girl that was all over him during high school. During the attack of alien space planet she then dies

55
00:03:53,140 --> 00:04:00,880
Very tragic along with Ibanez new boyfriend who gets his brain sucked out. We don't need to show that

56
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,280
Honestly, it's pretty gross

57
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:10,060
the brain bug gets captured and since it controls all the other bugs the battle has been won and they reached a

58
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,620
amazing conclusion that

59
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:19,720
&quot;It's aFraiD&quot;

60
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:24,319
It's afraid, it's afraid everybody who would have thought

61
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:30,940
So there they are together back again just like in the beginning but they're really not with who they want to be

62
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,980
It's more of a well, I guess our

63
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:41,360
Boyfriend and girlfriend died. So here we are and the message of the stories and all we won the war is over. It's

64
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,629
We won but we must keep fighting any

65
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:53,990
Banas and Rico is the figurehead of this next generations of Fighters. Just like it will just keep going and keep going

66
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:57,110
Come on you Ape!! you wanna live forever???

67
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:00,729
When the movie came out it got terrible reviews and ratings in America

68
00:05:00,729 --> 00:05:04,240
We were accused by the Washington Post of being neo-nazis

69
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,110
The director says, also pointing out how in England they seem to have understand the joke

70
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:12,759
This movie is meant to be an exaggeration of America they're

71
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:18,830
We are always right attitude to war which is probably why it flopped in the US and was a hit

72
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:24,979
Everywhere else in the world. One of the reviews that I could found that gave it two stars said this want to know more

73
00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:26,199
Yes, I did

74
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:28,509
I was particularly intrigued by the way

75
00:05:28,509 --> 00:05:35,719
the bugs had evolved organic launching pods that could spit their spores into space and could also fire big globs of

76
00:05:35,719 --> 00:05:40,640
Unidentified fury matter at the attacking spaceships since they have no technology

77
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:48,680
These abilities must have evolved along Darwinian lines to say this severely tested theory of evolution is putting it mildly

78
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:53,020
This is the point of the film if you look at the attack of Buenos Aires

79
00:05:53,020 --> 00:06:01,340
First of all, that guy is not from Buenos Aires

80
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:06,669
You see the footage of the meteor you see the fires you see all the things you don't see any bugs

81
00:06:06,669 --> 00:06:14,050
You don't see any evidence of an actual attack. The Society of Starship Troopers is completely dependent on war to function

82
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:16,870
They and therefore they need an enemy to function

83
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:19,500
and for example when the meteor attacks

84
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,920
Rico is more sure than ever that he wants to fight against the bug when in reality

85
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:30,640
it was probably just a regular meteor a movie like this will probably never exist today because of how

86
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:37,319
Carefully edited and selected they are by the studios and I do think it's a fantastic film and if you haven't seen it

87
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:42,129
I definitely recommend watching it and and maybe it's time for a rewatch as well

88
00:06:42,129 --> 00:06:48,729
But there's another side of the story that seemed a lot of times untold the book while

89
00:06:48,729 --> 00:06:54,520
99% of movies based off novels that tend to be as close as possible to resemble its source material

90
00:06:54,520 --> 00:07:01,020
To appease fans or the author this films basically pulls down its pants and unloads their biggest dump

91
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,719
It could possibly give on this novel

92
00:07:03,719 --> 00:07:09,539
The only thing the movie really borrows from the novel list of bugs and the names of the characters in the novel

93
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:12,189
In fact, there's barely any action in it

94
00:07:12,189 --> 00:07:20,139
there's only really one fight and the director of the filming said said that I stopped after two chapters because it was so

95
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:22,710
Boring, it is really quite a bad book

96
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:29,680
I asked Edie Newmeyer to tell me the story because I just couldn't read the thing this kind of annoys me or

97
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:35,039
Anyone being a fan of the novel really because despite me maybe not agreeing with everything

98
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,039
The novel says it has a lot of interesting things to say

99
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:45,069
It's basically a parody that got misunderstood and it still misunderstood what he was trying to parody

100
00:07:45,069 --> 00:07:52,659
So are we back at this source material? I've never seen anything like this. It's so weird. It's so confusing

101
00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:59,860
Highland the author's politics are difficult to point to because a lot of times he just seemed to enjoy playing around with ideas

102
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,800
There without a doubt provocative

103
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:09,969
but that's what make this a classic novel Heinlein wrote Starship Troopers because he thought America was getting soft and the bugs is flat-out a

104
00:08:09,969 --> 00:08:16,659
description of a communist society if you're looking for an epic space sci-fi battle of man between bugs

105
00:08:16,659 --> 00:08:19,409
Reading this you'll definitely be disappointed

106
00:08:19,409 --> 00:08:25,559
Here's some themes that was discussed in the novel when the teacher in the beginning scene that talks about civic duty

107
00:08:25,559 --> 00:08:30,870
He discusses that anything that is given to you has no inherent value if it's given for free

108
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:34,829
Which is why only what is known as citizens is allowed to vote

109
00:08:34,829 --> 00:08:41,500
You could give someone an award without having them to work for it, but it wouldn't be worth the same to that person

110
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,120
hyaline felt the same about voting

111
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,030
It shouldn't just be handed down to you democracy is something we fought for?

112
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:49,850
But you won't appreciate it if it's handed down for free

113
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:54,100
I'm not saying I endorse his idea of having to perform military service to vote

114
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:58,100
But seeing how younger people are less and less inclined to vote

115
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:02,480
Pokemons going to the polls isn't really making anyone go to the polls

116
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,730
The teacher also discusses violence and importance of it in this society

117
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:10,220
Something given has no

118
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:14,270
Value look when you vote you are exercising political

119
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:16,900
Authority you're using force and force

120
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,620
My friends is violence

121
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:26,630
When the movie depicts violence as the ultimate source of conflict solver you laugh because it's silly it's dumb and it's over-the-top

122
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:30,980
But I wonder what the city fathers of Hiroshi would say about that

123
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,600
you

124
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:39,740
They probably wouldn't say anything Hiroshi mo was destroyed, correct?

125
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,930
What the fuck

126
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:47,630
Actually, why laughing we're turning a blind eye into history and maybe then it's not so funny

127
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:50,710
Punishment is a very long important part of the novel

128
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:58,210
It explains House punishment is vital to this society that we learned right and wrong from punishment man has no moral instinct

129
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:03,350
He is not born with moral sense. You were not born with it. I was not and a puppy has none

130
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:09,050
We acquire moral sense when we do through training experience and hard sweat of the mind

131
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:13,900
Last but not least the novel makes a very long case for why you should join the military

132
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:19,250
It feels like Heinlein wrote this to inspire young people and that Rico's character growth

133
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:25,010
Going from a boy to a man is a reflection of his own the novel makes a case. That veterans should run

134
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:27,650
Society because they know what's best for mankind

135
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:35,060
They can make decisions that are tough where one person gets to suffer for the better of the masses while in today in our society

136
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:43,040
We're hyper focused on individuals the outcry of one person could have a massive effect on everyone

137
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,240
 

138
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:54,110
I directed the Department of Defense and Pentagon to immediately begin the process necessary

139
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:57,170
to establish a space force

140
00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:02,899
as the sixth branch of the Armed Forces we must have

141
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:06,889
American dominance in space.

142
00:11:06,889 --> 00:11:13,040
A lot of us look at war today as something that we moved away from we avoid it because we know better now

143
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,720
But do we really?

144
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,240
The society and starship troopers needed war for its society to function

145
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:24,800
But within its context it might even be justified but within ours

146
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,980
maybe not pffft
