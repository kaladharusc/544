1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,770
good right so what we're not allowed to

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:04,460
skateboard here at all might need a perm

3
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:06,480
meeting they're so engrossed no

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,490
skateboarding what you can do and you

5
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,980
can't have a tripod or stand out so I

6
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,750
recommend because this is a state pride

7
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,759
I understand you go into the next Park

8
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:24,720
Battery Park

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,829
behind-the-scenes beginning now we have

10
00:00:26,829 --> 00:00:29,259
a lot to do not a lot of time I'm

11
00:00:29,259 --> 00:00:32,470
shooting with my friend Jesse a really

12
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:34,570
ridiculously awesome Halloween video

13
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:38,559
Jack over here is preparing the three

14
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,420
axis gimbal how's it coming it's coming

15
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:43,300
it's not coming this is the three axis

16
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:46,149
gimbal this thing makes everything look

17
00:00:46,149 --> 00:00:49,329
beautiful it provides like the craziest

18
00:00:49,329 --> 00:00:51,280
steadiest most amazing shots it's just

19
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,769
like it takes a little prep a little

20
00:00:53,769 --> 00:00:55,690
hard to use okay now I have to build our

21
00:00:55,690 --> 00:01:24,520
main prop before Jesse gets here

22
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,890
that's the frame there it's construction

23
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:28,720
is now complete I want to tape up all

24
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,950
the joints to make sure nothing

25
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:31,780
accidentally comes unplugged and then

26
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:45,600
we've to attach that to the skateboard

27
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,280
okay red tape reinforcement is done I'm

28
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:48,820
dizzy

29
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:51,909
man nothing up and running or Wat we're

30
00:01:51,909 --> 00:01:53,020
almost there it's all about the

31
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:55,960
stabilization is it stable

32
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:59,740
whoa in front Abel nice work what needs

33
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,780
to happen now I need a method to attach

34
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:04,450
this gigantic red frame to the boosted

35
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:07,170
board I'm going to appropriate these

36
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,519
mending plates here and bend them so

37
00:02:09,519 --> 00:02:11,290
they're fixed to the board and then the

38
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:13,570
frame can be popped on and off this is

39
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:22,140
going to require some custom metal work

40
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,180
I'm thinking this will do it I'm going

41
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,710
to attach this the booster board test it

42
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:28,260

just got attacked by all your gonna

96
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,210

stay in school

99
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,120
I think the battery is dead on the

100
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,030
skateboard I feel like we got it I think

101
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:15,380
there's some more shots we should get

102
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,570
but we're out of batteries across the

103
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:19,700
board I think you're gonna be surprised

104
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,440
I said how much good stuff we don't know

105
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,730
I looked at some of that photos it looks

106
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:27,290
amazing it's good it looks crispy but

107
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:28,880
the truth is we got everything we need

108
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,230
right now a hundred percent but that's

109
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,700
not the kind of guys we are we're gonna

110
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:38,980
push it so we're doing a costume change

111
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:41,270
Jesse's taking off the Aladdin outfit

112
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,400
I'm gonna be Jesse stunt double I'm

113
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,950
putting on you Latin outfit and Jesse

114
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,780
sending up the drone which is like

115
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:51,830
completely illegal in New York City is

116
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:54,080
gonna be good I know we did it no one's

117
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,540
gonna know I should slip back my hair

118
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:00,320
this morning to look more like Jesse we

119
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,790
are now in location as you can see I

120
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:04,640
assumed the role of Aladdin this is

121
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,950
we're going to fly the drone see we

122
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:09,050
can't risk people and we can't risk

123
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:09,830
arrest

124
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,240
so we're thinking this is fairly

125
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,590
discreet here we're gonna be able to get

126
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:14,930
the thing in the air how long did it

127
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:17,330
take you to get this thing up three

128
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:18,690
minutes

129
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:20,310
and then we got to talk to like where

130
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:21,930
you want me to go with the trajectory is

131
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:24,090
the whole thing okay let me take a lens

132
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:31,240
cap off the camera yeah

133
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:35,050
all right drone session here we go a few

134
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:37,479
moments later it was so scary because

135
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:39,850
with it with a drone it goes off beep

136
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:41,830
GPS signal to keep it stationary so if

137
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,750
the wind blows it stays there kept

138
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,729
losing it so the wind just would take it

139
00:07:45,729 --> 00:07:47,830
straight out of building I couldn't like

140
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,060
figure out which way I was going it was

141
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,710
scary so Jesse did you get the shot

142
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:54,340
gunshot love oh yeah a lot of people are

143
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,930
all looking at you I started losing

144
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:57,880
control right there I was like trying to

145
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,310
keep you in frame I'm like trying oh we

146
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:02,530
