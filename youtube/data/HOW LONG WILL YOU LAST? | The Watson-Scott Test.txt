4
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:14,110
deepest anxieties and the

5
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:15,549
UNDERLYING

6
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:18,900
causes... of... your...

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,060
DARKEST FEARS.

00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,480

00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:31,340

14
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,280
*Mark laughing*

15
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,400
Okay! Please note that typically

16
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,400
only 13% of

17
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,820
participants are able to

18
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,000
complete the test DUE to the

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,560
onset of

20
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,440
total body

21
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,300
paralysis OR UNANTICIPATED

22
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:13,140
cardiac arrest or UNANTICIPATED bowel explosions

23
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,380
Do you wish to continue?

24
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:16,840
IMMA GO

25
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:22,769
YEAH, I like the bowel explosion part. Make my entire intestines goosh out

26
00:01:22,769 --> 00:01:26,720
of my toosh. What? Firstly some calibration questions

27
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,939
How many minutes are there in ONE HOUR?

28
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:31,509
Oh, I know this one oh

29
00:01:31,509 --> 00:01:38,180
You think I don't know this one. Oh you silly bitch. I am a smart man. I dropped out of college.

30
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:43,960
If there are three oranges and I take away two, how many are left?

31
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,700
That depends on how much you put on the right

32
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:49,920
Hmm, imma go with one.

33
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,220
Are you playing a game right now?

34
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:58,180
I'm gonna go with a whole lot of yeah. I think I think I'm doing a let's play and by definition

35
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:01,840
There's got to be a game. Hang on I don't think this is spooky enough in here

36
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:07,240
And let's get this lets get maximum spoop going on. Three, two, one, spoop *THE SPOOP MUSIC*

37
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:12,052
Now we're talking here. Okay, yes I'm gonna go with yes. I believe yes.

38
00:02:12,052 --> 00:02:14,319
Are you sure it's a game?

39
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,459
Yeah

40
00:02:15,459 --> 00:02:19,420
Yeah, I'm pretty sure

41
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,960
Calibration complete

42
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:27,240
Your test will begin now. Okay you got it. I'm ready!

43
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:34,000
It's raining outside and you're walking in bare feet.

44
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:41,760
You take one step forward and crush a snail between your toes

45
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,240
You feel? I felt disgusted. BECH!

46
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,960
How? Why am I walking outside in the rain in bare feet?

47
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:55,150
And if I crush the snail between my toes, does that mean I picked it up with my toes

48
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:58,940
and squooshed it between my toesy-woseies? I'm gonna go disgusted.

49
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:01,240
There's a knock at your door.....

50
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:07,340
You open it to find an old woman in tattered clothes.

51
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,060
Huh!

52
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:14,680
She says she's being chased and wants to hide inside your home.

53
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,680
You...? Let her in!

54
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,400
Well come-  Well get h  er in!

55
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,620
Come on get her inside. Come on down, get her in!

56
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:27,240
Your pet cat drops a dead mouse on your front doorstep.

57
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,860
I don't like dis.  : ' &lt;

58
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:32,360
It's front legs are... missing

59
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:37,460
What, the mouse or the cat? Wait? The... The mouse? Or the cat?

60
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:44,400
Cuz if it's the cat, I'm kind of curious how it.. how it's... Is it just standing up on his two legs? I''d be proud!

61
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:50,560
If I had a cat that was missing its front legs but standing tall and proud and gets me that dead mouse, I'm proud.

62
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,880
I'm proud! I will now show you an image.

63
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,916
Uh-oh, please don't. I don't want this.

64
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:56,720
Please study it.

65
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,820
Okay? Here I go

66
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,680
The image will not move

67
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,340
Oh ho ho!

68
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:04,860
I don't like the fact that you had to preface it by saying it won't move.

69
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,980
Here we go, I'm ready!

70
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:11,160
Oh I don't like it

71
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:18,000
I don't like that. Here, Imma my amp up the spoop factor. I got a... I got a candle here

72
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,760
Let's really the candle... fire going .

73
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,340
How'd that image make you feel? ah.

74
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:30,260
I mean not any of these. I just didn't like it. I'm gonna go with anxious.

75
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,620
Uh-oh

76
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:36,910
Do you believe in ghosts?

77
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:39,200
Mm, nah, I don't think so. I'm good.

78
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,780
Have you ever seen a ghost?

79
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,830
No, no

80
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:47,260
No, I haven't... haven't seen one

81
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,920
Looking around my room right now.

82
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,780
Thinking about the room. (Oh no) you're in right now

83
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,440
Oh don't do that

84
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,420
Has anyone ever died here?

85
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:02,410
Well... If you count my career maybe you could call that dying here. But I

86
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:08,520
Not..*GIGGLE*. not yet not yet. Always be optimistic about the future. Not yet!

87
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,940
Yeah, I don't like this test.

88
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:16,080
How...

89
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,300
Unconventional.

90
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,620
Thank you. That's what I'm proud of.

91
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:29,080
Please indicate how strongly you agree or disagree with the following statements

92
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,100
Okay. I don't like this.

93
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,820
When I'm staring... * voice whispering in the background *

94
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,220
Wat dah DUCK?

95
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:40,200
&quot;When I'm staring at a screen. I completely forget about my surroundings&quot;

96
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,080
UH, I am looking very closely at my surroundings!

97
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:47,400
Excuse you. But I would tend to agree but not too strongly!

98
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,780
I'm looking around me. No I don't like that. You looking around you?

99
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:55,480
I often think about the ghosts inside my house

100
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,440
Heh, you're- You're very persistent about this old ghost thing.

101
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,280
I strongly disagree. I don't like this.

102
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,080
&quot;Some people deserve to die&quot;

103
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:11,080
*Hiss* Oh that's a hefty one, that's a hefty one, that's a hefty one. But you know there are certain circumstances

104
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:21,720
in certain circles at which I couldn't possibly be dictated to say all of the circumstances in which somebody could or could not die

105
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,940
*Spoopy noise in the background*  Go with  agree I guess...

106
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,720
Whohohhohoho

107
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:36,120
&quot;I would know if someone was trying to kill me&quot;

108
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,780
HUMMMM, I think I'm picking up a little hint right now. I think I'm good?

109
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:43,300
I think I'd know, I think I'd know

110
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:49,500
&quot;There is an unexpected guest in my HOUSE?!&quot;

111
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,980
You know with a big disagreed big disagree. I wish, I wish Chica was in here ri- *knocking*

112
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,040
*Inhales with fright*

113
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:02,520
Hey! Nobody would know if I went missing. Hey I THINK A LOT PEOPLE WOULD KNOW IF I WENT MISSING!

114
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,560
if I went missing

115
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:17,020
&quot;Poetry is the most intell-igent form of an artistic ex...&quot; *inhale*

116
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,000
*SCARED GROAN*

117
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:27,680
Depends on the poem but I'm generally gonna disagree with that. don't start singing no poems to me

118
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,880
&quot;You need an attitude readjustment&quot;

119
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,960
I don't need nothing! I've...

120
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:38,060
designed a new algorithm

121
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:46,280
For generating insightful poetry. let me demonstrate. okay

122
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,720
*Uneasy Mark Sounds*

123
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,240
Alright

124
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,560
Roses are red

125
00:07:53,560 --> 00:08:01,580
Silent as a mouse. There's somebody in my house! your door is unlocked

126
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:07,880
I'm inside your house I called it I knew it. I'm- I've read that poem before

127
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:17,080
congratulations only 41 percent of *starts nervous giggling* participants typically reach this point in the examination

128
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:23,300
From now on the questions will be much more intense. Do you wish to continue?

129
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,520
yeah come on bring it on

130

How far away is the closest police station?

132
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:45,360
*super high-pitched* Uhh.. I'm gonna, probably more than a 15 minute walk if I had to really...

133

135

None of that nah hey, I don't like the dick-etry that's happening here yes I do definitely and I'm double sure of that. Chica, Chica!

136
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:13,640
Compared to the average adult how fast can you run? I'm pretty quick, I'm pretty speedy, quick

137
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:18,960
I'm like I'm like sonic fast. I'm real- I'm real-I'm real speedy. I

138
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:30,600
Iiiii don't like that imagine you finished this test and you're lying in bed tonight

139
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,280
Attempting to sleep you understand that I'm inside your

140
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:39,820
*descending into anxiety* House and you hear me underneath your bed

141
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:45,440
ha joke's on you my bed doesn't have an underneath, its on the floor. I'm too lazy to get a bed frame.

142
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,140
You get up and look under the bed and I stab you in the eyes

143
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:52,960
Try to pretend you can't hear me or feel my presence but then. I stab you in the eyes.

144
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:58,520
Fall asleep... knowing that you'll wake up to me stabbing you in the eyes

145
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,620
* Marki Laughter* I'll just...

146
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:03,870
I'm just gonna go ahead and stab myself in the eyes

147
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:07,560
I'll jus- and I'll stab myself in the eyes with the eyes with the

148
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:13,220
Reverse of the knives so the blades are poking up and when you try to stab me I stab you

149
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:17,980
With my eyes that's how. I'm gonna beat you bitch yeah you think you're tougher than me? you and your second closest friend

150

You and your second closes-friend

151
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:25,180
Second closest? are stranded on a remote desert

152
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:28,600
Island after your plane crashed

153
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:35,820
in the ocean. I don't like the ocean. the nearest ship that can help you will arrive in one week

154
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:43,710
you have one more day of food and water before you will both

155
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:49,260
Die of starvation there is no other food around

156
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:56,420
do you...  Murder my second closest friend out of boredom and then wait to die; Wait until the food runs out and then murder my second closest friend out of spite;

157
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:59,499
Ration the food in an attempt to survive against all odds

158
00:10:59,499 --> 00:11:05,499
;walk ceremoniously into the ocean and drown. Okay so this is a dumb question if you had food left then you probably

159
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:11,519
Wouldn't be that close to starvation if you're one day away from starvation you don't have food

160
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,709
There's no food there so I'm gonna ration it out

161
00:11:14,709 --> 00:11:18,209
And we're gonna attempt to survive against all odds because that's pretty dumb

162
00:11:18,209 --> 00:11:22,440
I will now show you an image. great... please study it.

163
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:28,300
I will the image will not speak. I don't trust you.

164
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,900
Ooh.

165
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:30,400
*High Pitched* Ahhhh

166
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:35,769
Boy it's a spider I see a spider I think
 
 
11:28.8
 
Ooh.

167
00:11:35,769 --> 00:11:37,360
Okay

168
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,580
Thinking about the image, which phrase best

169
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,749
describes you?

170
00:11:43,749 --> 00:11:47,430
I am the redness; I'm the spider's eyes; I am the legs; I am the fear

171
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:54,519
I guess I looked at the eyes first so I guess I'm the spiders eyes. I'll ask this one more time

172
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:57,220
Are you playing a game...

173

176
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,780
*High Pitched* Noooo I don't know, I do not know I don't

00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:24,520
No, I speak the truth at all... times

180
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,440

211

216
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:39,179
Did you look away from your screen? I sure did! I did! yep

217
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:41,539
Yep, I did. hey there's no need to be rude here

218
00:14:41,539 --> 00:14:48,260
I sure did. do you think I can tell, when you look away from your screen?

219
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,780
Yes yes yes

220
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:53,180
*High Pitched* Mayyybeeeeeee?

Do you feel safe in your house right now? well Chica's not here. I'm unsure

222
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,480
*Nervous laughter*

223
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,640
*high pitched* Ah, you know

224

Hard- hard maybe on that one. are you having fun? I'm having a great time

225

I'm having the best time. I know when you're lying to me. Okay.

226
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:14,579
please ignore any external stimulus

227
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:19,160
Concentrate only on the screen. there are no unexpected

228
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:26,700
guests in your house. there are no unusual sounds coming from inside your house

229
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:30,320
Do not take your eyes off the screen

230
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,780
Do you understand? I'm...

231
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,880
Yesssssss

232
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,980

233
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:43,998
I Understand. yes. don't move or you may die. nobody knows when you perish. music can help us all relax

234
00:15:43,998 --> 00:15:46,919
*nervous cheering* what do I choose to do

235
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:52,679
All around the mulberry bush, monkey chase weasel, the monkey stopped to pull up his sock, pop goes the weasel pop goes weasel

236
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:58,340
Oh boy up and down the city Road in and out the eagle that's where the money goes uh oh

237
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:01,380
Hey! ohh

238
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:09,740
Hey! now that is not okay! every night when I go out the monkeys on the table Hawk coos a pa-ah!

239
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:13,400
*uncomfortably close breathing* Gah!

240
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:19,480
Okay that's his as just uncomfy it's like reverse ASMR

241
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:23,980
eh...oh

242
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,980
Did you just sniff in my ear?

243
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,520
WOAH

244
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:33,199
Okay, well that was weird test complete!

245
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:37,720
Thank you for your particip- I see-

246
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:43,980
Hey whoa, hey, oh hey wait a minute I see you

247
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,100
Are you upside-down

248
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:48,429
Oh, you're upside down aren't you hey well I would be upside-down but

249
00:16:48,429 --> 00:16:57,040
I'm not like that I survived the Watson Scott test. I lasted 18 minutes and 52

250
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,480
seconds

251
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,580
Heyy! my analysis!

252
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,340
Incurable narcissism

253
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:07,160
*laughing*

254
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:13,180
Susceptible to the influence of powerful people, has a firm handshake that sounds like me baby

255
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:17,500
When an old woman comes to my door I quickly invite her inside

256
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:23,080
I'm most afraid of what other people think of me

257
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:23,720
...eeeeehh

258
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,079
That's not true. that's not true but

259
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:33,280
I do have incurable narcissism and a firm handshake and I do invite old women inside my house on a regular

260
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:41,980
basis. The main test is complete there is a bonus test available

261
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:46,040
would you like to take it?

262
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:52,580
sure yeah go for it yeah go for it go for it baby come on very well oh very well indeed

263
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:56,500
The second test is designed to challenge your fear tolerance

264
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,690
Incorrect answers will be punished

265
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:02,420
Ignorance will be punished

266
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:09,360
Alright easy enough I can do that I must also admit that I have not run this test before there may be unexpected

267
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:15,160
malfunctions. Your answers will be used in the development of future tests

268
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,850
I'm good being a guinea pig I could do that I still see that face up there

269
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:24,080
I don't know how long you've been there oh, well. Complete this test as quickly as possible

270
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,800
for accurate resultsssss

271
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:38,420
But do not let that clock concern you it is nothing to be concerned about.

272
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:46,640
After the examination you will have a better sense of purpose and stronger resolve. I want you to be stronger

273
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,640
Thanks, baby you want to be stronger?

274
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,310
Oh hell yeah

275
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:55,960
My incurable narcissism says yes you got any old ladies around here? How many bones are there in a newborn

276
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:02,080
Baby, that I haven't met yet? I'm gonna go with 3 or 5

277
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,320
Ayyy!

278
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,400
0, 1, 1, 2...

279
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:12,820
what's next? Oh, this is the fibonacci sequence it's three easy-peasy you know, I'm- that is correct

280
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:20,680
I know it's correct you stupid idiot do you think you're smart? I am fucking genius level, it's Fibonacci a bitch

281
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,400
*narcissistic laugh*

282
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,150
showoff I know

283
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:24,110
fucking amazing

284
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:30,160
Must be my incurable narcissism and an addiction to old ladies. How many times per year does the average human heartbeat if it's

285
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,660
not stabbed

286
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:37,720
Okay if like average BPM is 60 per minute that's if you're pretty healthy...

287
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,640
times 60 would be

288
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:43,440
3,600 times 24... 7

289
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,580
*cue intense thinking music*

290
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:49,540
I'm gonna go 30 million

291
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:54,500
*cheering* Haaaahahahahaha

292
00:19:54,500 --> 00:20:01,450
One of the most venomous land snakes in Australia -- uh as opposed to the ocean snakes? -- the Death Adder bites an adult woman

293
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:07,840
injecting a highly deadly neurotoxin how long does the woman have to live guess like wouldn't be that fast

294
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:14,640
Just cause it's one of those venomous doesn't mean that it kills acutely it's probably closer to like six hours

295
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,730
Hey!

296
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:17,790
What the fuck I'm doing great

297
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:20,880
Oh, yeah a man is tied through a chair against his will

298
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,100
in a funnel he's placed inside his mouth

299
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:30,840
Pulverized pig intestines are poured in how much volume does a man's stomach hold before it ruptures let's see it's it's a

300
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,760
surp-surprising amount before it ruptures?

301
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:39,720
Probably be like 5 liters I mean you can drink you can't really drink a gallon, that's close but

302
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:44,060
I think five liters would be the limit

303
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,460
I'm so fucking smart

304
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:45,930
Okay

305
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:52,510
Look at me and how big my brain is you ain't gonna scare me, a fear of butterflies is called oh this I wouldn't know

306
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:58,960
Alektorophobia, Cibophobia,  Lepidopterophobia, that's a big word , I like that

307
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,190
Hey!

308
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:02,540
what the fuck! heh heh heh

309
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,940
heh heh heh!

310
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,800
heh HEH heh heh HEH!

311
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:10,650
Boy with no arms is facing west he walks forward for 60 seconds then enters 90 degrees left

312
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:14,910
He sees someone running at him so he turns 180 degrees and begins to run

313
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:19,320
Which way is the boy facing not a trick question okay, so he's facing west if he turns left

314
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,760
he's facing south then he's going north

315
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,650
Okay easy enough

316
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,870
Duh *slap sound*

317
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:27,370
Ok continue

318
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:31,560
That thing's counting down real fast, how do tapeworms enter their hosts?

319
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,370
larvae ingested by humans

320
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:38,040
That's an easy one. Please choose the third response this is not a trick

321
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:45,700
I will not scare you if you do what I say I am not lying, well I have

322
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:51,140
Yeah whatever okay, oh... yeah whatever

323
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:55,000
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

324
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,200
What is a positive electrode called?

325
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,440
Oh God I ran out time. Death?

326
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:03,520
Oh that's not good cathode anode oh god. I can't even remember

327
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,480
What this is I think it's a cathode?

328
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,360
Ah shit, well here comes a scare

329
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:16,640
Which was the best video game- what I wasn't punished. Uh game of the year 420 blaze it

330
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,640
*high/drunken laughing*

331
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,240
Am I dead yet? oh god what is my favorite. thing to do

332
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,540
Stab people in the eye!

333
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:25,880
Bathe and deer blood

334
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,960
Aww

335
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,740
The test is now complete. You result ah very-

336
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:34,660
*three loud knocks* ooh hello

337
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:37,800
Your participation was adequate

338
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,640
there are

339
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,520
no more tests

340
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,260
we are done here

341
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:46,400
for now

342
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,580
That's it? I'm so sick of watching I want to start participating... okay?

343
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,840
Goodbye!

344
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:57,320
Alright see ya then! alright, well that was the Watson Scott test

345
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:02,720
I'm happy about my results. I-I like that it really did provide a good

346
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,480
atmosphere it did make me kind of fear for the environment that I was in

347
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:11,920
But at the same time I think it relied on the same angle a little too much the whole &quot;I'm in your house

348
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,880
Look behind you!&quot; thing and I don't know if that would have changed if it

349
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,490
Was, like, something different or if you made different choices I really don't know

350
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:23,190
But for me it hit that too much and once I got to the point where it's like I get it you're in my house

351
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:27,720
you're gonna stab me in the eyes that's when it kind of lost it for me but then you know it was pretty cool

352
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,480
The bonus test I have no idea. What that was for I got too

353
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,870
many of those right but either way

354
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,380
Thank you everybody so much for watching!

355
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,560
If you want to take this test for yourself I'll provide a link in the description

356
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:40,500
but this one does cost money, I think it's like 5 bucks so thank you everybody so much! and as always

357
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:49,300
I will see you in the next video! BUH-BY

358
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:57,000
(Nawh, damn.. I forgot his outro music name, but I'm pretty sure it's by Teknoaxe)
