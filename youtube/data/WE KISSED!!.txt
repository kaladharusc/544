what is it is to roll

40
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:34,650
it's just like mixed record and ice cream and rolled into a role it's not

41
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:39,720
like instrumentation organized for roles of our ice cream roles like that's

42
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,100

different way reported him

47
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:04,080
they said they can't do anything because they're independent contractors and I'll

48
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,040

kidding me right now

50
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,200
wish I'd been in that car with you well so then I was like us on the door but i

51
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,580
did not instigate which normally I do and not that time I did not enjoy the

52
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:23,100
movie go see we're going to see the the one about the plane about captain silly

53
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:31,440
yeah place were directed take care sir that was like a real New York City Taxi

54
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,770
Driver he had the Brooklyn accent the whole thing

55
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:44,190
he started three minutes ago but at this theater you choose your seats ahead of

56
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:51,150
time so no pressure . previews and stuff seriously

57
00:04:54,100 --> 00:05:01,270
yeah

58
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:15,070
the prophecy restriction prophecy is smoothing later has declined see and

59
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:18,310
we're seeing the captain's solo movie expected this is the captain

60
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:22,490
brace for impact

61
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:31,360
say what you want about Clint Eastwood the guy knows how to tell a story and I

62
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,450
do think Tom Hanks is one of the greatest actors right he's unbelievable

63
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:37,360
what you disagree

64
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:43,600
he really is that good that's two thumbs you that your yeah that's two thumbs up

65
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:54,040
for pick up a pickup shot in movie making a pickup shot is when you need to

66
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,730
get another shot are you missed a shot see if you're back at a later date and

67
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:03,340
shoot a pickup shot that video that I shot yesterday with my friend Carly

68
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:08,050
we have to shoot a pickup shot tonight it's now seven o'clock and i'm leaving

69
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:11,050
the house to go like to go work

70
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,390
yeah

71
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:24,400
it's only at the end of this summer when you get these purple sunsets like this

72
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,680
also for what it's worth the 10 this this building right here is brand-new in

73
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,390
the penthouse the top floor cost 50 million dollars

74
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:37,849
Candace showed me on the Internet

75
00:06:37,849 --> 00:06:38,860
yeah

76
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,409
yeah

77
00:06:40,409 --> 00:06:44,849
youtube

78
00:06:44,849 --> 00:06:47,480
yeah it's a location

79
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,180
take care

80
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:54,949
i'm meeting up with the production team first I think I'm meeting them here and

81
00:06:54,949 --> 00:06:58,280
then when you shoot the scene it's a quick scene but it's like once you get

82
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:02,120
all the balls moving everybody in the right light ends up taking two hours and

83
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,740
I know it's going to take tonight

84
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:06,830
yeah yeah yeah yeah

85
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,380
yeah

86
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:24,740
no surprise at all it's very simple like five second shot is vastly more

87
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:30,110
complicated than we anticipated Brett is like building a light out of it

88
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:37,040
binder kind of a binder and a flashlight that work it works keep getting yelled

89
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:43,430
at by security gonna get the shot but it's like the most simple shot it's the

90
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:46,430
most complicated thing together

91
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:58,220
points bread so we gotta be johnny-on-the-spot quick with this

92
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:02,600
growing you take or two before they will tell us we can't shoot here

93
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:07,720
that looks great pull it back just a little bit further off the binder and if

94
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,100
you use it there you go just like that

95
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:13,450
yeah all right we got the shot at the hotel but only with security like

96
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:18,190
yelling is over and over and over again that permission to shoot there was

97
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:20,920
mostly on the sides you ever follow the rules

98
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,850
I just think permission comes you up so much what were you like in grade school

99
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:28,540
did you and troubles so now that you have models

100
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:33,370
ya know now but this is it i'm just driving with you right now for moral

101
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:34,060

106

saying whatever it's alright

107
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:07,460
remember I won't let you know I was like this is a five-second shoot it's gonna

108
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:11,390
take two hours it didn't take two hours it took three and a half but we got

109
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:15,860
everything we needed was a big success now it's late and I stopped your the
