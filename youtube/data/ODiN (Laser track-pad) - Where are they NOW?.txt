6
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,380
well any any time I see an opportunity

to fight I'm gonna take it don't believe

8
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,660
me ask the dishes right now it looks

9
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,460
like I got a big lumbering dumbass

10
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,739
behind me what do you say we show him

11
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:39,310

[Music]

13
00:00:47,680 --> 00:01:01,450
[Music]

14
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:03,890
hey everybody welcome back to another

15
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:06,230
episode of kick starter crap where are

16
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:07,240
they now

17
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,940
this episode is not necessarily kick

18
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,340
starter crap because at the time the

19
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,110
project I was looking at I called it

20
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:18,500
kick starter cool hey everybody and

21
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,479
welcome back not to another episode of

22
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,700
kick starter crap but to a new series

23
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,740
that's called kick starter cool

24
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:27,500
this project is called Odin the world's

25
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,560
first projection mouse it was kind of

26
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,619
cool it is it is a new idea but it's not

27
00:01:33,619 --> 00:01:36,350
a practical idea which is why I was

28
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:38,660
sarcastic the whole time and made

29
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,930
remarks like this have you ever used a

30
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:43,640
traditional Mouse with it with laser at

31
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,899
the bottom have you ever used that yeah

32
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:50,479
suck their funding goal was $50,000 and

33
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,369
they ended up doubling it and they

34
00:01:52,369 --> 00:01:54,700
mainly did this by selling the odin's at

35
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:58,399
$49 per unit but my main qualms if you

36
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,369
could call it that is that it just

37
00:02:01,369 --> 00:02:03,440
seemed to be an inferior trackpad so

38
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,910
yeah it mainly appeals to tech

39
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:06,710
enthusiasts who want to see the newest

40
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,989
piece of laser technology or people

41
00:02:08,989 --> 00:02:11,510
often making purchases from ThinkGeek it

42
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:13,640
looks like a transformer can you make a

43
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,470
bumblebee version can you make the

44
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:18,110
trackpad worse but make the bumblebee

45
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,840
factor better so my other gripe was the

46
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,760
pain thing the wrist pain

47
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,769
say goodbye to wrist pain let your wrist

48
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:27,350
hurt no more you still use your wrist a

49
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:27,799
little bit

50
00:02:27,799 --> 00:02:29,930
when you're on the trackpad I did get my

51
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:31,940
hands on the Odin but before we look at

52
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,260
it we're going to read some of the

53
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,610
comments and see what you guys thought

54
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:37,610
of it so kickstarter crap sarcastic

55
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:42,140
edition hmm but dupes i think he was

56
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:45,440
being sarcasm correct you're not very

57
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,140
good at sarcasm I've been told that more

58
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:50,209
than once the comment section is mostly

59
00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:52,280
about whether the video was sarcastic or

60
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,860
not so mission accomplished on that one

61
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,959
now we're gonna move on to the unboxing

62
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,590
of the laser trackpad unbox therapy suck

63
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:03,739
my shriveled up nuts like a lot of the

64
00:03:03,739 --> 00:03:05,269
other Kickstarter products that I've

65
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:07,400
looked at the packaging was better than

66
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,110
the product itself it comes with a

67
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,870
transformer head and a very ugly

68
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:14,000
microUSB cable but they were very

69
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,750
specific

70
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,270
in designing this micro USB cable

71
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:20,240
because it needs to be super soft and

72
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,860
flexible because if there's any

73
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,410
stiffness then it will actually just

74
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:26,330
push the Odin wallets on your desk

75
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:28,610
because it has to sit on an even surface

76
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:31,040
otherwise you get this weird warping

77
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,960
with the laser one thing that I

78
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,270
definitely admire is the touch to make

79
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:37,940
the eyeballs like blink when you're

80
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:41,720
clicking the left or right trackpad

81
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,730
buttons like it said in the video it's

82
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:46,490
good for designers video gamers and

83
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:49,370
office workers now I'm not an office

84
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:51,740
worker I'm not really a designer but I

85
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:54,950
game on occasion have you guys subside

86
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:57,640
of x' games we're gonna be playing pub G

87
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,709
battlegrounds edition and we're gonna do

88
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:03,620
it all with this laser trackpad should I

89
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,390
take the safe bet and maybe go to the

90
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:08,630
pool house or something nah roofs away

91
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:11,780
roofs the fucking one I don't want to

92
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,970
fucking move if I move I'm just gonna

93
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:16,430
die there's there's too much fucking

94
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:22,190
shmegmer on my trackpad oh shit fuck me

95
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:24,650

00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:31,490
because there's uh you know oh how did

97
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:36,440

101
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:00,169
Jesus Christ dude chill I'm using a

102
00:05:00,169 --> 00:05:02,720
trackpad oh shit the actually talk you

103
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,650
actually speak English

104
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:06,950
shit alright well in that case ya

105
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:14,990
respect me

106
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:21,440
ah fuck you you fucking bitch sorry I

107
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,480
dub how to do it to you man go suck your

108
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,430
mom's tit you gotta play this game like

109
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:27,920
a coward I wasn't done testing it there

110
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,570
I wanted to see how it worked on

111
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:31,820
different textures because they did a

112
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,980
kind of a poor job demonstrating it in

113
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,930
their video they said you can use it in

114
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:38,180
all these different environments kind of

115
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,490
so what I did is I laid out nine

116
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:43,670
different textures and I tested the

117
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:46,190
effectiveness of the laser on all those

118
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,530
different things and I would say for the

119
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:51,590
most part all of them performed quite

120
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:54,260
nicely the unfortunate part the laser

121
00:05:54,260 --> 00:06:00,590
didn't work in the milk it's not working

122
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:03,020
the fabric didn't work too well either

123
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,150
because it was very malleable and it

124
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:06,470
would just move around every time you

125
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:09,020
tried to fuck with it overall I can't

126
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,510
dog it too hard you know does its job it

127
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:14,570
doesn't do it well but it does job the

128
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:18,950
verdict is it a bi or is it a fry ship

129
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:23,120
it or lick it take it or stank it cash

130
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,860
it or trash it it's basically saying

131
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:28,340
it's always going to be garbage but if

132
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:31,130
you think someone else should have it or

133
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:33,080
should get value out of it then you can

134
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,420
cash it but if you trash it that just

135
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,220
goes into a landfill and no one gets it

136
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,880
okay I've convinced myself I'm going to

137
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:44,210
call this one a cash it this video is

138
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:45,050
now complete

139
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:47,000
thank you so much for your love and

140
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,120
support and if you like any more idubbbz

141
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,330
content i did i did genuinely upload to

142
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:56,240
the idubbbz games channel i'm gonna try

143
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,790
to upload there more that is not sarcasm

144
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,920
i know that it probably sounds like it

145
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,960
key word there being tried and it tried

146
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,180
to do it i'm occasionally posting on

147
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,820
items TV - so go over there that's why

148
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,680
there's not so many videos here all the

149
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:09,950
time

150
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,840
I'm trying to maintain the other

151
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,180
channels it's a work in progress but

152
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,860
eventually we're gonna have them all

153
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:19,010
going full-steam I will ascend us in the

154
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:20,420
next level once that have

155
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:22,130
you'll see me on Jimmy Fallon's

156
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:25,370
lettering together or to his truth I'm

157
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:27,040
FA that

158
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,550
decide to live with life

159
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:34,569
that's their concern not mine my

160
00:07:34,569 --> 00:07:37,390
they're free to find

161
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,760
[Music]

162
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,050
we caught on the condition of your

163
