think it doesn't work better for videos

107
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,650
does it look bad in videos when you have

108
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:26,469
a big glass of something and you got

109

113
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,680
look at those monitors in the background

114
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,900

115
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,120

121
00:06:58,029 --> 00:06:59,710
look at that there's a woman with a

122
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:03,729
pussy Turkey locator call this could

123
00:07:03,729 --> 00:07:06,219
actually be really good if we expand on

124
00:07:06,219 --> 00:07:08,349
the squirrel series and we we end up

125
00:07:08,349 --> 00:07:10,120
just doing more wildlife stuff in

126
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:14,259

131
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:28,320
that would make sense

132
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,820
sounds remarkably like a turkey

133
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:36,750
so the actual way you do it is like this

134
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,400
if I saw this somewhere I'd think it was

135
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,470
