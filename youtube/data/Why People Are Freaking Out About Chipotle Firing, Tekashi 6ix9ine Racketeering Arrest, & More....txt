1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:06,359
Beautiful bastards, hope even a fantastic Monday, welcome back to the philip defranco show and a quick note before we get started one

2
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:11,040
I hope you enjoy today's special guests bag number one bag. Number two. We were able to get them on our show

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:17,580
Thanks to our sponsors common cold and smoke alarm asking to be tested at 3:30 in the morning in my baby's room in two this

4
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:22,230
Week since we have Thanksgiving there will only be a new show to date tomorrow and Wednesday and that's right

5
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,949
Now there are no scheduled videos Thursday or Friday so that we can all spend time with family

6
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:29,220
But with that said for the Monday PBS, let's just jump into it

7
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,640
And the first thing we want to talk about today is Chipotle which I found out today

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:39,760
I have been pronouncing wrong since forever since 2015. There's been a lot of people that associate Chipotle with E. Coli and norovirus

9
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:45,210
There's a lot of anger and disgust around that but you know, I like all things time goes on people forget

10
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:49,890
It was a thing that just happened back in the day. But oh here we are again late 2018

11
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:55,410
So many people angry about Chipotle, although it doesn't have to do with norovirus or E. Coli over the weekend

12
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:00,809
There were a series of Twitter videos that just went massively viral after showing an incident that took place at a Chipotle in st

13
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:06,270
Paul Minnesota last week the person who recorded and post the video was 21 year old Masud Ali and he tweeted can a group of

14
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:16,869
Young well-established African American get a bite to eat after a long workout session at Chipotle tweets in the video. We see the manager say

15
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:21,390
You didn't see the manager seemingly ignoring the customers as they continue to accuse her of stereotyping them

16
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,520
They continue to ask for food and then we see the male employee say

17
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:28,040
Be like, we're not gonna make food unless she goes

18
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:38,390
Then seemingly get outraged they start shouting at a white customer asking why he didn't have to pay first

19
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:43,360
We then see another tweet from Ali saying note how this employee said we've seen you guys come in twice and later

20
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,369
Say he never saw us in his entire life calling

21
00:01:45,369 --> 00:01:48,880
The police on loyal customers is super disrespectful and uncalled for it's unacceptable

22
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,350
And I don't appreciate these employees making false accusations

23
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:57,979
But in the video what we see is the male employee saying to the guy holding the camera

24
00:01:57,979 --> 00:02:04,360
Then it appears another customer says that both of the employees are new and so in response to that separate person responds

25
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:08,289
I've never seen you guys and so it looks like Ali is trying to use that to say the employee contradicted himself

26
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:13,510
You didn't see a new customer arrive. There's a back and forth. There's followed by yet another tweet and video captioned

27
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,400
I don't like how she's laughing like something is funny

28
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,269
So when a white woman walks in you change your policy of show us income before you get served

29
00:02:19,269 --> 00:02:23,769
So action Poli gonna sit here and tell me I can't eat because they think I look like someone that's stole from them before in

30
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:28,910
Addition to the previous clip they show if they have money to pay Elite Sweeting notice how they complete ignored are proof of income

31
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:32,690
Actually tweets, I need answers. You don't see them wave their money around while the employee

32
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:37,209
Apologizes to the other customer even going further and apologizing that customer giving them that meal for free

33
00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:40,690
Which I Lee tweeted so we need to provide proof of income, but she gets her meal for free

34
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:45,310
This is beyond me adding. Nobody wants to say it. So I guess I will at Chipotle tweets basically implied

35
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:49,489
We can't afford a $7 meal. We then went on to tweets for the people who wanted the address and phone number

36
00:02:49,489 --> 00:02:50,290
Here you go

37
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:56,380
enjoy and including a screenshot where the address and phone number of that Chipotle is what followed all of this was Chipotle tweeting directly to

38
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:59,530
Utley saying what happened here is not how our employees should treat our customers

39
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:04,570
We are committed to treating all of our guests fairly and with respect the manager has been terminated and the restaurant has been retrained

40
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:10,150
So this doesn't happen again. We'll be back in touch later adding the manager thought these gentlemen were the same customers from Tuesday night

41
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:13,900
Who weren't able to pay for their meal regardless, this is not how we treat our customers as a result

42
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,739
the manager has been terminated but

43
00:03:15,739 --> 00:03:21,260
That is not the end of this story after all these videos and tweets went viral some Twitter users start sharing

44
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:25,060
Screenshots of old tweets where he was bragging about dining and dashing in the past

45
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:30,670
We it's like dine and dash is forever interested. Not not a dine and dash. We're just borrowing the food for a couple hours

46
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:33,010
That's all guys were borrowing food at si

47
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:33,880
They were like, hey, sir

48
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,019
You got to pay for that and I was like fork that there's a kid in need walked out in another reading a man

49
00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:40,790
I think Chappellet catching up to us fam. Should we change two occasions?

50
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:44,030
And yo, what should we do about the other thing reportedly by Sunday morning?

51
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,439
Those tweets were then to leave it

52
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:50,689
Also some users tagged in those posts of the activity of their accounts or switched them to private and according to the Miami Herald who?

53
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:54,890
Looked even further into the situation Ali is reportedly on probation for theft

54
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:56,120
now after this news spread

55
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:01,579
We saw several social media users come out in support of the manager domine a change.org petition was set up to help her get her

56
00:04:01,579 --> 00:04:05,659
Job back as well as a GoFundMe page and we saw a lot of support for this fired manage tweets

57
00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:10,790
Like I go to this Chipotle like four times a week and I've never seen this manager be anything but respectful and kind all customers

58
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:13,159
Please like this to Ali reading as an african-american male

59
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:18,079
I just want to say people like you are the reason we will always be looked down upon you have no shame for setting that

60
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,430
Poor lady up like that to lose her job

61
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:23,720
And so at this point Chipotle has been hit and was continuing to be a hit by both sides

62
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,360
You're the people that were taking the video at face value saying oh my god

63
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:30,650
I can't believe people like this work for Chipotle. This is disgusting and now on the other side you have people going

64
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:34,940
Wow, I just can't believe this company right? They saw the backlash online rather than looking into it

65
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:39,110
Maybe hopefully trusting their employees they just fire them and so then we saw Chapel

66
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:45,229
They release a new state writing our actions were based on the facts known to us immediately after the incident including video footage social media

67
00:04:45,229 --> 00:04:48,110
posts and conversations with the customer manager and our employees

68
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:52,370
We now have additional information which needs to be investigated further. We want to do the right thing

69
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:56,389
So after further investigation, we will retrain and rehire if the facts warrants

70
00:04:56,389 --> 00:05:00,470
But after this we saw author Matt Palumbo calling out Chipotle writing this is an absolute lie

71
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,039
I emailed your media relations

72
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:07,490
department and she claims you were aware of the tweets where the dude admitted to dine and dashing at the time of the fire and

73
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:11,930
Including a screenshot of the alleged emails right now. It's unclear if the manager would get her job back

74
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:15,440
But also if I was that manager, I don't know if I would want to work for that company

75
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,300
I feel like most people that work for a very large company

76
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,570
they already feel incredibly disposable and to me what it feels like with the

77
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:29,090
Situation as we witnessed a very large company going into self-preservation mode going one employee doesn't matter doesn't matter what the situation actually is

78
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:33,889
What matters is public perception and let's fix this and so rather than standing by their employee? And yes

79
00:05:33,889 --> 00:05:38,780
I will say arguably doing the much harder thing educating people to the reality of the situation

80
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:44,360
Even after outrage has taken hold they just fired and then they go full parental mode, but I'm not surprised here

81
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,880
I'm just disappointed in Chipotle and also with this story

82
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,180
It's incredibly frustrating for the same reason as all of the fake stories

83
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,249
You know that racial profiling is a thing

84
00:05:52,249 --> 00:05:57,919
think back to April when you had those two black customers in Philadelphia who arrested for being in a Starbucks and then separately we see

85
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:03,119
people like this guy who are seemingly misrepresenting the situation people that have a history a

86
00:06:03,119 --> 00:06:08,509
Self-admitted history of dining and - that's allowing people to call into question people actually experience

87
00:06:08,509 --> 00:06:10,369
This is all just incredibly frustrating

88
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:14,629
But with all of that said that it's the story of my personal takeaway, and I passed the question off to you

89
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:19,489
What are your thoughts around this around the manager Olli Chipotle's decisions here any and all thoughts?

90
00:06:19,489 --> 00:06:21,679
I'd love to see but from that I want to share some stuff

91
00:06:21,679 --> 00:06:29,159
I love today and today and also brought to you by privacy calm Phil privacy calm is all about security and keeping those unwanted

92
00:06:29,159 --> 00:06:34,519
Fraudulent charges away from you and they do that by creating secure virtual cards for you cards that are locked to a merchant

93
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,860
So even if let's say a site they used got hacked

94
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:39,559
If someone has that information, they can't use that card elsewhere

95
00:06:39,559 --> 00:06:43,549
Not only is privacy calm 100 percent free to use but if you go to privacy calm

96
00:06:43,549 --> 00:06:47,989
Phil you get set up you get started they will give you five dollars that you had to spend on whatever you've got Black Friday

97
00:06:47,989 --> 00:06:53,809
And Cyber Monday coming up an extra five dollars always helpful actually on that note for any subscription or purchase privacy

98
00:06:53,809 --> 00:06:59,059
Calm is a Chrome browser extension. It allows you to generate new virtual debit card numbers on the fly from any checkout page

99
00:06:59,059 --> 00:07:01,099
So you don't have to flip back and forth while you're shopping

100
00:07:01,099 --> 00:07:06,079
So make sure to head on over to privacy comm slash Phil and start protecting your information today and the first bit of awesome today

101
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:12,769
Was we had SRAM Miller and Eddie Redmayne competing in a complement battle. Then we had a fantastic video game donkey taking on Pokemon

102
00:07:12,769 --> 00:07:17,839
Let's go Pikachu and Evie and sarah silverman and john, c reilly answering the web's most searched questions

103
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:21,619
We got the final trailer for Aquaman. Got an awesome video from NASA called

104
00:07:21,619 --> 00:07:27,799
We are NASA then if you've been wanting to watch some old movies YouTube has you covered they recently just released a bunch of videos

105
00:07:27,799 --> 00:07:30,019
That you can watch for free they have ads with them

106
00:07:30,019 --> 00:07:33,169
And as far as the selection of movies same things like the first five Rocky movies

107
00:07:33,169 --> 00:07:38,959
Although I think you can just watch the first four and you're good movies like Legally Blonde Legally Blonde - movie. I love that

108
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:42,079
I'm scared to go back and see if it holds up like hackers among other movies

109
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:45,809
it's got the official trailer for once upon a Deadpool which has such a

110
00:07:45,809 --> 00:07:49,110
fantastically weird concept that I just I can't wait to watch it is the

111
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:49,709
Pg-13 version

112
00:07:49,709 --> 00:07:54,679
Of Deadpool - and I don't I don't want to it you can just even watch and if you want to see the full versions

113
00:07:54,679 --> 00:07:57,169
Of everything. I just shared the secret link of the day really anything

114
00:07:57,169 --> 00:08:02,489
I talked about today links as always are in the description down below and then let's talk about why we had Daniel and Hernandez aka

115
00:08:02,489 --> 00:08:07,220
Takashi 6:9 back and the reason he's back in the news is he is facing some legal

116
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:11,590
Troubles and understand what happened today. We need to look back to 2015 and that's because back in 2015

117
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:16,970
He pled guilty to one count of use of a child in a sexual performance and reportedly in legal documents that were obtained

118
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:22,330
prosecutor said Takashi was at a party in Harlem where a 13 year old girl was taped engaging in sexual acts with another man while

119
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:27,770
Takashi 18 at the time stood behind the child making a thrusting motion with his pelvis and smacking on her buttock

120
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:29,830
Prosecutors adding with child was nude in the video

121
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:34,419
So he pled guilty and his sentence was deferred for two years with a judge adding that if 6-9 stayed out of trouble

122
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:37,839
He'd just get probation which then takes us to the news that we saw last month

123
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,550
Prosecutors reportedly said that he should get one two

124
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:45,740
Three years prison time Takashi's team saying that he should get four years probation the judge agreed giving him four years probation

125
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:50,140
Also giving him credit for one year. So this was massively good news for me avoided jail time

126
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:55,360
It just had to not get in trouble really fast forward to what we've seen for the past week last Wednesday

127
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,020
He pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct in connection to an assault of an officer and with his guilty plea

128
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:03,880
Prosecutors threw out the misdemeanor charge and gave him plenty of probation also over the past week

129
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:10,240
We saw Takashi 6:9 fire his team saying last Thursday on Instagram. He no longer had a manager booking agent or publicist

130
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,570
I'll fight everybody in my team. I got a manager. I got a booking agent

131
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:18,130
No PR or public I got nobody on my team adding that his American tour was cancelled

132
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:19,850
He also warned venues to be aware of any

133
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,779
Agents booking him unless he said so himself if you me shows

134
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:26,870
I would let people know down booking shows or if you're not on the phone with me

135
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,990
Do not book that show cuz it's not me

136
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:34,600
I fight everybody on the fork who used to see me with they no longer around then I got the news sunday

137
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:40,029
That's Akashi six nine his now former manager and two former associates were all arrested reportedly

138
00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:45,100
They are all facing firearm and racketeering charges. So as I'm recording this video, that's where we are right now

139
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:50,930
We're waiting for more information to come out and I'm really interested to see what information does come out because the whole situation

140
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:55,660
Around him seems insane. I mean even talking about his past charges these new charges

141
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:56,510
It doesn't even really

142
00:09:56,510 --> 00:10:00,860
encompass the whole situation if things like on November 8th where a gunman reportedly fired multiple

143
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:04,810
Times at a house where Kanye West and 69 were having a shoot

144
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:08,660
it was at the situation back in July where 69 said he was kidnapped and robbed and so I'm just really

145
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:12,220
Fascinated to see what comes out and what happens next but also with this story

146
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,740
I do want to ask you a question around six nine. He's looking out there

147
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:21,100
He is either incredibly loved or incredibly hated a lot of that hate obviously stemming from the incident with the thirteen-year-old girl

148
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:24,320
This is for people on both sides of this that really loved in your thoughts and your feelings

149
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:24,910
Around it

150
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:30,850
and then let's talk about the updates around these California fires regarding the Woolsey fire which we saw burn through Thousand Oaks in Malibu that

151
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:37,490
Is at 94 percent containment reportedly the 96 thousand acre fire destroy at least 1500 structures damaged another

152
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:41,810
341 also from this fire three people reportedly died and three firefighters were injured

153
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:45,709
And as far as the other major fire, that is the campfire, which is the now

154
00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:50,140
151 thousand acre fire as a recording this video and is now 66 percent contained

155
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:55,270
It has destroyed eleven thousand seven hundred thirteen single residences and the truly horrific news around this

156
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:59,680
Is that seventy seven people have died with a list of missing people sitting at nine hundred ninety one

157
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,630
but also on that note reportedly the list might not be accurate as one might hope it would be importantly this number is coming from

158
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:08,500
Raw data that's being collected from phone calls emails the 9-1-1 system

159
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,029
It's been described is not perfect data

160
00:11:10,029 --> 00:11:14,589
And the thinking is that it's just better to get information out there to help start getting people accounted for and so on that note

161
00:11:14,589 --> 00:11:19,029
They're urging people to check the list and if they see the name of a loved one, and they know that that person's safe

162
00:11:19,029 --> 00:11:21,640
They should contact the sheriff's office. Also regarding the search right now

163
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,760
there were reportedly more than

164
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:28,270
500 specialists searching for remains which could get even more complicated in the coming days as forecasts are predicting heavy rains

165
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,380
Although of course on the positive note this could help

166
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:36,079
Firefighters battle the rest of the blaze also in addition to those who died those who are missing there are tons of people displaced

167
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:37,750
reportedly with so many people forced to evacuate

168
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:41,920
It's been filling up shelters in the area and even a tent city was set up next to a Walmart though

169
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,610
I should note there

170
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:47,829
That officials have said they're working on moving evacuees in the tent city to a shelter and according to Red Cross spokesman, Tony Briggs

171
00:11:47,829 --> 00:11:52,180
they don't have an estimate right now for how long the shelters will be around or how much this is all going to cost but

172
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:55,600
Adding I think it's safe to say we're going to be here for a while. Also on Saturday

173
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:01,570
we saw president drum touring the Northern California town of Paradise that was ravaged by the camp fire with Governor Jerry Brown and the new

174
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:05,959
Governor elect Gavin Newsom and that made news for several reasons one just the pure

175
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:09,820
Devastation that can be seen in the background is the most notable thing

176
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:15,620
Then - we had Trump make news because he called the town the wrong name twice we saw

177
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,450
At pleasure

178
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:23,140
What an end right now, but what we just saw we just left pleasure

179
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:28,980
Palace 3 Donald Trump was asked if seeing this changed his mind on climate change and we saw this no

180
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:36,580
No, I have a strong opinion on what great climate we're going to have that and we're gonna have forests that are very safe

181
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:39,690
I'm just too tired for this and for we got Finland in the news

182
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:41,370
Thanks to President Trump because while he was there

183
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:46,980
he spoke about forest floors and how it's important to keep them clean saying it was with the president of Finland that he said we

184
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,220
have

185
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:50,100
Much different. We're a forest nation

186
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,890
He called it a forest nation and they spent a lot of time on

187
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:58,830
Drinking and cleaning and doing things and they don't have any problem and what it is

188
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:03,779
it's a very small problem and that of course isn't the first time it's just the latest time that he blamed forest management for the

189
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:04,210
current situation

190
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:09,279
However on this most recent know the president of Finland reportedly told sources that he does not remember discussing

191
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:13,920
Raking with Trump wordly saying quote I mentioned to him that Finland is a land covered by forests

192
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,290
And we also have a good monitoring system and network adding

193
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:21,000
We take care of our forests and according to Romney Ruska forest fires expert at the Finnish Interior Ministry

194
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,080
They do not rake the forests instead what they do as they focus on removing dead trees from the forest floor

195
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,910
You've also seen people pointing out the differences between the two countries

196
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:33,690
Finland has 57 million acres of forest and the timber and paper companies that work in the forest built an extensive network of roads that

197
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:36,700
Slowed down any fires and also allows easier access for fire crews

198
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,940
England is also much colder than California

199
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:43,710
Which means the incendiary risk is much lower England also has different trees than those in California and Finland

200
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:46,560
The forests are mainly tall boreal trees pine spruce and Bert

201
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:52,660
Meanwhile in California much of the vegetation is lower lined shrubland and small trees and according professor Henrik Lindbergh a forest fires

202
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:55,750
researcher a better comparison to California would be the fire management in the

203
00:13:55,750 --> 00:14:00,010
Mediterranean where the forests are more similar on the positive end of this president Trump's comments about

204
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:05,700
Raking gave us tons of memes from Finland sweets like greetings from Finland. Just finished raking leaves here

205
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,500
Hashtag rake America green again

206
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:13,740
also getting pictures like this one of just an ordinary day in the Finnish forests and they were rake photo shops for days on the

207
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:18,480
Other side of this there have been some saying well, maybe what he's talking about is an excavator rate, but on that note

208
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,589
I'm not completely sure because when he was doing an interview with Chris Wallace, he kind of motioned a raking motion

209
00:14:23,589 --> 00:14:27,459
I was watching the fireman the other day and they were raking

210
00:14:27,459 --> 00:14:29,790
Areas, they were raking areas

211
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:35,220
Where the fire was right over there and they're raking trees to little trees like this that are a nut trees little bushes

212
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:38,070
That you could see a totally dry

213
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:42,260
Weeds and they're raking them. They're on fire and with closing out of this story

214
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,970
I do want to hit on town - final note the first being that the fires in

215
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:48,060
California have been truly truly horrible if you do want to help those affected

216
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:53,390
I'm going to include links down below where you can in - when it comes to this president and climate change and these fires

217
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:59,660
I'm just I'm just exhausted and part of that is possibly me being sick and tired today, but it's really exhausting

218
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,460
He gives simplified solutions false

219
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:08,540
Comparisons. It's important. Remember just 9 days ago when he said that this was all because of gross mismanagement of the forests that the

220
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:12,680
California Professional Firefighters had to come out and say that his assertion was dangerously wrong

221
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,410
Also, it's important remember in that same tweet where he made that assertion

222
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:20,430
He threatened to cut federal payments a move that among others was denounced by the International Association of firefighters

223
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:24,390
So just a little bit ago that regarding climate change I think was on Axios on HBO

224
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:30,410
He just disagreed with his agencies talking about climate change in the face of his own agencies giving him information

225
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:36,240
He creates this false equivalency with a minor voice when it comes to climate change it like NASA you look at

226
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:42,420
The Energy Department and what would your own government? Your own scientists have said about it. They said it's indisputable that

227
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:47,250
Humans have contributed to global warming in in big ways. Well, I do we

228
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,500
Certainly contribute. I mean there's

229
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,630
Certain pollutants that go up and there are certain things that happen certain things

230
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:57,110
We do that if we weren't here sir, they say the overwhelming cause for the loss

231
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:58,640
Well, I don't necessarily agree

232
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:03,140
But it doesn't seem like in the report that there's that much of a may to it. Like it's your government, right?

233
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:09,290
It's your scientists. They work for you would serve that's okay. It's okay, and I want everybody to write report whatever they want

234
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:12,090
But ultimately, I'm the one that makes that final decision

235
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:15,830
I can also give you reports where people for a much dispute that you know

236
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:22,190
You do have scientists that very much disputed. I want to make sure that we have the cleanest air art

237
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:25,550
I know that when there really aren't that many campus. I want to make sure here's what I want

238
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:28,650
I think it just needs to be an understood that that is where he stands on climate change

239
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:31,700
There's not gonna be I don't foresee that changing but guys I sir

240
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,540
I'm gonna end today's show

241
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:35,570
If you have any thoughts on the final story the first one anything in between, of course

242
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:36,840
