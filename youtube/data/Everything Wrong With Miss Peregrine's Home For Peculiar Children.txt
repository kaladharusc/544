1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:11,010
49 seconds of three logos I am so

2
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,380
fucking sick of fucking logos man this

3
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,340
used to mean something

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,260
goddamn Sam take a movie off you don't

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,640
have to appear in everything News

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,050
article tells us that people have long

7
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,730
known about peculiars but this is

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:21,960
definitely not the case during the rest

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,160
of the movie so unless this is a

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,570
clipping from The Daily Prophet it's

11
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,090
some bull did they just peculiar eyes

12
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,250
Santa Claus I know he's a real person

13
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,410
but doesn't sound like ransom riggs it's

14
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:32,640
the name of a character Mel Gibson would

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,140
put in his next movie do you ever feel

16
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,510
like nothing you do matters all the time

17
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,250
given Hollywood's remakes equal machine

18
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,530
thanks for asking also peculiar Asian

19
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:41,940
it's not safe

20
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,670
stay away well it's also not safe to

21
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,320
have an extremely visible annotated map

22
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,969
of all the secret loop entrances but I

23
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:52,789
guess we'll get to that later

24
00:00:52,789 --> 00:00:55,020
Shelley is largely unconcerned with a

25
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,309
sudden apparition that appeared in the

26
00:00:56,309 --> 00:00:59,820
middle of the goddamn road grandpa oh no

27
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,649
grandpa's been ransacked and suddenly

28
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:03,000
this movie is way more national treasure

29
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,710
than it wants to be someone broke in

30
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:07,470
I've got a 38 in my car you wait there

31
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,030
even in the age of cellphones movie

32
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:10,080
characters will go to great lengths to

33
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,460
not immediately call the police at a

34
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,720
crime scene

35
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,180
trevor how many times have i told you

36
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,620
kid sees a bloody flashlight and grabs

37
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,660
it blood fence that only Godzilla could

38
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,100
have wrecked this badly let's examine

39
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:23,820
this further

40
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,500
grandpa has either a bloody carving fork

41
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,000
or a bloody tuning fork in his hand and

42
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,260
the fact that I don't care says a lot

43
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,030
about this mystery and I'm gonna have to

44
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,490
get away from here how is he still alive

45
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:33,990
enough to give the cryptic instructions

46
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:35,370
everyone else that this happens too in

47
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:36,540
this movie is dedicated

48
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,710
but the bird will explain everything oh

49
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:42,690
okay gotcha that's actually what I

50
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:44,430
expected you to say I was expecting that

51
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,950
I thought I could protect Asa

52
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,420
Butterfield isn't acting here he's

53
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,130
genuinely concerned his co-star has had

54
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,450
a stroke it's the super authentic

55
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,100
concerned what's going on right now face

56
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:59,850
I should have told you years ago father

57
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:00,960
figure of character with all the

58
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,190
important information dies before

59
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,869
getting it all out cliche also this

60
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:05,400
movie is giving me way more John Carter

61
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,930
flashbacks than I think a tribute maybe

62
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,490
I just have John Carter PTSD or

63
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:10,200
something considering this was only a

64
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,750
month ago I think you're doing

65
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,310
exceptionally well holy Sh they got him

66
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,750
right into counseling after the death of

67
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,980
a loved one even if the doctor is

68
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,209
actually an evil Hollow in disguise

69
00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:19,860
that's actually pretty fantastic so I'll

70
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,410
remove one sin date dna-tested the floor

71
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:26,519
Janet had animal DNA so that's case

72
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:28,860
closed he sounds like an extraordinary

73
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,140
gentleman maybe he was but why the what

74
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,580
Samuel oh Jenny say this after the

75
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,290
coroner DNA comment which had nothing to

76
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:35,580
do with this character and everything to

77
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:36,209
do with his murder

78
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:38,400
we're very close footage indicates that

79
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,410
yes they were close as grandpa regaled

80
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,209
grandson with tales of treasure and wait

81
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:43,500
a minute I'm getting national treasure

82
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,239
vibes here again that's where I hate

83
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:46,410
from the monsters

84
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,120
telling a kid this age stories like this

85
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,640
regardless of truth this is stuff kids

86
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,200
this age need stories about fairies and

87
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,150
talking animals and Jesus not monsters

88
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:57,510
in another dimension everything's

89
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,480
already been discovery buddy you dad the

90
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,630
headmistress miss Peregrine's it was a

91
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:06,570
home for special children that's special

92
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:07,739
children and not gifted youngsters

93
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:09,060
because we don't wanna get our Fox

94
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,769
properties confused this is the exact

95
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:12,150
opposite of an orgy of evidence that

96
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,620
this is a boy's room we have a couple of

97
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,180
dinosaur figures near the lamp base a

98
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,400
few personal drawings a random panda and

99
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,110
a detailed world map this kid either

100
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,580
hates sports or was literally Niles

101
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,890
crane or both this is the cleanest

102
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:24,330
fucking elementary school classroom I've

103
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:25,740
ever seen they're telling me not one of

104
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,180
these kids has moved their composition

105
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:27,990
books from the upper left

106
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,280
corner of their desk even accidentally

107
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,590
it's fun

108
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:33,000
and given it's your birthday I'm

109
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,380
guessing grandpa's gift is about to kick

110
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,210
start the plot at least dive I hope it

111
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:39,080
does there's just one hotel

112
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,890
how do you they're rolling number a

113
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:42,420
cliched ahead have a drink why don't you

114
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,950
I like how this movie's hero basically

115
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:45,510
takes a tug boat to the island place of

116
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:46,980
script conflict here's a place of

117
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,600
business named the priests whole world

118
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,100
war whatever wall pictures paint a

119
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,390
picture of the what the fucking hell is

120
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:55,290
that horrifying laps care I was just

121
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:56,610
wondering if any of you guys might be

122
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:58,530
interested and taken my son here to the

123
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,150
other side of the island I get he's got

124
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,560
his shoes but what kind of father

125
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,210
travels to an island with his son then

126
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:04,410
dumps him off on the first group of

127
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,090
Street locals he comes across well the

128
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:07,830
sickest office in Wales what happens

129
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,480
when UK teens watch eight-mile for the

130
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,510
first time

131
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:17,280
I think I'll kind of bog base for

132
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,470
eternity prank is this hahaha you're new

133
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:20,850
and you don't know this territory so

134
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:22,410
we'll make a step in a sinkhole of oil

135
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:24,840
hahaha god we're hilarious right okay

136
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,980
this part of the story takes place in

137
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,050
the present day so why the didn't Jake

138
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,640
Google Maps this place or at least call

139
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,080
someone in the area before making the

140
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,940
goddamn trip from Florida to Wales even

141
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,200
if this islands primitive they've got

142
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,180
ping phones you need to talk about all

143
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,100
this with someone funny like you we

144
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:41,280
should call dr. Colin oh so not you this

145
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,840
clock reminds me that it's almost 25

146
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,340
minutes into this movie about peculiar

147
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,540
children and all I can think about is

148
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,730
how boring it is a giant motherfucking

149
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:48,990
bomb fell through the roof of this room

150
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,340
but the glassware is still intact

151
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,320
must have been very selective about its

152
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,560
destructive abilities hilariously this

153
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,670
stumble apparently knocks him out cold

154
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:58,560
and roger goodell immediately issued a

155
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,880
statement denying football had anything

156
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,470
to do with it look if I woke up in the

157
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,210
arms of a female toddler carrying me I'd

158
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:05,430
flip the fuck out so kudos to this kid

159
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,860
for keeping his call also these two face

160
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,960
covered goddamn you'd be creepy enough

161
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,760
without that drawn on eyebrows goddamn

162
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,710
you creepy creepos Millard's supposed to

163
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:14,250
be invisible

164
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,050
not ethereal so why doesn't this mist

165
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:20,360
reveal the shape of his face

166
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,320
activating the portal sounds like the

167
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,820
first track on a spooky sounds for

168
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,680
Halloween CD like many before him Jake

169
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,360
runs away from scary adventure back to

170
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,560
the creepy loving arms of the priest

171
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,970
toll each American movie has time for

172
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:34,440
this of course it's a two-hour long

173
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,730
movie so it has time for virtually

174
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:37,440
anything Jesus he's invisible not

175
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,970
Quicksilver how's Millard getting to all

176
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:42,660
this dinner we're so quickly did olive

177
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,250
literally just torched the pub there's

178
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,110
still like 40 people in there holy these

179
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:47,760
peculiar children are secretly nihilists

180
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:52,260
it is 1943 September the 3rd 1943 all

181
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:55,080
day every day it's all loop so this is a

182
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,730
magic infused World War 2 Groundhog Day

183
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:58,950
cuz that's an awesome idea but you still

184
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,990
made this movie somehow right Tom tie

185
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:03,030
between the stylized hair the pale

186
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,680
complexion and the exaggerated accent in

187
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,330
a Tim Burton movie it's clear Ava green

188
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:07,980
has become the female Johnny Depp miss

189
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,450
peregrine's home for second hand smoke

190
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:11,400
inhalation know a few things I can't

191
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,380
explain for example what happened to Tim

192
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,150
Burton's career after Ed Wood some

193
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:17,820
people at peculiar it's a recessive gene

194
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,400
carried down through families since that

195
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,540
territory's never been covered before

196
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,270
I'm the type of peculiar called an in

197
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:26,130
brain an in brains main skill is the

198
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:28,020
manipulation of time we choose a safe

199
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,870
place a safe day and create agent this

200
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,520
is the exact day their house is bombed

201
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,140
though I know she can stop it before it

202
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,550
happens but there must be thousands of

203
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:37,260
other days that are safer right it is

204
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,580
pretty nice that they can get by with

205
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,020
just one giant carrot instead of a bunch

206
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,100
of smaller ones but peeling that

207
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,720
motherfucker is gonna be a bitch this

208
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,950
movie's home for peculiar children

209
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,480
prominently features an apple tree

210
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,040
immediately making me suspect to the

211
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,790
entire enterprise

212
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:52,740
damn he was an asshole he unleashes the

213
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,540
same bee power for a pickup soccer game

214
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,890
that he later uses in a life-or-death

215
00:06:55,890 --> 00:07:01,260
situation we'll discuss this later it

216
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,600
wasn't their fault this movie's laziness

217
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,130
Emma literally told miss Peregrine's

218
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:06,450
what happened at the pub as soon as they

219
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:08,010
return then miss Peregrine's told Jake

220
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,660
she expected some kerfuffle before they

221
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,220
headed back but now suddenly Emma's in

222
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,020
trouble jake takes the blame so we have

223
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,550
some manufactured warmth between the two

224
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:15,870
of them would you mind sign that rope

225
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:18,030
around my waist I'm sorry all I heard

226
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:19,770
was my waist you want me to do what now

227
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:21,210
also less do you think I'm being pervy

228
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,560
for bringing this up just look at how

229
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,710
this movie chose to shoot this scene

230
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:28,909
also the only way Jake would need to get

231
00:07:28,909 --> 00:07:30,530
this close to Emma to tie this rope as

232
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:31,580
if he were training to be the next

233
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:35,289
Christian Grey mister hold on tight I

234
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:37,219
know they're all getting along well but

235
00:07:37,219 --> 00:07:38,840
Emma is putting a massive amount of

236
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,789
trust into it dude she just met one slip

237
00:07:40,789 --> 00:07:42,289
of the rope and she's fucked what reason

238
00:07:42,289 --> 00:07:43,729
would Emma have to put the squirrel back

239
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:44,930
in the tree except to show off her

240
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,849
powers it's a fuckin squirrel it wants

241
00:07:46,849 --> 00:07:48,139
to climb back up in the tree that's what

242
00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:49,939
they do also he's totally looking up

243
00:07:49,939 --> 00:07:51,050
address right now as a matter of

244
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,789
function even if he's not turned on he

245
00:07:52,789 --> 00:07:54,110
basically has to look up her dress to

246
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:56,840
bring her down safely was he like you he

247
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,610
was like you Jake will continue to

248
00:07:58,610 --> 00:07:59,900
assume Jake has abilities without

249
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,400
specifically acknowledging the abilities

250
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,050
it wouldn't be a Tim Burton movie if we

251
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,340
didn't have a nightmarish steampunk

252
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,020
lobster baby doll do you want to see the

253
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:10,460
fun part the first rule about dom-based

254
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,409
Fight Club is you don't talk about doll

255
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:14,270
based Fight Club one doll has a lobster

256
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,860
hand but the other has a full-on goddamn

257
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,849
kitchen knife this is an unfair fight

258
00:08:18,849 --> 00:08:21,050
how does this not happen at every meal

259
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:22,789
then god damn it this movie just yearns

260
00:08:22,789 --> 00:08:28,509
to bust it's not on FX whenever it can

261
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:31,400
look cool you know this is downright

262
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,990
unnatural and wrong and this girl should

263
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:36,529
be a foster home for demons you should

264
00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:38,029
all get ready for movie time when I own

265
00:08:38,029 --> 00:08:39,979
suppose dinner's lasted less than 350

266
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:41,510
minutes but forget let's move on to the

267
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,550
next scene Dame Judi Dench is all mi had

268
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:45,560
a dream and thus the film budget was

269
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,029
increased by however much Judi Dench

270
00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:48,860
demanded which wasn't a lot and then

271
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,820
just continued as normal

272
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,830
this reinforces the point that this was

273
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:55,390
a stupid day to pick for the immigrant

274
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:57,070
I'm gobbledygook and was selected only

275
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:03,940
to synthesize some tension why would the

276
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,410
record play forward when time is still

277
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:06,730
going backward if you're gonna do

278
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:08,200
something like this movie can't do it

279
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,900
right what was that it was my phone

280
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,490
movie is almost an hour in and the only

281
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:13,810
conflict we've had it was way back when

282
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:15,580
the limey got his eyes ripped out it's

283
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,750
amazing that a story about kids with

284
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,910
magical abilities is so goddamn dull you

285
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:20,620
might even show them this photograph and

286
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,000
I'll still be here I should have called

287
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,500
this movie miss Spiderwick school for

288
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,140
unfortunate wimpy Potter's where are you

289
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,970
going downstairs for a drink and I will

290
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:31,090
need my heavy parka for that no wait

291
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:32,530
they've had time to get all the way from

292
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,210
the school to the hotel be accosted by

293
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,560
the farmer get settled into the room

294
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,210
make a phone call to the therapist and

295
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,830
have an argument if everything ages

296
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:40,210
after a few minutes when it's out of the

297
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:41,890
loop like Emma said earlier this flower

298
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:43,390
should be literally fucking dust right

299
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:46,660
now if I recall Miss Avocet has a loop

300
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:49,150
there please warn her and suggest that

301
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,430
she make a new one right away once again

302
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:52,570
if they can build new loops whenever

303
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:53,740
they want why wouldn't they do it more

304
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,930
often for a safety and variety I hate

305
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:57,940
these loops ha ha these white I have

306
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,260
motherfuckers are right in the middle of

307
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,000
a crowd and they have their picture

308
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,130
taken but no one notices it all mom

309
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:05,050
listen meet a fellow Birds Botha look I

310
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:06,370
like birds as much as the next guy

311
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:08,500
probably more this movie is supposed to

312
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,540
be about peculiar children I can't

313
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:11,770
believe I'm actually looking forward to

314
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:12,910
seeing this dude eventually become

315
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,560
samuel l.jackson generic movie villain

316
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,460
what's the point

317
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,050
dad perfectly sums up the first half of

318
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,990
this movie she knot it in brains always

319
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:22,120
female then how do they procreate I

320
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,430
found him in the woods with his eyes

321
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:25,990
missing and I'm just telling you this

322
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,370
right now even though it's really the

323
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:28,300
first thing I should have said upon

324
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,950
meeting you I asked you not to ask

325
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:30,580
questions

326
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,080
god damn someone tell him what the fuck

327
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,910
is going on we're over an hour into the

328
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:35,680
fucking movie this boating excursion

329
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,030
brings up yet another question about how

330
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,830
far they can go from the home presumably

331
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:40,270
miss Peregrine's clock applies to the

332
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,800
kids themselves not the island so

333
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,150
couldn't they just wander off anywhere

334
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,470
then come back before the clock resets

335
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:46,840
my point is these kids are immortal but

336
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,410
they do the same damn thing every day

337
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:53,699
oh yeah I also have this awesome ability

338
00:10:53,699 --> 00:10:54,839
that has nothing to do with my floaty

339
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:56,129
thing but I won't tell you about it

340
00:10:56,129 --> 00:10:57,269
until you've risked your life trying to

341
00:10:57,269 --> 00:10:57,690
save me

342
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,220
and the shoes are barely heavy enough to

343
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,720
offset her Flo tattooed on land so

344
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,069
should not be able to weight her down

345
00:11:02,069 --> 00:11:03,899
this much in deep water apparently these

346
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:05,370
people just sat here patiently at their

347
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:06,689
dinner table while they waited to die as

348
00:11:06,689 --> 00:11:08,670
the ship sank even though it reportedly

349
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,920
took 18 hours to sink of course this

350
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,240
girl is wearing all white after the

351
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,649
water logging because what good is a

352
00:11:13,649 --> 00:11:15,000
middling movie about magic aimed at

353
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,350
preteens without a little wet t-shirt

354
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:20,790
action movie briefly speaks to the

355
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,079
audience that's collectively fighting

356
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:22,589
off a coma

357
00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:26,610
I'm just Mane King character and a movie

358
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:28,410
about special people says this bull less

359
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:31,050
than half the movie left to go Jake only

360
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:33,629
a peculiar an entertainment movie

361
00:11:33,629 --> 00:11:35,550
jargons you into submission miss

362
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:37,050
Peregrine's kills this hollow everyday

363
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:39,449
in 1943 the loop continues but so does

364
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,339
regular time and the hollow definitely

365
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:43,470
dies on this debt so you mean in the

366
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,540
next 73 years neither Baron or the other

367
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,129
evil peculiars have realized this

368
00:11:47,129 --> 00:11:48,449
asshole was missing and came to

369
00:11:48,449 --> 00:11:50,250
investigate the coals amon aghast

370
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,290
because we're terrible at coming up with

371
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:54,000
names for things I will explain

372
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,680
everything Jake it'll occur around

373
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,000
halfway through the movies fourth hour

374
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,399
he kidnapped Anna Marie not knowing

375
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:00,810
caring whether she would survive the

376
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:03,000
experiment scientist Baron forgets how

377
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,439
to science in this experiment and

378
00:12:04,439 --> 00:12:06,000
subjects all these assholes to the

379
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,500
imporant transfer instead of just one at

380
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,149
a time Jesus Christ I've seen better

381
00:12:09,149 --> 00:12:10,709
effects in Raiders of the Lost Ark and

382
00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:12,899
that was in 1981 the rest of the

383
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,759
Moustakas Hallows he needs no more eyes

384
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:17,160
himself okay there were only 11 people

385
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,389
that were turned into hollows and at

386
00:12:18,389 --> 00:12:19,620
least five of them are pretty much human

387
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,240
now one is dead because miss Peregrine's

388
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,069
keeps killing it in 1943 so there are

389
00:12:23,069 --> 00:12:24,269
only five left that need to be converted

390
00:12:24,269 --> 00:12:26,009
this brings up the question shouldn't

391
00:12:26,009 --> 00:12:27,509
they have more carefully dispensed that

392
00:12:27,509 --> 00:12:29,459
eyeball orgy they had or shouldn't they

393
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:30,870
found enough in the ensuing years to

394
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:37,350
help out the few that we're left miss

395
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:38,939
Avocet punches another hole in the

396
00:12:38,939 --> 00:12:40,649
hollow lure if her kids were consumed

397
00:12:40,649 --> 00:12:42,300
then there should be plenty of eyeballs

398
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,410
to convert the rest of them back to

399
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:45,300
human form this deed was blindness so

400
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,559
whichever hollow got to him got some

401
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:48,689
bulk Bibles movie takes Goonies ending

402
00:12:48,689 --> 00:12:49,980
and anza what if there was still to

403
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,420
figure out ending onto it leading to

404
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:54,610
this father-son beach chase dr. Dalton

405
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:57,550
times when it suits me and I guess we'll

406
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,170
add shape-shifting powers to Berens bag

407
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:00,370
of tricks which no one else can do

408
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:04,329
because why the fuck even after

409
00:13:04,329 --> 00:13:06,040
crazy-eyed samuel l.jackson shows up

410
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,630
with a goddamn knife for a hand movie

411
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:09,339
continues to be fucking mind-numbing

412
00:13:09,339 --> 00:13:11,170
here's invisible boy closing some

413
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:12,670
shutters continuing to be utterly wasted

414
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:15,190
by this movie jake has a clean shot here

415
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:16,480
but realizes there's another thirty

416
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,709
minutes left in this fucking thing and

417
00:13:17,709 --> 00:13:18,970
refuses to mercifully shorten the

418
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:19,510
runtime

419
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:21,579
Emma can float in control air but will

420
00:13:21,579 --> 00:13:23,140
be dangerously sliding down a wet roof

421
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,730
in the scene listen I don't even care if

422
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:25,720
somehow I'm making a sunken ship

423
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,519
seaworthy is something that Emma can do

424
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:28,870
I just wish there would have been some

425
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,070
indication that our powers were this

426
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:31,720
impressive ship that still has a massive

427
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,010
hole in it is able to float effortlessly

428
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:35,440
and the waterlogged coal is able to burn

429
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,450
his fuel that's science kids there's a

430
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,459
loop here in blackboard with Miss Avocet

431
00:13:39,459 --> 00:13:41,620
gone one two loop closed why hasn't it

432
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,100
already

433
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,690
miss avocets been away from it at least

434
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,790
a day goddamn now the movie is making me

435
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,410
actively cognitively engaged with why I

436
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:50,290
hate it if we kill baron he'll be gone

437
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:52,690
but time will carry on he won't go to

438
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:56,950
Florida Abe won't die he's probably not

439
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:58,450
considering if Baron dies there's a

440
00:13:58,450 --> 00:13:59,620
massive chain of events that will be

441
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,300
affected and Jake may never even be

442
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,800
conceived pretty sure he's not thinking

443
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,510
forth dimensionally luckily for the

444
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,190
secrecy of the peculiars no one is

445
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:07,630
around to see this previously sunken

446
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:10,930
ship docking this can't be it can be

447
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:13,240
anyway only balls miss Emerson sucked it

448
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,920
in Breen not only is the loop entrance

449
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,360
in plain sight but the loop itself is at

450
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,890
a goddamn crowded amusement park that

451
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,360
just opened was she trying to get caught

452
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,000
in cocksucking balls the fact that these

453
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,380
skeletons were perfectly placed in the

454
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,850
dining room is the only way Enochs

455
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:27,310
ability could be used and it bullsh some

456
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:28,779
ass muggles stand around looking at the

457
00:14:28,779 --> 00:14:30,220
enormous probably dangerous creatures

458
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,449
instead of getting the fuck out of the

459
00:14:31,449 --> 00:14:33,010
way these hollows were previously shown

460
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:34,360
to be the most dangerous things in the

461
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,279
world but are now reduced to clunky set

462
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:37,660
pieces waving their arms around in the

463
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,160
final fight because we need to see more

464
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,779
of this remaster clip from jason and the

465
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:42,570
argonauts

466
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:44,860
Olive is able to set huge fires were

467
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,149
there touch but only lightly ignites

468
00:14:46,149 --> 00:14:48,790
Barron's coat

469
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,990
rather than immediately assault you with

470
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,700
this bowling pin hang on while I find a

471
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,529
random viable heart and make a minion

472
00:14:54,529 --> 00:14:56,060
out of this animatronic elephant that

473
00:14:56,060 --> 00:15:00,920
will become slowly sentient Jesus I

474
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,390
think samuel l.jackson now charges by

475
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:06,500
the exclamation let me say for what

476
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,170
seems like the 1450 second time since I

477
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:10,760
started watching this final act why

478
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,899
didn't they do that at the beginning of

479
00:15:11,899 --> 00:15:13,790
this fight ten extra sins for all the

480
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:14,660
times they should have done something

481
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:20,149
sooner rather than shooting another air

482
00:15:20,149 --> 00:15:21,920
load at Barron Emmet runs away so we can

483
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,040
have a final unnecessary conflict sudden

484
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,990
hatchet hand is sudden and here we are

485
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:28,820
with only our wits and our will to

486
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,440
sustain us when you signed up for this

487
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,760
movie did you really think the finale

488
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,350
would be about literal birds being led

489
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,790
out of their cages where the did the

490
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:36,290
police go they were just investigating

491
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:37,820
on the mayhem a few minutes ago I know

492
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,260
it feels like the last scene took

493
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,970
forever but it wasn't that long these

494
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:42,380
assholes are seriously derelict in their

495
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,029
duties wait Jake was in England with a

496
00:15:44,029 --> 00:15:45,470
loop closed if his grandpa didn't die

497
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:47,209
and Baron dr. Golan didn't exist there

498
00:15:47,209 --> 00:15:48,830
would be no reason for his trip overseas

499
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:50,209
somehow the did he get all the way back

500
00:15:50,209 --> 00:15:52,070
to Florida okay did we establish whether

501
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:53,450
or not Abe had a relationship with Emma

502
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:55,550
but strongly implied he did so not only

503
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,900
should it be weird that Jake's hooking

504
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:57,800
up with his grandpa Seth's girlfriend

505
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,690
should be extra weird for Emma to use

506
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:05,769
Jake as their sloppy seconds

507
00:16:05,769 --> 00:16:12,589
tell me your sins my son can you tell me

508
00:16:12,589 --> 00:16:16,129
a story when I was in prison second time

509
00:16:16,129 --> 00:16:19,040
no third stretch yep there was this

510
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,829
screw what really had it in for me and

511
00:16:21,829 --> 00:16:24,529
that geezer was top of my list I could

512
00:16:24,529 --> 00:16:26,179
have gone up behind him and snapped his

513
00:16:26,179 --> 00:16:34,189
fucking neck by lefty or baby squirrel

514
00:16:34,189 --> 00:16:36,679
and we'd have to send away for some

515
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:39,880
special really tiny instruments

516
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:47,930
[Music]

517
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:50,579
if you can dodge the wrench you can

518
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:58,639
dodge a ball play with this daddy

519
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:04,380
it is 1943 September the 3rd 1943 all

520
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,669
day every day

521
00:17:05,669 --> 00:17:10,000
I wake up every day right here
