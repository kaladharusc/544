1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,490
what's up ladies and gentlemen of

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:04,440
YouTube boogie2988 coming at your levels

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,089
again through the power of the Internet

4
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:10,700
and this is our currently untitled

5
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,200
podcast project now I will tell you at

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,429
some point we talked about just calling

7
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:16,619
it the big breakfast podcast but we

8
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:18,480
opted not to do that I think as of right

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,160
now we're talking about the Boogie

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,660
Nights podcast which is an old name I

11
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,310
used to use for the channel that's the

12
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,350
Boogie Nights shield there behind me for

13
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,859
those who have never seen that but the

14
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:31,439
problem is it's 2018 and I think the

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,480
term Nights has a negative connotation

16
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,000
now doesn't it like it's I don't know I

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,579
I I will tell you this we have now

18
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:40,140
thrown it out to you guys to see what

19
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,000
kind of names you have suggested and I

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,050
will read some of those that we've seen

21
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,550
on Twitter I would love to know if you

22
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,020
guys have some suggestions for names in

23
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,370
the comment section below but let me

24
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,190
start you off by introducing you to the

25
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,899
boys over there at big underscore

26
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:54,449
breakfast on twitch TV we'll start off

27
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:55,829
with a good friend Jacob Jacob we've

28
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:58,739
known each other about how long no five

29
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:00,329
or six years you know we met over a game

30
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:02,250
of magic if I remember correctly that's

31
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,860
absolutely right and we've been playing

32
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,740
magic I guess often on the weekends for

33
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:09,119
Ally a long time so what is it you do

34
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,090
over there on Twitch well we basically

35
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,400
do this we kind of have conversations we

36
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,290
talk to each other we talk to our our

37
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:18,420
viewers we like to answer weird

38
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,360
questions the weirder the better oh yeah

39
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,090
int I would also like to add I have an

40
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,009
idea for the name oh we're all listening

41
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:29,340
I guess the big stack Oh like like a

42
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,380
stack of pancakes like a stack of

43
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,579
pancakes kind of like that it's out

44
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:37,890
there we'll talk about it and so Jacob

45
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:38,880
tell him a little bit about you what

46
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,259
kind of I see your game or what kind of

47
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:42,570
video games you like to play I like to

48
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,399
play a little bit of everything I mostly

49
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,689
like strategy and shooter games but my

50
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:50,670
favorite game is Binding of Isaac I

51
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,590
thought was the most hours into that so

52
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,869
the game I'm super excited about new

53
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:57,930
content coming up oh yeah well I I got a

54
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:00,659
little bit of a preview actually back

55
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:03,299
the I actually backed the card game so

56
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:05,219
that should be at my house very very

57
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:07,079
soon we'll be able to play the by night

58
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:09,539
Isaac there's a binding of issac card

59
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:12,120
game coming yeah I guess that is my jam

60
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,560
it's so yeah well bye

61
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,050
I think it's not stop playing card so

62
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:17,910
Eddie and I have talked a little bit I

63
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,470
guess I should say you know for the

64
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,450
effort of full disclosure me and ahead

65
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:22,709
of talk a little bit we're not friends

66
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:25,920
but we are friendly and I wouldn't

67
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,030
wanted to help promote his game a little

68
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,800
bit when I backed it so I guess this

69
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,090
counts as promotion or something like

70
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,350
that for a friend so you should know

71
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:34,020
that ahead of time that said the the

72
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,610
project looked really interesting but I

73
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,230
didn't look deep dive too much into it

74
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:39,360
it kind of looks like a deck building

75
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,760
game it kind of looks i but I didn't I'm

76
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,410
like man I just anything he promotes

77
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:44,940
anything he builds with Binding of Isaac

78
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:48,300
I'm going to invested so I got like the

79
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,790
$200 signed edition with like all the

80
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:53,550
extras and then the cool stuff and it's

81
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,260
my believe it or not it was my very

82
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,269
first Kickstarter project I've never

83
00:02:57,269 --> 00:03:00,420
kicked started anything ever but because

84
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,280
I feel like I know the guy because I'm

85
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,080
such a loyalist who is his products

86
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,760
whether it's Meat Boy or whether it's a

87
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,050
binding of issac or anything else that

88
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,880
he's created what was that one game that

89
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,830
went like nobody seemed to notice the

90
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,380
one you could play the Angels I yeah the

91
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,000
end is nigh that's now available and

92
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,650
switch by the way which I need to pick

93
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:18,450
up UPS which I played it on PC and I

94
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:20,130
strained at Mattias is like what is this

95
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:21,000
and I'm like all this made about the

96
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,110
gaia binding of issac and they're all

97
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,700
like well then play binding of issac

98
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,880
instead why are you playing there's a

99
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,130
the game was it was it another there's a

100
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:32,579
platformer and it was kind of like Meat

101
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:34,799
Boy kind of inspired in some ways but it

102
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,049
had like this really dark storyline to

103
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:39,030
it and it was playable in like multiple

104
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,380
different ways like if you just wanted

105
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,489
to get through the game and hear the

106
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:43,260
story that was possible which you really

107
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,700
couldn't do with like Meat Boy like you

108
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,769
had to be good to play Meat Boy was hard

109
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:49,049
right Super Meat Boy but this game there

110
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:50,760
is past where you could easily take it

111
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,709
and it wasn't too difficult but if you

112
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:53,850
wanted to get all the collectables if

113
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:55,140
you wanted to explore every level if you

114
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,489
wanted to get every cutscene and all the

115
00:03:56,489 --> 00:03:58,920
little weird details then you had that

116
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,170
option and I don't know why I don't know

117
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:02,489
why that game didn't perform as well as

118
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:03,690
I would have expected it to I thought

119
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:05,120
that was gonna be the next speed runner

120
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,769
awesome yeah and it just wasn't right so

121
00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:12,859
then we have my good friend Ellis Ellis

122
00:04:12,859 --> 00:04:15,720
so what is it the so you were you're

123
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,039
pretty much the weirdest one over there

124
00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:18,840
on Twitch I think because when I watched

125
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,329
it the twitch streams I am often I'm

126
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:24,630
often like this consciously weird you

127
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,580
know coming from you I don't really know

128
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,000
how to

129
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,070
oh you should take that you should see

130
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:32,100
that's the worst here's my biggest it

131
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,220
calls me weird here's here's the thing

132
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,020
these guys have known me so long they

133
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,640
have watched my evolution on YouTube

134
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,680
where I went from guy eating meat

135
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,780
shirtless and doing fruit salads those

136
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,880
videos are still available here on

137
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,410
YouTube I'm proud of those videos to

138
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:47,970
some extent but they've known me on a

139
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:50,040
very personal level so when I'm setting

140
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,630
around drafting magic and I say

141
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:54,480
something stupid just I want to be the

142
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,450
Chief of Police they're just so used to

143
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:00,420
my brain not working they come over on a

144
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,220
Friday or Saturday night and they're

145
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,450
like what are you doing today but it's

146
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:05,400
like oh I don't know just thinking about

147
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,500
how great it'll be to die one day you

148
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,620
guys want a draft magic not now not now

149
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,820
you know I just kind of want to go home

150
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:20,910
your difficult friend but Ellis also a

151
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:23,070
gamer someone has played magic with me

152
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,419
quite a bit I think that's how we met

153
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:26,190
you you came down and played some magic

154
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,290
with some friends at our local gaming

155
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:30,390
store brought some magic cards off of me

156
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,580
and did poorly with them I should I did

157
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:35,700
so bad yeah you hate me bad cards they

158
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,980
were cursed to this day no it's not to

159
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,600
this day I still have Liliana the veils

160
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,910
and snap casters that you borrowed that

161
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:43,680
feel bad about themselves because they

162
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,700
were like snap casting I know you're

163
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,890
just like can I borrow $8,000 for the

164
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:51,419

166
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:57,720

167
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,850

168
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:02,430
hadn't played in got like four or five

169
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,990
blocks or something like that not since

170
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:06,660
high school and I was like oh these are

171
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,280
these are good cards I'll play with

172
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,169
these I'll do fine and then I was

173
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:12,750
probably like snap castering mil you

174
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,030
three years yeah exactly yeah yeah it

175
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:17,610
was bad it was not good so as a video

176
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:20,729
gamer what do you like well since I'm

177
00:06:20,729 --> 00:06:22,740
you know such a great magic player I

178
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:25,500
like card games I play basically every

179
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,479
card game that I can get my hands on so

180
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:29,790
how does that like yeah I played a lot

181
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,229
of hearthstone not as much anymore I

182
00:06:31,229 --> 00:06:32,580
hadn't played that much what about

183
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,810
eternal decide to ever get you a new

184
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,669
eternal plate a lot of eternal yep

185
00:06:35,669 --> 00:06:36,750
absolutely

186
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,400
now you're playing a lot of magic the

187
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,160
gaming arena just playing arena B

188
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,020
it's so accessible it's got some

189
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,430
problems I'm not a huge fan of the

190
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,930
client but hopefully it'll get better

191
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:47,720
it's still in beta so as it evolves

192
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,490
hopefully we'll get to a place but I

193
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:51,260
want why don't we have a friends list in

194
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,810
that client because they that's less

195
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:55,730
than social game right likewise there's

196
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,770
not clan so is there not anything social

197
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:59,060
right yeah we're meeting a friends list

198
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,010
next week I think that's good

199
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:02,900
kinda I think I don't think it's not

200
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,120
going further but that should that be

201
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,980
like social engineering 101 shouldn't

202
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,270
you have done that from the very

203
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,340
beginning there's no reason that should

204
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,380
not have already been in the game and if

205
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,780
like during closed alpha maybe they were

206
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,940
concerned with like actual security

207
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,950
concerns because you have got some kind

208
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,930
of like connection maybe between people

209
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:23,690
I'm not a networking expert but as soon

210
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:25,190
as that game hit open beta I can't

211
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:27,620
believe it like I know that I'm overly

212
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,940
critical of Wizards of the coast but I

213
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,950
feel this is where the entitled gamer

214
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,930
argument comes into play a lot and I

215
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:34,370
always feel like I'm entitled when it

216
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,630
comes to Wizards of the coast because

217
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,400
I've been playing the game for 25 years

218
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,990
I've been buying thousands of dollars

219
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:40,520
for the magic cards every single year I

220
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,200
support them I buy their side products I

221
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,790
buy their main products I don't buy

222
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:45,920
singles I buy boxes I draft I draft

223
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,630
online I drafted in real life I Drive I

224
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,490
build a cube so that's probably one of

225
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:50,930
the worst things I do I play commander a

226
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:54,170
little bit I've got the modern cards

227
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:55,669
I've got in Legacy Collection I've been

228
00:07:55,669 --> 00:07:57,350
playing this game since the beginning of

229
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:59,660
time and so I always feel like I deserve

230
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,790
to be overly critical because I'm going

231
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:03,860
to buy the next project I just put in

232
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:06,020
this is what kind of monster I am and

233
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,250
for those of you don't follow magic I

234
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,870
know this is kind of boring this is kind

235
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,490
of monster I am I just pre-ordered a

236
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:15,080
case of ultimate masters that's a lot of

237
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,380
money is a lot of human it's it's more

238
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,390
than my mortgage I couldn't believe it I

239
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,530
went to my local gaming store I'm like

240
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:22,730
what kind of discount can you give me

241
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,680
because I have to make some profit I'm

242
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,520
like I got it and it's for those who

243
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,800
don't know um the new manage the

244
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,390
gathering set which is already Magic the

245
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,770
Gathering is a premium product right at

246
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,510
$99 a box which is what we're used to

247
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:37,550
paying all right most people can't

248
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,620
afford $99 a box for magic cards most

249
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,229
people can't afford 120 bucks for a

250
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:44,000
tarmogoyf so then they need four of

251
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,740
those for modern the humans deck is a

252
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,170
thousand dollar deck $1500 deck you want

253
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:50,300
to play modern it's a it's an expensive

254
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,760
game and so all of us players always

255
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,089
constantly can

256
00:08:54,089 --> 00:08:55,620
or mad about how expensive the game is

257
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,720
the newest set that's coming up which is

258
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:02,339
a reprint set of premium cards 338

259
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:03,110
dollars

260
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:07,019
MSRP is it at least a full size booster

261
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:11,970
box no it's only 24 bucks resistors and

262
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:13,290
so here's what's crazy it's a premium

263
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:15,029
set if those you don't know there's been

264
00:09:15,029 --> 00:09:16,980
most must ersatz before but this

265
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,769
ultimate master said everybody's like

266
00:09:19,769 --> 00:09:22,259
the first master set was $6.99 a booster

267
00:09:22,259 --> 00:09:24,360
right but it had some premium reprints

268
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,100
so everybody's excited to pay that then

269
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,779
they raised it to $10 a booster never

270
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:29,519
buddies like you should take it back

271
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,439
down to $7 a booster and they said you

272
00:09:31,439 --> 00:09:33,360
know what we will but then we'll double

273
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,689
it let's go for $14.99 $15 a booster

274
00:09:36,689 --> 00:09:39,509
that is why and the company could not be

275
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:41,309
more out of touch and it happened to the

276
00:09:41,309 --> 00:09:43,589
same week as Diablo immortals so magic

277
00:09:43,589 --> 00:09:45,509
players that also play Diablo we're

278
00:09:45,509 --> 00:09:47,279
having one of the worst weeks of their

279
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,430
lives but to bring it back to bring back

280
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:52,860
Ellis well besides card games what else

281
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,319
do you play I like a lot of survival

282
00:09:55,319 --> 00:09:57,029
games colonies in games basically

283
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:59,730
anything that's kind of strategic and

284
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:01,499
lets me like out think an opponent or

285
00:10:01,499 --> 00:10:04,920
out think of an AI or at least pretend

286
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,949
and feel good about the way I'm letting

287
00:10:07,949 --> 00:10:12,269
me out think it right but yeah I'm I'm

288

the Twitter is just a place where I

317
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:15,930
commit some some form of self-harm most

318
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:19,890

00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:31,140
thirty years ago a lot of the stuff that

324
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,090
they teach now is very different what we

325
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:35,400
taught then American values whatever you

326
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,660
know the whole Christopher Columbus

327
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,310
thing all kinds of stuff that I need to

328
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:39,720
get educated on things that I am

329
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,090
learning so I will say that most of the

330
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:43,470
time the disconnect comes from I'm

331
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,090
tremendously old and you're starting to

332
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:47,940
feel it at 28 Jacob you're 28 as well 27

333
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,520
yeah okay you guys are starting to feel

334
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,100
it but once you're 40 the world is come

335
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,200
at this pace the world has changed in my

336
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,900
lifetime it's so bizarre

337
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,370
I don't know what's going on I don't

338
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:01,200
know what's happening I'm confused all

339
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,850
the time I say something that I was

340
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:04,500
taught in high school turns out to be

341
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:04,950
wrong

342
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:07,140
I feel like an idiot but someone once

343
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,870
said to me a long time ago I was selling

344
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:12,210
with my grandfather and my grandfather

345
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:13,950
set down the remote and said something

346
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:16,020
horrible horribly racist horribly racist

347
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,940
which I won't repeat here but he says me

348
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,260
and sometimes I don't even recognize the

349
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,690
world anymore and I thought to myself

350
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:23,520
even at a young age I was probably 10 or

351
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,680
12 I thought of myself and that a good

352
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,740
thing right like if the world changes

353
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:30,390
progressively for the better so much

354
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:32,010
that an old man like me doesn't

355
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:33,690
recognize it doesn't understand it

356
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:35,970
doesn't understand you whippersnappers

357
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:37,470
values that's probably a good thing

358
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:38,070
right

359
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:40,650
I should be confused by now and if I'm

360
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:41,970
not in the world hasn't changed very

361
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,650
much and that kind of sucks I'm all for

362
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:46,020
change I'm all for progression I'm not

363
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:48,480
for the kind of change we've seen in

364
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,240
Magic the Gathering products going to

365
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,000
$300 a box I don't know how they can do

366
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,320
that because they're not allowed to

367
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,080
acknowledge the secondary market but the

368
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,430
only reason that those cards are

369
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:01,020
expensive and that they can charge so

370
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:03,150
much is because of the secondary market

371
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:05,640
why yeah and that's so frustrating

372
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,080
because they say they don't pay any

373
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,630
attention to it but then they rare shift

374
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,840
something from common to rare or

375
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:15,930
uncommon to rare rare to mythic or what

376
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:18,720
was the worst case scenario yeah we had

377
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,130
something that went from uncommon

378
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:21,420
I think was a land wasn't it was an

379
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,820
ancient tomb or something like that

380
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,610
well in or they've done that with ether

381
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:29,640
vile I think yeah and then in the last

382
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,950
corset the the last mainline set that

383
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:33,810
had this happen palaka worm went from

384
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:37,080
uncommon to rare yeah that's fine right

385
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,790
pop worm is not worth no fuck worm is

386
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:41,850
great but it should see the card or when

387
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:44,070
in the rise of mobile gaming I love the

388
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:45,690
concept of mobile game when I got my

389
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:48,510
first tablet I downloaded like a Spider

390
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:50,520
Man game and it was like a traditional

391
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,080
game for like 15 bucks and I'm like this

392
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,610
is terrible it looks like ps1 graphics

393
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:56,280
but it's good I mean it's a game I can't

394
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,840
wait for mobile gaming to be able to

395
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,420
play mobile games on a tablet it's gonna

396
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,230
be so much fun

397
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:03,420
never in my life did I realize they were

398
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,040
going to monetize things the way they

399
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,750
have monetized things never in my life

400
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:10,080
did I expect them to you know I play a

401
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,370
couple mobile games you guys play any

402
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:12,570
mobile games at all Jacob do you play

403
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:15,300
any yeah what if you what do you play I

404
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,860
bounced around from different games I

405
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,200
like little Arkady ones I play one right

406
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,230
now called drop wizard and it's got NES

407
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:23,640
graphics and you your little wizard you

408
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:27,420
walk around for the gotcha games

409
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:30,000
what do you mean gotcha so gotcha pond

410
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,570
is like the Japanese concept no let me

411
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:36,420
learn it's it's like a claw machine

412
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,880
right so gotcha games are the ones where

413
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,500
you don't get your full cast of

414
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,450
characters you've got a spin premium

415
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:44,430
currency and then you roll something and

416
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:48,480
maybe you get the five-star hero oh I do

417
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,550
a lot of these hero arenas I started

418
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,830
with summoner Wars or monsters some are

419
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:54,330
first up s'mores as the Gacha gate right

420
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:56,310
so I do this I do like the Star Wars one

421
00:14:56,310 --> 00:15:00,270
I do Marvel Strikeforce and I will tell

422
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,260
you that at the beginning when I first

423
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,670
played like summoner Wars or whatever

424
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:03,810
that one's call the one where you battle

425
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:05,280
like monsters you have to get runes and

426
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,960
so I ain't have spent like a hundred

427
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,040
bucks on that game thinking you know

428
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,530
what I'm really into it I'll spend one

429
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:13,200
I'll buy one expensive package and it

430
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,460
didn't change anything

431
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,410
my monsters were that much better I

432
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:18,510
didn't vote me like a month's worth of

433
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:19,800
grinding but that's it

434
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,420
but then I was still doing the same

435
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,100
stuff over and over again same with the

436
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,530
the the the EA game that I play the the

437
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:27,060
stupid Star Wars one Africa do you know

438
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,370
the name of that one the hero's galaxy

439
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:30,960
if heroes out sea of heroes yeah I

440
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,440
played that one every day

441
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,240
I play Marvel Strikeforce every day I

442
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,740
grind through it as I'm falling asleep

443
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:38,710
at night and I have not spent any money

444
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:42,520
on I did spend money on the EA one right

445
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,600
at the beginning us feel like 20 bucks

446
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,850
to get like a Darth Vader shards like

447
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:48,250
right away right and then for the Marvel

448
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,540
Strikeforce I've never spent a dime

449
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,160
because these games are designed to

450
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,320
where even if you do it doesn't advance

451
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:57,190
you same with them the the that one of

452
00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:00,280
the more famous some named some of the

453
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,750
most famous mobile games I'm trying to

454
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,650
think of the name of this one

455
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:04,420
I mean it's clash of clans right clash

456
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,310
of clans it's the card variant version

457
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:08,080
of clash of clans clash Royale clash

458
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,300
Royale again if you spend money in that

459
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,830
game you just get paired with people who

460
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:14,290
have spent money so it's pointless to

461
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:15,850
spend money in those games which is

462
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:18,430
great but the grind is not particularly

463
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:19,660
funny there I don't know what is it

464
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,280
what's so addicting about those games

465
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,950
why do I play the filling bars you know

466
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,270
pulling that roulette wheel it's

467
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:27,880
gambling right yes that's how they get

468
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,800
you a lot of the time and if an you're

469
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,450
absolutely right you don't get a lot of

470
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:33,250
fresh we'll return for your money but

471
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,230
you get that sweet feeling of them

472
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,460
holding the slot machine

473
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,840
oh I now have a maxed out Darth Vader

474
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,490
this is great he's got all the gear he's

475
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:40,870
got all the loot oh now I'm farming his

476
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,010
room now he's got the best ruins of the

477
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:43,990
game oh my god he's so great who cares

478
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:45,640
and now I'm just getting paired he gets

479
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,960
the same monsters over and over again in

480
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,760
the same arena and so I'm the top500 for

481
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,960
eNOS I'm the top hunter for space

483
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,920

484
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,660
what my addiction is here's here's the

485
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:58,720
other thing I really don't get um about

486
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,460
what the way these games are designed I

487
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,470
don't know what the fun part is I don't

488
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:04,569
really know it's yeah I really think it

489
00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:07,209
is built entirely on that addictive

490
00:17:07,209 --> 00:17:10,270
quality it really is you know anybody

491
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:12,189
else will just walk away and so that the

492
00:17:12,189 --> 00:17:13,870
reason I bring this topic up is because

493
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:14,860
I want to talk to you guys a little bit

494
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:18,370
about Diablo immortal which I'm roughly

495
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,800
devil's advocate here right now if you

496
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,780
haven't watched you play have you

497
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:25,930
watched any of the game time yes yeah

498
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:28,840
I've seen so what what they showed ya

499
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,640
right and so there there was somebody

500
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,410
who got to play it in stream and at

501
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:34,630
Blizzcon they streamed about an hour of

502
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:37,330
it and the gameplay does not look as

503
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:40,210
good as well-rounded Diablo 3 certainly

504
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:45,420
um but it does look pretty deep for

505
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:48,300
one of these um mobile games and so I

506
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,220
think I'll download and give it a chance

507
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,990
but what I'm worried about is how

508
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:53,880
they're going to monetize it because

509
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,680
Diablo has always been ripe and I think

510
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,760
I think this has been one of the biggest

511
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,640
disconnects for the media to understand

512
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,320
Diablo has always been right for

513
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,490
monetization and they tried it with

514
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:03,870
Diablo 3 at the launch for those of you

515
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:05,490
want around for that they tried to put a

516
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,050
real money auction house in there where

517
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:08,490
you could buy and sell the items you

518
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:11,460
picked up for real money and then they

519
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,190
would take a cut of the real money

520
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:16,170
obviously players weren't having that

521
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:19,770
but now with with the the gambling

522
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:21,420
aspect what if you get a daily chest

523
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,740
that has items that it might have an

524
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,720
artifact if you upgrade what if they

525
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,060
give you an opportunity to increase

526
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:30,420
magic find in for a day you could do

527
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,640
that with Diablo 4 as well certainly but

528
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,980
it would be more acceptable to people

529
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,540
who are used to playing mobile games who

530
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:39,390
are used to playing spend $100 and get

531
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:42,510
no real advancement from it and so I

532
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:44,190
think that's my biggest concern is is

533
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,620
how they're gonna monetize Diablo

534
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,700
immortal now I will tell you this and

535
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,160
this is not devil's advocacy this is my

536
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,700
honest to god verse if you sell me

537
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:57,020
Diablo immortal for 10 bucks maybe 20

538
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:00,960
maybe even 30 if it's deep enough and

539
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,590
you don't monetize it outside of that I

540
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:06,180
would celebrate that game I would play

541
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,950
it I would stream it I would tell people

542
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,390
to give it a chance because it would

543
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:10,890
change the mobile market the problem is

544
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:12,560
they're not going to do that

545
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,580
what's the name of the company that

546
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:18,090
developed this game is it Netezza yes

547
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:21,330
and they are known for the exact same

548
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:24,060
kind of greasy grimy monetization

549
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:26,010
practices that plague most mobile games

550
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:28,080
right and I and and that's certainly you

551
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,820
know the folks at Blizzard obviously

552
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,980
have editorial control here and I think

553
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:35,160
if we as consumers put pressure on them

554
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,170
not the kind of toxic pressure we saw

555
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:38,910
after that release I don't think any of

556
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:40,650
the threatening developers on Twitter I

557
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:42,060
don't think colleagues evil name

558
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:45,300
obviously obviously we all openly

559
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,620
condemn that kind of behavior

560
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,180
absolutely what that's saying making the

561
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,840
request of hey monetize this fairly hey

562
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,770
monetize this in a way that's that's

563
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:54,930
decent if it's a playable game if it's a

564
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:56,640
decent game and it's monetized correctly

565
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,770
then we're not as upset anymore but the

566
00:19:58,770 --> 00:19:59,640
problem is I think

567
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,810
I think they have an understanding

568
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:02,940
number one I think a lot of people here

569
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,070
in the West don't understand this mobile

570
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:08,640
gaming has one in the East and the Asian

571
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,290
markets mobile gaming is all theirs

572
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:12,720
consoles are dead the switch has some

573
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,600
foothold there but most gaming in Asian

574
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,500
markets now has done on phones and and

575
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,600
and they spend money on micro

576
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,010
transactions like its water like it's

577
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:24,870
just part of gaming and then we've seen

578
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:27,120
a lot of newer gamers who've come in

579
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,370
younger kids or people who aren't

580
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:31,260
primarily gamers you know games for non

581
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,630
gamers like candy crush we've seen

582
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:35,220
people spend tremendous amounts of money

583
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,230
on those games because mm-hmm it's their

584
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:39,030
first time ever doing it I went to the

585
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:41,520
arcades as a kid I despised plunking

586
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,870
quarters into the thing but I did it

587
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:44,910
once I could start gaming at home for

588
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,920
one small price that's what I prefer to

589
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,960
do those guys have never experienced

590
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,490
that so they're just used to plunking

591
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:52,740
dollar bills into their phone you don't

592
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,360
know something and so whereas somebody

593
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:57,150
like me who grew up in a time like the

594
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:59,100
64 was the first console that I really

595
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,870
remember releasing in my lifetime and

596
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:02,850
back then I mean you got a game for 40

597
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:05,250
bucks and that was it you just had the

598
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,900
game there was no DLC there was no micro

599
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,880
transactions so now even though I

600
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,530
understand that it's profitable and that

601
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:12,690
that's the way that this market has

602
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:15,690
moved it's hard for me not to feel bad

603
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:17,820
about it you know it feels predatory in

604
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:20,280
ways these things are designed and it is

605
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,370
and you know at the end of the day like

606
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:24,960
it's a business I understand that it's a

607
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,300
business but um and I understand that

608
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,130
they have shareholders so they have to

609
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:31,350
please and they have to bring in record

610
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:32,700
profits they have to show record growth

611
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,620
every year but that's one of the reasons

612
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:37,410
I I dive into so many independent games

613
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:38,880
to bring it back to biding of issac

614
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,260
that's one of the reasons I love binding

615
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,700
of issac so much cuz that's just a

616
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,560
handful of guys in an apartment in a

617
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,330
garage building those games in a small

618
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:47,970
office man and I think what he loves

619
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:49,350
right it's one of the best games I've

620
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:51,720
ever played and and I know when I spend

621
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:55,550
money there he's not there to to try to

622
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:57,750
exploit me he's not there to try to

623
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,400
drain my wallet I'm not a whale to him

624
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,070
I'm a player to him you know I'm like I

625
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,150
said I've talked to him now on Twitter a

626
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:04,410
couple of times so I should probably be

627
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:05,970
careful what I say but let's go with any

628
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:07,590
other indie game name what was one of

629
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:08,820
your favorite indie games from this year

630
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:12,810
if you played anything loved oh it's

631
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:13,480
incredible I

632
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,030
so good it's it's so funny because a lot

633
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:17,860
of people I've seen say well that game

634
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:19,480
would never gotten played were not for

635
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,669
the controversy you are probably correct

636
00:22:21,669 --> 00:22:22,929
because that guy did not have a

637
00:22:22,929 --> 00:22:25,480
marketing budget he designed an

638
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,610
incredible game now I only played it one

639
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:30,429
full time through I stopped playing it

640
00:22:30,429 --> 00:22:32,260
by the time I beat the boss the second

641
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,850
time how many play throughs did you do

642
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:36,520
I'm curious um I played through I think

643
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,610
two times but as a counterpoint to that

644
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:41,500
game would not have been played without

645
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,450
the controversy I don't even know what

646
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:45,280
it is I can never even heard the

647
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,370
controversy really yeah so why didn't

648
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:50,110
you bring it up no it's so much it's not

649
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,160
something you want to talk about no it's

650
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,809
a very mild controversy basically a

651
00:22:52,809 --> 00:22:56,049
somebody at I believe it was IGN

652
00:22:56,049 --> 00:22:57,940
I think that was IG and you guys let me

653
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,040
know in the comment section below but

654
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:02,080
reporter IGN was accused of plagiarizing

655
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:06,850
a youtubers video for the review so it

656
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:09,010
wasn't it wasn't word-for-word but it

657
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:10,870
was very very close like this

658
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:14,410
structurally and so when people dovey /

659
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:16,210
it looked like a lot of us other reviews

660
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:18,070
might have been plagiarized as well and

661
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:20,110
so the guy got let go at IGN and they

662
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:22,540
they apologized IGN did a very very good

663
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:24,580
job of fixing things they fired the guy

664
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:25,840
you know they game and I stern

665
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,000
talking-to they had the game reira

666
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,340
viewed and the new review was very

667
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:32,290
careful to be as different as humanly

668
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:33,790
possible like they wouldn't even use the

669
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:36,549
frayed phrase Metroidvania he wouldn't

670
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:38,679
even use the word you know Ali was so

671
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:41,020
adorable how hard he tried and they did

672
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,460
a very very good job with the new video

673
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,919
review but that said that really did

674
00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:46,750
push that game into the forefront of

675
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,880
YouTube for a while and it did much

676
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,830
better that said that game easily could

677
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:53,590
have stood on its own yeah absolutely I

678
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:55,660
played I played it on the switch and the

679
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:56,710
switch version was very good what you

680
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:59,679
guys play it I played on PC how's the PC

681
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:02,320
version very good it's great I've

682
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,820
absolutely no complaints so I love

683
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:05,169
thrown my money at companies like that

684
00:24:05,169 --> 00:24:07,450
especially because dead cells was what

685
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:11,290
25 or was it 20 I got on sale for 15

686
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:12,820
right and even though I only probably

687
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:15,250
put 10 hours into it I feel like I got

688
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:16,299
my money's worth

689
00:24:16,299 --> 00:24:19,299
sure I absolutely did yeah so I don't

690
00:24:19,299 --> 00:24:20,440
want this to be our game of the year

691
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,690
episode but do you have any contenders

692
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:24,340
for game of the year do something

693
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:26,470
because of course I will make my top 10

694
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:26,950
list

695
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:28,060
here I think it's gonna have to be

696
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:29,950
bigger than 10 I might go 15 I think

697
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:32,290
this year and I think I already know

698
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:33,880
what my game of the year is though I

699
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,130
haven't beat Red Dead Redemption to yet

700
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:39,010
I put like 20 hours into it and of

701
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:40,420
course we saw the smash brothers to come

702
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,560
out what are the games that we have to

703
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,880
come out left this year

704
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,670
let's go Pikachu and Evie come out and I

705
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:47,020
think a week there's something like this

706
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,550
smashing the battlefield 5 has not

707
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:50,170
dropped yet we don't officially have

708
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:52,870
fallout 76 yet or did that come out like

709
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:56,050
this week no it comes out next week ok

710
00:24:56,050 --> 00:24:57,820
right well how I'm Shirley I'm I'll be

711
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:00,100
streaming that for sure right did you

712
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:03,040
play the beta 476 at all I did yes I

713
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,210
played a little bit you can play a

714
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:05,170
little more than I did

715
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,610
yeah I think I think you guys had a much

716
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:08,530
more positive experience than I did my

717
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:11,320
game was so buddy not oh did you not I

718
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,690
the game was so buggy for me I wouldn't

719
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:14,530
even draw water

720
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:16,360
I had just giant holes in my map it was

721
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:19,060
insane what was your experience like 476

722
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,140
I don't why I don't want to take away

723
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,370
from Game of the Year conversation but

724
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:23,320
what was your experience for fall of 76

725
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:26,830
well so I played five or six hours of

726
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:30,190
the beta and it was slightly buggy but

727
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:32,110
not any more so than any other Fallout

728
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:35,590
game my problem with it was the writing

729
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:38,380
on some of the NPC's and the way some of

730
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:41,080
the quests were worded they were unclear

731
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:44,260
and I failed quest because I wasn't sure

732
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:46,120
what I was supposed to do I don't want

733
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,380
to I don't want any major spoilers here

734
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,300
for anybody who's planning on playing

735
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,890
this game but I just didn't have a

736
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:52,660
positive experience with the way the

737
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:55,390
quests work and several of the NPCs were

738
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:57,250
people that I didn't want to interact

739
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:59,640
with at all oh that's a shame because

740
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,230
when it's bugs then they can fix that

741
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,430
kind of stuff that thing gets patched

742
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:05,410
out but when it's a fundamental problem

743
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:07,210
with like the gameplay or the way that

744
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:08,260
it's written to the way they have these

745
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,910
quests structured that's not going to

746
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:11,560
change that means that like you're not

747
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,480
how to enjoy the mechanics of that game

748
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,700
I heard I've heard two comparisons um

749
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,770
that I think are accurate the first of

750
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:18,850
which somebody said it was like Fallout

751
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:20,770
4 without the main storyline and just

752
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:23,020
side quests and that feels accurate like

753
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,270
there's no there's no yeah yeah like in

754
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:26,830
my experiences cuz all I did was like

755
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:28,210
tutorial quests for the two and a half

756
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:30,340
hours I played it it was just like hey

757
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,780
go here go to this voting machine go to

758
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,790
this water cleaning machine and then I

759
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:35,020
built a camp and that was kind of fun I

760
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,940
did enjoy collecting junk and

761
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,590
a camp and then like the blueprint

762
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:39,970
system is really smart where you can

763
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:42,640
like you know completely move that camp

764
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,530
and rebuild that camp and yes you're

765
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:46,000
getting grief that's all that was smart

766
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,530
I mean there's some really smart

767
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:49,480
ground-level stuff there but it did

768
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,920
exactly feel like that but it's this is

769
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,440
mostly undeveloped game no main

770
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,040
storyline right yeah and then the second

771
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,990
comparison I heard and I repeated this

772
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:02,230
one to people's chagrin is it also

773
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:04,780
reminds me of sea of thieves in that it

774
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:07,180
just feels underdeveloped and and just

775
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:09,460
not a lot to do there yet with plenty of

776
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:10,990
stuff probably on the horizon and plenty

777
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:13,420
of stuff to come and this far deeper

778
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:16,120
than see if these but the comparison is

779
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:19,030
that it just it's not a finished product

780
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:21,040
and it feels like there's so much more

781
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,260
left for them to do and it could

782
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:24,940
probably use another year in the oven

783
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,140
but it's it's not gonna get it

784
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:28,750
unfortunately know which is which is

785
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:30,640
fine I you know a lot of the articles

786
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,930
I've read and of course you got to be

787
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:34,240
careful this because I mean kota-kun in

788
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,770
polygons they're gonna exaggerate from

789
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:37,870
time to time but you like movement speed

790
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:40,060
and an action speed is tied to frame

791
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,740
rate for this game so the PC version of

792
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,780
is exploitable there and like everything

793
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,550
is supposed to be done client-side so

794
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:47,950
it's very exploitable there so dataone

795
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:50,710
the PC version might not be very fun to

796
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,390
play so you might be better off getting

797
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:53,890
console version which means I won't get

798
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:55,810
it at all probably because I don't want

799
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:57,400
to play on console it seems I don't want

800
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,430
to place stick shooters you know so yeah

801
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:02,110
overall frustrating so it's not gonna be

802
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:03,790
followed 76 what is the best game you've

803
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:06,070
played so far this year monster world

804
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:08,380
monster Ellis tell Mary how many hours

805
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:10,780
you put in the monster underworld 300

806
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:13,270
maybe more good lord I talked to I I

807
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:14,830
made a new friend recently and they said

808
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:18,220
they spent 800 800 hours playing monster

809
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:20,470
have a mind is blown I'm like how I'm

810
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:22,300
late hundred and they lecture that was

811
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,490
idle time that's nice that's what was my

812
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:25,870
first question the answer was none I'm

813
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,630
fairly idle I'm like okay that's insane

814
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:30,130
like that you're obsessive that's

815
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:32,020
obsessive but that's fine if you can get

816
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,490
that kind of enjoyment out of the game

817
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:35,320
high that's the reason I didn't enjoy

818
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,630
Monster Hunter World um because I'm not

819
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:39,370
ready for a grindy game I went back to

820
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:42,070
World of Warcraft this year and I got to

821
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:43,150
the point where it's starting to grind

822
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:44,500
repeating the same content over and over

823
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,210
and again I'm just like no I don't want

824
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:47,620
to repeat the same content I wanted I

825
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:49,150
wanted from Monster Hunter world I

826
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:50,559
wanted to be able to do everything exact

827
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:53,379
once and see it all and then be done but

828
00:28:53,379 --> 00:28:54,460
eventually I got to a point where I

829
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,350
needed to build my armor set and I

830
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:58,899
needed to go into a particular monster

831
00:28:58,899 --> 00:29:01,029
battle so I did the same monster battle

832
00:29:01,029 --> 00:29:02,860
three times a bro trying to get what I

833
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:04,629
needed and oh my god I want to do this

834
00:29:04,629 --> 00:29:07,899
yeah absolutely that's what that's what

835
00:29:07,899 --> 00:29:09,639
the gameplay loop is in that game which

836
00:29:09,639 --> 00:29:11,259
is fine I mean if you're a dick or that

837
00:29:11,259 --> 00:29:12,519
kind of thing or destiny or whatever

838
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:14,110
type or World of Warcraft or whatever

839
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:16,269
kind of grind a game hey I'm still

840
00:29:16,269 --> 00:29:19,029
playing galaxy or Heroes and Marvel

841
00:29:19,029 --> 00:29:21,399
strike force so Who am I to judge you

842
00:29:21,399 --> 00:29:22,990
know Jacob was the best game you play

843
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:25,600
this year well not to copy Ellis's style

844
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,059
but it was monster underworld so I also

845
00:29:28,059 --> 00:29:30,279
put about 300 hours and do it what is it

846
00:29:30,279 --> 00:29:31,840
you liked about Monster Hunter world to

847
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,549
put 300 hours until you guys are busy

848
00:29:33,549 --> 00:29:35,649
guys you guys are busier than me so I

849
00:29:35,649 --> 00:29:39,519
love going from getting my ass kicked by

850
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:42,039
a monster to then kicking that monster's

851
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:44,259
ass and then wearing its skin so that I

852
00:29:44,259 --> 00:29:46,749
can go and fight it again to get even

853
00:29:46,749 --> 00:29:50,759
better at killing it the feeling I get

854
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:53,169
I'm gonna marry you and then I'm gonna

855
00:29:53,169 --> 00:29:56,230
go commit friends hey you remember me

856
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:59,710
I'm wearing your baby's skin what are

857
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:03,009
you talking about yes psychotic no but

858
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:04,929
that sense of achievement of like that

859
00:30:04,929 --> 00:30:06,759
game kicks your ass the first three

860
00:30:06,759 --> 00:30:08,320
times you fight a monster and then when

861
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,610
you beat it it's why people love the

862
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:11,499
souls games right right of course yeah

863
00:30:11,499 --> 00:30:14,919
everything feels so powerful order all

864
00:30:14,919 --> 00:30:17,379
when there's that real challenge to it

865
00:30:17,379 --> 00:30:19,149
and it's so rewarding to beat it exactly

866
00:30:19,149 --> 00:30:21,279
Jacob yeah that's what World of Warcraft

867
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:24,039
used to be and with the vanilla server

868
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:25,149
did you guys play much World of Warcraft

869
00:30:25,149 --> 00:30:27,940
I did I did a while ago yeah yeah so I

870
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:30,309
played I played a little bit in alpha

871
00:30:30,309 --> 00:30:32,200
beta and then I skipped most of vanilla

872
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,340
because I didn't want to grind that much

873
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:35,649
came back for oh the one that took place

874
00:30:35,649 --> 00:30:37,690
on the the red planet what's that one

875
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:39,700
Burning Crusade came back towards the

876
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,619
end of burning curse a just around the

877
00:30:41,619 --> 00:30:43,240
time they dropped heroics and started

878
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,909
like grinding away there did a couple of

879
00:30:45,909 --> 00:30:47,529
raids there then wrath of the lich king

880
00:30:47,529 --> 00:30:50,440
was easily I'm gonna say it and I know

881
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,029
it's gonna be controversial the best

882
00:30:52,029 --> 00:30:54,429
expansion just know it was BC but wrath

883
00:30:54,429 --> 00:30:56,919
was second no over a so because I didn't

884
00:30:56,919 --> 00:30:58,149
play as much of Burning Crusade so maybe

885
00:30:58,149 --> 00:30:58,909
I am wrong

886
00:30:58,909 --> 00:31:02,059
but but rapidly with you I'm with you

887
00:31:02,059 --> 00:31:03,679
boogie I liked Rath way better I love

888
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:05,059
wrath wrath was great

889
00:31:05,059 --> 00:31:07,369
where's new person what is exciting to

890
00:31:07,369 --> 00:31:08,899
me about wrath wasn't just the world

891
00:31:08,899 --> 00:31:10,369
designed the game design the fact that

892
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:11,960
you could fly there the fact that you

893
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,159
could do whatever the hell you wanted

894
00:31:13,159 --> 00:31:15,499
you'd you know the fact that the the

895
00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:16,970
quests were amazing the storyline was

896
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:18,289
amazing that was it it was the storyline

897
00:31:18,289 --> 00:31:22,429
the only story worth telling in all of

898
00:31:22,429 --> 00:31:26,840
Warcraft history to me has been arthas's

899
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:29,210
story and that's why I own Frostmourne

900
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:30,619
well that was a gift from a friend but

901
00:31:30,619 --> 00:31:32,210
still that's why it's one of my favorite

902
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:34,549
stories in videogame ever watching him

903
00:31:34,549 --> 00:31:37,009
lose his shit in Warcraft 3 and then

904
00:31:37,009 --> 00:31:40,129
finally finish him off and it by the way

905
00:31:40,129 --> 00:31:41,090
spoiler alert

906
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:45,139
you have played Warcraft 3 its king or

907
00:31:45,139 --> 00:31:46,549
you deserve a little the Warcraft

908
00:31:46,549 --> 00:31:49,599
expansion a decade ago

909
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:54,590
Arthas is bad guy yeah it's one of the

910
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:55,999
best stories and to actually finally

911
00:31:55,999 --> 00:31:58,249
kill him here's the day I quit World of

912
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:01,220
Warcraft we went into Wrath of the Lich

913
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:03,649
King we went in to fight Arthas and we

914
00:32:03,649 --> 00:32:05,450
failed and we came back and we tried to

915
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:06,799
fight him again and we failed and only

916
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,529
came back a third time and we beat him

917
00:32:09,529 --> 00:32:12,499
and then I logged out and I was done

918
00:32:12,499 --> 00:32:13,879
because that's all I needed

919
00:32:13,879 --> 00:32:15,619
and then I logged back in for mists of

920
00:32:15,619 --> 00:32:18,019
pandaria and I was like this is bad this

921
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:19,220
is bad and then what was the expansion

922
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:21,859
after that like the black mechanically

923
00:32:21,859 --> 00:32:22,789
it was pretty ok

924
00:32:22,789 --> 00:32:24,919
I understand why people didn't like it

925
00:32:24,919 --> 00:32:26,479
well I always liked the pan Barrens but

926
00:32:26,479 --> 00:32:27,979
it just it didn't feel like World of

927
00:32:27,979 --> 00:32:29,809
Warcraft is the thing I always liked the

928
00:32:29,809 --> 00:32:31,849
pan Darren's as a joke character and not

929
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:35,259
a world building exercise you know

930
00:32:35,259 --> 00:32:37,909
developing them as deeply say they did

931
00:32:37,909 --> 00:32:40,609
was not a good decision well and then

932
00:32:40,609 --> 00:32:43,179
what was the next one is a devastation

933
00:32:43,179 --> 00:32:49,519
or a drain that was after Cataclysm

934
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:55,299
then mr. serie then okay right Cataclysm

935
00:32:55,299 --> 00:32:58,009
nobody liked it most people like that

936
00:32:58,009 --> 00:32:59,899
that's when I quit was during Cataclysm

937
00:32:59,899 --> 00:33:04,609
and then I log back into for this new

938
00:33:04,609 --> 00:33:09,320
expansion lead battle for I log back

939
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,389
into that expansion and then I find out

940
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:12,840
there's a giant sword

941
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,789
the world killing it and it's bleeding

942
00:33:14,789 --> 00:33:18,450
as a right and it went full anime style

943
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:20,700
and the gods are all like anime

944
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,169
characters now and I'm like what

945
00:33:22,169 --> 00:33:25,049
happened what happened to world of

946
00:33:25,049 --> 00:33:26,880
warcraft whatever happened to just a

947
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,710
paladin losing his mind and putting on a

948
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:33,720
hat right and now you're stabbing the

949
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,059
earth with a deal they are the Arthas

950
00:33:36,059 --> 00:33:38,880
arc McElveen losses mine and put on a

951
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,610
half what are we doing

952
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:44,580
yeah I don't know man it is it's a

953
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,140
completely different game and so I'm

954
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:48,510
looking for similar reasons

955
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:51,720
so basically battle of Azeroth is not

956
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,279
going to be a mind game of your list I'm

957
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:55,140
sorry

958
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:57,450
so what games did you miss this year

959
00:33:57,450 --> 00:33:59,250
what games did you not play that you

960
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:00,450
think is probably gonna be on people's

961
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:01,590
Game of the Year lists what about you

962
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:03,750
Jacob I missed a lot of games because I

963
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:06,899
only do PC gaming so I don't I didn't

964
00:34:06,899 --> 00:34:09,359
get to play spider-man or god of war or

965
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:12,659
Red Dead Redemption do I feel like those

966
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:15,300
three are gonna be on a lot of people's

967
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,950
lists never dipshit you maybe a little

968
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:19,889
less but people are still way into it

969
00:34:19,889 --> 00:34:21,720
yes boiler alert gotta Wars right up at

970

the top it's I believe it I watched you

971
00:34:24,089 --> 00:34:25,859
play it and it looked like a blast I

972
00:34:25,859 --> 00:34:27,599
don't I have an interesting story to

973
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,849
tell about god of war so um you guys

974
00:34:29,849 --> 00:34:31,919
know I got divorced last year and it was

975
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:34,080
kind of rough and I was like kind of

976
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,639
messed up for a while yeah you might

977
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:37,379
have been aware of what I cried on your

978
00:34:37,379 --> 00:34:39,599
shoulders every Friday and Saturday

979
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:43,530
night for very straight months yeah but

980
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:46,679
I got a war came out I played enough to

981
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:47,520
get an impression

982
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,530
I played enough to get an idea don't

983
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:51,330
like eight hours in but I didn't enjoy

984
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:53,879
any of it I was like this game always

985
00:34:53,879 --> 00:34:55,770
this game's not good but I wasn't

986
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:57,060
playing much of anything other than like

987
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:59,310
stupid Facebook moto style mobile games

988
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:01,320
and like miserable stuff right I was

989
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,550
just like hanging out with you guys were

990
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:03,900
playing like D&amp;D I was like trying to

991
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:04,859
get out of the house every day I was

992
00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:06,089
trying to move more or trying to make

993
00:35:06,089 --> 00:35:08,310
content and I was just kind of just like

994
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:10,830
far cry I kind of enjoyed far cry but I

995
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:12,000
couldn't really get into that either I

996
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,560
beat it it was okay and so after

997
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,430
traveling all throughout the summer and

998
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:19,140
meeting a bunch of fans and hanging out

999
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:21,390
and and and getting better at some point

1000
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:23,580
I think it was August I sat down and I

1001
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:26,339
played the rest of God of War

1002
00:35:26,339 --> 00:35:29,969
and I enjoyed every second of it and I'm

1003
00:35:29,969 --> 00:35:32,460
like oh my god I'm healed like this I'm

1004
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:35,069
like I'm better off like yeah God of War

1005
00:35:35,069 --> 00:35:36,630
like Cory Cory if you're out there if

1006
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:37,680
you're listening to this and I know he

1007
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,160
watches the channel he might holy crap

1008
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,049
did that say that that changed

1009
00:35:43,049 --> 00:35:44,969
everything and so I was right back in

1010
00:35:44,969 --> 00:35:46,559
the gaming and I made up for my back

1011
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:47,999
catalog and I played through everything

1012
00:35:47,999 --> 00:35:49,529
that I missed and I was so excited for

1013
00:35:49,529 --> 00:35:50,849
this gaming season and this gaming

1014
00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:52,079
season has been incredible spider-man I

1015
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:53,940
streamed the entirety of that game

1016
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,739
it's very rare the moths will watch me

1017
00:35:55,739 --> 00:35:56,880
streamed through an entire game on

1018
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,829
Twitch they loved every second of that

1019
00:35:58,829 --> 00:36:00,539
game I can't wait for the DLC was one of

1020
00:36:00,539 --> 00:36:01,559
the best games of the year so yeah you

1021
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:02,849
missed some good stuff Red Dead

1022
00:36:02,849 --> 00:36:11,039
Redemption is very good but it sounds

1023
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:13,349
like it has some things about it that do

1024
00:36:13,349 --> 00:36:14,819
not appeal to me in a video game

1025
00:36:14,819 --> 00:36:17,160
it is a rockstar game right and I feel

1026
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,690
like if you've ever played Grand Theft

1027
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:20,519
Auto if you ever played bully if you've

1028
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:22,769
ever played pretty much any rockstar

1029
00:36:22,769 --> 00:36:24,809
game other than like lemmings you know

1030
00:36:24,809 --> 00:36:26,789
what to expect you're going to get into

1031
00:36:26,789 --> 00:36:29,239
a car or in this case ride a horse

1032
00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:31,920
you're going to ride for five minutes to

1033
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,809
a location you're going to hear some

1034
00:36:33,809 --> 00:36:36,109
really interesting character dialogue

1035
00:36:36,109 --> 00:36:37,979
you're gonna learn to like your

1036
00:36:37,979 --> 00:36:40,079
protagonist you're gonna learn to like

1037
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:41,519
your accessory characters and your

1038
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:42,960
friends and the people he's interacting

1039
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,789
with you're gonna learn a little bit

1040
00:36:44,789 --> 00:36:46,229
about the bad guys and you're going to

1041
00:36:46,229 --> 00:36:47,460
learn to hate them then you're gonna

1042
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:49,319
shoot a bunch of the bad guys you're

1043
00:36:49,319 --> 00:36:51,509
gonna rob a bunch of stuff then you're

1044
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:52,829
gonna get back on a horse and you're

1045
00:36:52,829 --> 00:36:55,170
gonna ride back your town and you're

1046
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:56,579
gonna hear more character dialogue

1047
00:36:56,579 --> 00:36:59,249
developing on what you just saw and then

1048
00:36:59,249 --> 00:37:00,930
you're gonna eat and meet some crazy

1049
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:02,130
characters you're gonna meet some

1050
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:03,890
interesting stuff you're gonna do some

1051
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:06,749
deplorable stuff you're gonna blow up

1052
00:37:06,749 --> 00:37:09,029
innocent people and you're gonna shoot

1053
00:37:09,029 --> 00:37:11,039
stuffing or wreck cars you can or Rob

1054
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:13,170
stuff you're gonna blow up trains you're

1055
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:15,989
gonna kill and murder and pillage and do

1056
00:37:15,989 --> 00:37:18,059
all kinds of miserable stuff and then

1057
00:37:18,059 --> 00:37:19,680
you're gonna learn to like the character

1058
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,910
who's doing that because you're gonna

1059
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:23,130
understand why he's doing it and why

1060
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:24,900
he's the person that it is and then

1061
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,999
they're gonna like you know spoiler

1062
00:37:26,999 --> 00:37:28,349
alert they're gonna make you dislike

1063
00:37:28,349 --> 00:37:29,819
that character by the end of the game on

1064
00:37:29,819 --> 00:37:31,920
some level because otherwise they don't

1065
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,569
want they don't want you liking the bad

1066
00:37:33,569 --> 00:37:34,859
guy they don't want you liking the

1067
00:37:34,859 --> 00:37:36,839
Walter White or the the Rick Sanchez you

1068
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:39,269
know and then you're gonna feel

1069
00:37:39,269 --> 00:37:39,810
conflicted

1070
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:42,360
and then at the end of the game you know

1071
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,400
you're gonna walk away and so it's very

1072
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,750
much that game if you don't like riding

1073
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:46,860
horses and listening to character

1074
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:47,940
dialogue you're not gonna like this game

1075
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,050
and if you don't like shooting galleries

1076
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:50,160
you're definitely not gonna like this

1077
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,830
game how much is it like full-on walking

1078
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:55,410
simulator is it that bad so I've heard a

1079
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:56,580
lot of people compared to a walking

1080
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:58,740
Samuel really I think walking simulator

1081
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:02,130
I think there's nothing else to do even

1082
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:03,540
when I'm just riding that horse I have

1083
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,910
to maintain that horse's attitude

1084
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:07,140
there's an opportunity there to bond

1085
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,700
closer with that horse there's a chance

1086
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,290
to feed that horse that horse is getting

1087
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:11,550
dirty I'm getting covered in blood I

1088
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:13,710
still there's still game mechanics every

1089
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:15,180
step of the way even when you're just

1090
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:17,580
riding to and back from the place same

1091
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:18,780
with Grand Theft Auto when you're

1092
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,070
driving in those games you're still

1093
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:21,450
driving even if you're driving to a

1094
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:23,100
place and back then you get to the place

1095
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,330
and then there's a bunch of stuff to do

1096
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:26,460
maybe you're sneaking into a house and

1097
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:27,750
murdering somebody in their sleep so

1098
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:29,460
maybe you're climbing a bell tower and

1099
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,100
you're sniping people maybe you're

1100
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,970
winging it you're maybe you're setting a

1101
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:34,740
fire to a thing and then you're going to

1102
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:36,360
burn down the place and shoot people as

1103
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,800
they come out of the burning fire or or

1104
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,210
maybe you're gonna rob a train or it's

1105
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:41,670
just Lenti of game mechanics but okay

1106
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:44,700
it's also an interactive movie and so I

1107
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:47,420
think and it's certainly not say Detroit

1108
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:50,460
become human or any of those other style

1109
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:52,980
of interactive movies is not that but

1110
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,300
there's still plenty of interactive

1111
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,870
movie in there I think it's closer to

1112
00:38:56,870 --> 00:39:01,080
breath of the wild then I than it is to

1113
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,540
a walking simulator because you're still

1114
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:04,830
cooking and you're still eating and

1115
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:06,000
there's still food and there's still

1116
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,590
crafts and there's still whatever so I

1117
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:08,820
think comparing it to a walking

1118
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:11,130
simulator is probably not correct but

1119
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:14,220
there's smoke yeah there's still plenty

1120
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:17,370
of cutscenes and plenty of movies it's

1121
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:19,230
not as bad as a metal gear solid game or

1122
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:21,750
the upcoming Kingdom Hearts game did I

1123
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:24,470
say my new earth made a III Jacob right

1124
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:27,780
Ellis ray Ellis was um I played the

1125
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:29,370
Kingdom Hearts demo and they gave me one

1126
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:30,570
hour to play the Kingdom Hearts demo

1127
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:32,190
nice end an hour that's normally like 30

1128
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:33,510
minutes for an MMO and it goes yeah

1129
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:39,270
there's a 25-minute cutscene 25 minutes

1130
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:41,310
I'm like what in the demo you brought to

1131
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:44,040
e3 demo and I'm like is that in the main

1132
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,240
game it's like oh yes in the main

1133
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,860
gainers lockups is in the main game and

1134
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:49,170
with 2020 and maybe it's 20 minutes but

1135
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:51,680
it was like a 20 25 minute cutscene

1136
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,920
after

1137
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,180
cut snow because that was the thing

1138
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,710
that's why I played to Kingdom Hearts

1139
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:57,720
games as the cutscenes they're good they

1140
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,640
are good watch movie I want to watch

1141
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,980
this movie man you know I like me never

1142
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:04,020
set down my controller and eat and make

1143
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:07,800
an entire sandwich and and then go poop

1144
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,840
it out during a cutscene that's that's

1145
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,900
fine by me you know so it's just one of

1146
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:15,090
those games where the the story line did

1147
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:16,980
you see donkeys review hi donkey I don't

1148
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:19,050
know he's not gonna watch I did I hate

1149
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:20,850
it I think his review is pretty accurate

1150
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:22,620
it really does start off really strong

1151
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:26,370
you're not only 1012 hours in and so

1152
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:27,870
it's still very very strong for me I

1153
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:30,090
love the characters I love the side

1154
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:30,480
quests

1155
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,480
I love the development I love Rockstar

1156
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,570
creates some characters you won't see

1157
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:38,490
anywhere else just that's true nobody's

1158
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:41,490
really bold who's got the balls to put

1159
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:43,830
the clan in your video game only

1160
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:47,370
Rockstar only Rockstar will make us

1161
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:49,860
suffer just killable in their game and

1162
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:51,210
they're gonna do it that's what they do

1163
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:52,650
I said something on Twitter this week

1164
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:53,730
that got me a lot of trouble and I'm

1165
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:54,930
curious what you guys think about this

1166
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:57,300
opinion rockstar is quoted as saying

1167
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:00,150
that we like to controversy sells games

1168
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:04,290
right and so I I personally think they

1169
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:05,670
know what they're doing when they put

1170
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:07,710
like controversial characters in in

1171
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:09,540
their games like that I think I think

1172
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:11,730
obviously you know you go back to the

1173
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:13,500
torture scene in Grand Theft Auto 5 did

1174
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,320
you guys play GTA 5 yeah yeah that's one

1175
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,720
of the only torture scenes in a video

1176
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,560
game that ever made me feel

1177
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,590
uncomfortable like straight up

1178
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:24,360
completely like set down the controller

1179
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,610
trying to figure out how to skip this

1180
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:28,260
torture scene kind of uncomfortable

1181
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:30,510
there's one of the witcher 3 that got me

1182
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:31,050
pretty good

1183
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:32,910
Oh which one minor spoilers to The

1184
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:36,150
Witcher 3 here so it got me so good

1185
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:38,340
because basically you're breaking into a

1186
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:39,810
prison or something like that and you

1187
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:41,730
have your friend Tris with you and she's

1188
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:44,730
kind of acting as a decoy and it's not

1189
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:47,760
even on screen you can just hear them

1190
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,460
torturing her in the other room right

1191
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:53,640
the longer you as a player can deal with

1192
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:54,330
that

1193
00:41:54,330 --> 00:41:57,060
the better the I don't know quest goes

1194
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,800
for you the less guys you have to fight

1195
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,990
the like that's what you're supposed to

1196
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:04,200
do and there's not any gameplay reason

1197
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,690
why you can't just

1198
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,250
in you to let him torture her while you

1199
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:09,410
keep pumping that guy for information

1200
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:11,420
which is what you're there for but man

1201
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:13,430
after that second shriek I couldn't

1202
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:15,230
handle it anymore and I just had to pull

1203
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:16,460
myself out and kill everybody

1204
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:19,790
yep I think I love gaming that hidden

1205
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:22,550
from me visually was so brilliant yep

1206
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:24,500
III know a lot of people like to condemn

1207
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,030
stuff like that and video games but I

1208
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:28,160
think that's what makes gaming so great

1209
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,050
I feel like you can easily do that in

1210
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:31,580
the movie we've done it in hundreds of

1211
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:33,320
movies just this year you know okay I

1212
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,520
think you can easily do that in the book

1213
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,630
and you can easily do that and even a

1214
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:37,670
television show so I don't see a reason

1215
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:39,440
that we can't do that in video games as

1216
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,760
long as we're rating it fairly I

1217
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,500
celebrate that customer and I think

1218
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:43,910
we're talking about two of the most edgy

1219
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:45,560
companies on the planet we're talking

1220
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,990
about the folks at Rossini Projekt RED

1221
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:49,340
who again I have some friends on that

1222
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:50,900
team so I should be careful when I talk

1223
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:51,980
about that to always remind you guys

1224
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:53,630
that you know I get to see the cyberpunk

1225
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:55,730
demo and and I got a statue back there

1226
00:42:55,730 --> 00:42:57,230
at least sent me collector's edition

1227
00:42:57,230 --> 00:42:58,910
version of the game but they'd love to

1228
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:00,680
push the edge and so when we set through

1229
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:01,430
the cyberpunk

1230
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:04,520
demo which you can now watch the same

1231
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,590
gameplay we saw on YouTube but they were

1232
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:08,270
like so we want to let you know that we

1233
00:43:08,270 --> 00:43:10,940
have made the decision to make this a

1234
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:13,490
very adult rated game that there's going

1235
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:15,020
to be a lot of sexual content that

1236
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:15,890
there's going to be a lot of violence

1237
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:17,960
and we're not going to back off and I

1238
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,820
think that's I think that's cool you

1239
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:21,050
know as long as you're putting that on

1240
00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:23,330
the box as long as people oh no I think

1241
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:24,860
that's great and when you buy a rockstar

1242
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:25,970
game you need to know what you're

1243
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:27,920
getting into right we all know what

1244
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,260
we're getting into a except gameplay and

1245
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:31,850
I think it is a fair criticism that a

1246
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:33,260
lot of people are going to give Red Dead

1247
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:34,760
Redemption to its game of the year I

1248
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:37,730
might still how much of that do you

1249
00:43:37,730 --> 00:43:40,190
think is just recency bias oh that's

1250
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:41,270
always going to be part of it too right

1251
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:42,530
we always forget about the games that

1252
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:43,700
come out at the beginning of the year

1253
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:44,960
and what did come out of the begin this

1254
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,550
your monster hunter world for Christ 5

1255
00:43:46,550 --> 00:43:48,470
God of War see that's the thing I think

1256
00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:49,940
god of war is gonna be the game of the

1257
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:52,220
year for a lot of people and that came

1258
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:53,150
out right at the beginning of the year

1259
00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:54,890
what a weird time to release that game

1260
00:43:54,890 --> 00:43:56,480
I'm so surprised but again if you look

1261
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,700
at the the stacked lineup for February

1262
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:01,880
of this next year my god there's so many

1263
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:04,120
games that got delayed to February of

1264
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,360
2019

1265
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:09,110
we now have a second broke Tober we now

1266
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:11,720
have a second month in which we have to

1267
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:14,780
buy 12 video games as youtubers and

1268
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:16,160
review every single one of them which is

1269
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,420
going to be great you know because

1270
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:18,530
normally January and February is a

1271
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:19,400
really boring

1272
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,200
for gaming channels but it's not gonna

1273
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,400
be this time things are gonna have

1274
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:23,839
plenty of stuff to play as plenty of

1275
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:25,670
stuff to do everybody was trying to

1276
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:27,020
avoid the shadow of Red Dead Redemption

1277
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:29,359
and called yeah right and and that's why

1278
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:31,220
I'm so eager and I hope you listeners

1279
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:32,569
out there buy plenty of games in

1280
00:44:32,569 --> 00:44:33,829
February this year because if we can

1281
00:44:33,829 --> 00:44:36,619
split up that workload you know we get

1282
00:44:36,619 --> 00:44:38,299
to buy a lot of games we get that we get

1283
00:44:38,299 --> 00:44:38,750
the Hangout

1284
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:40,609
of course it does stink as a budget game

1285
00:44:40,609 --> 00:44:42,619
as you guys know I'm I do well for

1286
00:44:42,619 --> 00:44:44,420
myself now but I still think like a

1287
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:46,880
budget gamer all the time so I still

1288
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,049
know and I'm always trying to keep

1289
00:44:48,049 --> 00:44:49,670
budget gamers in mind because you guys

1290
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:51,079
are still budget gamers right like you

1291
00:44:51,079 --> 00:44:52,160
guys are doing well for yourselves too

1292
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,869
but at the same time you watch what you

1293
00:44:53,869 --> 00:44:56,450
spend we all do and so I know it's gonna

1294
00:44:56,450 --> 00:44:58,640
suck that a you know bunch of games come

1295
00:44:58,640 --> 00:44:59,869
out in February but a lot of people used

1296
00:44:59,869 --> 00:45:01,579
to just wait till February to buy the

1297
00:45:01,579 --> 00:45:03,829
game that came out in October I don't

1298
00:45:03,829 --> 00:45:07,190
have rice right you know so I but now

1299
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:09,160
there's gonna be a brand new hot game

1300
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:11,980
Bethesda listen to me

1301
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:16,490
delay fallout to February please finish

1302
00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:20,650
that game please please do that for us

1303
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:23,329
no they're not gonna you know maybe if

1304
00:45:23,329 --> 00:45:25,010
if more people had gotten to test it

1305
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:27,619
before now maybe if rather than do it a

1306
00:45:27,619 --> 00:45:29,119
full release now they were like okay now

1307
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:31,730
it's in open beta and then it will get

1308
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:33,020
released then maybe that would be

1309
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:34,520
something that they could work with but

1310
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:36,619
it's probably too late it isn't it is

1311
00:45:36,619 --> 00:45:39,500
inherently a flawed concept Bethesda has

1312
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:40,579
always been a comedy that says you know

1313
00:45:40,579 --> 00:45:42,380
we really smoggy games and that's okay

1314
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:44,059
and it's always fun I'm like a Skyrim

1315
00:45:44,059 --> 00:45:45,980
and fallout it's fine little buggy

1316
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:47,690
that's fine and we can fix it we can

1317
00:45:47,690 --> 00:45:49,730
mind it right you know I mean to some

1318
00:45:49,730 --> 00:45:51,890
extent you know and it's never been game

1319
00:45:51,890 --> 00:45:59,990
breaking you know that's true but you

1320
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:02,839
can't you can't do that with a

1321
00:46:02,839 --> 00:46:05,630
multiplayer game no especially one with

1322
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:07,309
cosmetic microtransactions you

1323
00:46:07,309 --> 00:46:10,369
especially a68 our title here we began

1324
00:46:10,369 --> 00:46:12,920
apparently I can yes well if you look at

1325
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:14,539
the YouTube reviews and if you look at

1326
00:46:14,539 --> 00:46:15,980
the beta impressions I think a lot of

1327
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:17,930
people are pretty mad at that game I'm

1328
00:46:17,930 --> 00:46:19,039
still gonna play it I'm gonna give it a

1329
00:46:19,039 --> 00:46:20,299
fair chance because that's what I do I'm

1330
00:46:20,299 --> 00:46:22,460
a reviewer I review games I'm gonna dive

1331
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:24,230
into it and I'm gonna see how bad it is

1332
00:46:24,230 --> 00:46:25,760
and I'm going to criticize the hell out

1333
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,650
of it somebody said as shit

1334
00:46:27,650 --> 00:46:29,599
the somebody said of something really

1335
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:31,970
interesting and it was a journalist

1336
00:46:31,970 --> 00:46:33,140
nonetheless

1337
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:34,460
sets up me on Twitter to the other day

1338
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:36,140
but I was complaining about Diablo

1339
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:37,369
immortal and my concerns about

1340
00:46:37,369 --> 00:46:38,839
monetization he says if you don't like

1341
00:46:38,839 --> 00:46:41,359
it don't play it and shut up and I I

1342
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:44,630
like I was sassy I I got sassy on

1343
00:46:44,630 --> 00:46:48,170
Twitter because it's 2018 I say I quote

1344
00:46:48,170 --> 00:46:49,579
rate tweeted and I'm like hey I'm a

1345
00:46:49,579 --> 00:46:52,309
gaming commentator so you shouldn't be

1346
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:55,670
surprised when I supply comments about a

1347
00:46:55,670 --> 00:46:58,069
game buddy like I don't know

1348
00:46:58,069 --> 00:47:00,380
that's mean buggy that's as mean as I

1349
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:03,049
get on Twitter but that in the block

1350
00:47:03,049 --> 00:47:06,260
button but but it's so surprising like

1351
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:07,970
people don't want you to criticize that

1352
00:47:07,970 --> 00:47:09,019
game people don't want to criticize

1353
00:47:09,019 --> 00:47:11,930
anything and I don't I don't understand

1354
00:47:11,930 --> 00:47:14,539
that I it's it's bizarre because you're

1355
00:47:14,539 --> 00:47:17,569
criticizing me for criticizing it so I

1356
00:47:17,569 --> 00:47:19,099
don't that's business you don't like

1357
00:47:19,099 --> 00:47:21,200
criticism citizen don't criticize but I

1358
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,150
don't know I think you should make an

1359
00:47:23,150 --> 00:47:24,980
informed decision you should have an

1360
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:26,809
actual opinion that you've you know come

1361
00:47:26,809 --> 00:47:27,740
up with based on what you've seen

1362
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:30,019
because a lot of the times when things

1363
00:47:30,019 --> 00:47:33,049
like this will happen both negatively

1364
00:47:33,049 --> 00:47:34,579
with Diablo and mortal people will jump

1365
00:47:34,579 --> 00:47:35,930
on the bandwagon and oh yeah it's gonna

1366
00:47:35,930 --> 00:47:37,160
be the worst game ever I can't believe

1367
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:39,200
it blizzards dead to me and that might

1368
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,089
be the case but those people are only

1369
00:47:41,089 --> 00:47:42,289
saying that because that's the

1370
00:47:42,289 --> 00:47:45,440
prevailing mood on rhetoric or the other

1371
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,680
way back with BioShock Infinite

1372
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:50,210
everybody jumped on that games I'm not

1373
00:47:50,210 --> 00:47:51,980
gonna say that everybody really liked

1374
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:54,140
that game so much it was terrible

1375
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:55,849
I loved it for this one my favorite game

1376
00:47:55,849 --> 00:47:57,650
really not really all I couldn't stand

1377
00:47:57,650 --> 00:47:59,750
it I was so disappointed that's that's

1378
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:01,009
the first time I remember getting

1379
00:48:01,009 --> 00:48:04,309
totally sucked into over height and but

1380
00:48:04,309 --> 00:48:06,799
I I do think I do think the spider-man

1381
00:48:06,799 --> 00:48:09,289
um discussion that had happened this

1382
00:48:09,289 --> 00:48:11,119
year so we've been both shot at before

1383
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:11,960
if you guys don't know where the phrase

1384
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:13,880
bullshitting means it's when people take

1385
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:16,190
screenshots of a game or show video of a

1386
00:48:16,190 --> 00:48:18,440
game in its early stages as pre-release

1387
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:19,789
stages that are better than the release

1388
00:48:19,789 --> 00:48:21,019
version and then the release version

1389
00:48:21,019 --> 00:48:22,309
doesn't look as good and we've seen that

1390
00:48:22,309 --> 00:48:23,720
so many times so people are very

1391
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:24,650
concerned about that

1392
00:48:24,650 --> 00:48:27,140
and so it takes is one cry of bull

1393
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:28,789
shotting and people are gonna lose their

1394
00:48:28,789 --> 00:48:30,740
minds right and so we saw that with

1395
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:35,269
spider-man right and and of course I

1396
00:48:35,269 --> 00:48:36,799
made fun of that with like Francis I

1397
00:48:36,799 --> 00:48:39,109
think I did a video siding with them

1398
00:48:39,109 --> 00:48:41,119
puddle gate and then dismantling puddle

1399
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:44,079
gate cuz it's funny to me but that said

1400
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:46,460
the game actually got improved like if

1401
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:47,330
you look at the 10

1402
00:48:47,330 --> 00:48:49,040
series on the the suit they're better

1403
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:50,750
they don't look as plastically either

1404
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:52,070
there are plenty of puddles that just

1405
00:48:52,070 --> 00:48:53,360
weren't puddles in that one room and the

1406
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:54,710
reason we're opposed in the room is the

1407
00:48:54,710 --> 00:48:56,840
developer said it didn't make sense

1408
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:59,000
because the the the reflection of those

1409
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,440
puddles of writing wasn't an accurate

1410
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:01,970
reflection we didn't wanted to get rid

1411
00:49:01,970 --> 00:49:03,440
of the immersiveness it wasn't graphical

1412
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,850
downgrade it was an artistic choice and

1413
00:49:04,850 --> 00:49:06,140
all this other stuff but it didn't

1414
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:08,720
matter people grab the grab it oh it's

1415
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,670
the game has been downgraded it looks

1416
00:49:10,670 --> 00:49:11,960
worse since ever been it's the worst

1417
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:13,790
game ever this is polish shotting people

1418
00:49:13,790 --> 00:49:17,000
are easy to miss information is super

1419
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,280
easy to spread in 2018 you know and it's

1420
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,780
just gonna get worse as we more people

1421
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:22,700
get connected and that's it that's okay

1422
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:24,920
that's okay because I always encourage

1423
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:27,560
my viewers and I think I think that's

1424
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:29,390
something I get praised for and accused

1425
00:49:29,390 --> 00:49:31,040
of a lot but I always encourage my

1426
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:33,050
viewers anything you've listened to here

1427
00:49:33,050 --> 00:49:35,090
today in this podcast don't take it as

1428
00:49:35,090 --> 00:49:37,760
written do your own research why watch

1429
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,740
somebody play a game before you make an

1430
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:41,690
opinion about a game watch some gameplay

1431
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:43,370
not just official gameplay but finding

1432
00:49:43,370 --> 00:49:45,680
youtuber find a twitch streamer find a

1433
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,630
voice he tries if you do preorder a game

1434
00:49:47,630 --> 00:49:48,800
before you go pick up your pre-order

1435
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,530
because it's refundable watch somebody

1436
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:52,880
else play the game right and make sure

1437
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,920
you understand make sure you get it and

1438
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:58,130
and you'll find even if it's somebody

1439
00:49:58,130 --> 00:50:00,110
you trust if you trust me I know a lot

1440
00:50:00,110 --> 00:50:01,700
of people trust me I make mistakes I've

1441
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:03,590
made two or three things that I've had

1442
00:50:03,590 --> 00:50:05,780
to take back reported as news in my

1443
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:07,280
gaming news series this year and to two

1444
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:10,070
or three things that I've had to correct

1445
00:50:10,070 --> 00:50:11,990
or or even walk back entirely because

1446
00:50:11,990 --> 00:50:13,430
they weren't entirely accurate because I

1447
00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:15,740
do as much research research as I can

1448
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:18,050
but sometimes it's it's not possible

1449
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:21,110
right now so you should always critical

1450
00:50:21,110 --> 00:50:23,840
thinking is so important especially now

1451
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:25,580
where we're being provided so many

1452
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:26,990
different opposing point of views right

1453
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:29,960
and and so I don't know we should do

1454
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,310
that with gaming it and I think it's

1455
00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:33,740
fair I think it's fair to be upset about

1456
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:35,990
Diablo coming to mobile and I think it's

1457
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:39,500
fair when the reporter this is my gaming

1458
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:41,570
news segment last week that the

1459
00:50:41,570 --> 00:50:43,940
developers at at Blizzard have said

1460
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:46,490
we've moved some of our best developers

1461
00:50:46,490 --> 00:50:48,620
on to mobile exclusive games so we plan

1462
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:51,010
to bring most of our IPS to mobile I

1463
00:50:51,010 --> 00:50:53,510
would play Warcraft tower defense game

1464
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:55,280
on mobile by the way just because that

1465
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:59,210
would be fun but that said

1466
00:50:59,210 --> 00:51:01,710
yeah I think it's okay to not like the

1467
00:51:01,710 --> 00:51:03,000
direction mobile games are taken I think

1468
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,050
it's okay to voice your opinion about

1469
00:51:04,050 --> 00:51:05,070
that I think it's okay to voice your

1470
00:51:05,070 --> 00:51:08,100
opinion that but you should still if if

1471
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:10,290
Diablo turns out to be a fairly

1472
00:51:10,290 --> 00:51:11,640
monetized game and it turns out to be a

1473
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:13,380
good game I think that's okay I think

1474
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:15,030
it's okay and you should still give it a

1475
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:15,600
fair chance

1476
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:18,240
I think but people love to meme right

1477
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:23,160
people like the groom think right now

1478
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:25,590
and I think that's okay any and if so

1479
00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:27,140
besides the the hype machine for

1480
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:29,040
BioShock Infinite what about you Jake

1481
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:31,650
have you ever you ever felt like you

1482
00:51:31,650 --> 00:51:33,120
went along with a crowd and then the

1483
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:33,900
crowd was wrong

1484
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:35,550
anytime you got too hyped or underhyped

1485
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:37,920
or oh yeah I totally got burned by sea

1486
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:38,430
of Thieves

1487
00:51:38,430 --> 00:51:41,550
I saw him coming out it was a rare game

1488
00:51:41,550 --> 00:51:44,250
it looks like a blast I wanted to be a

1489
00:51:44,250 --> 00:51:46,530
pirate I bought into the hype and I day

1490
00:51:46,530 --> 00:51:49,620
one spent $60 I bought the game and I

1491
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:52,320
played it for 10-15 hours and then I was

1492
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:54,030
out of things to do and I got bored and

1493
00:51:54,030 --> 00:51:55,530
I stopped playing it yeah I'm not gonna

1494
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:57,030
say that I didn't have fun doing the

1495
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:58,230
things that were there there just

1496
00:51:58,230 --> 00:52:00,300
weren't enough things there to do right

1497
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:02,580
I saw a lot of no man skies comparisons

1498
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:06,330
there but I think a very different man

1499
00:52:06,330 --> 00:52:09,810
oh man sky that team continues to work

1500
00:52:09,810 --> 00:52:11,490
on that game they're still patching and

1501
00:52:11,490 --> 00:52:13,200
they're still adding content if so I'd

1502
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,390
hand off I'm hoping at the end of year 1

1503
00:52:15,390 --> 00:52:17,340
maybe there'll be a nice big patch and

1504
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:18,630
I'll go back and look at and say wow

1505
00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:21,150
this is completed every game they've

1506
00:52:21,150 --> 00:52:23,100
added so much stuff to it but they've

1507
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:24,990
added quite a bit of things but not a

1508
00:52:24,990 --> 00:52:27,090
lot certainly not as much as no man's

1509
00:52:27,090 --> 00:52:30,750
sky oh oh no which guy is a very good

1510
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:32,550
game now I realize now it's not great

1511
00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:34,590
it's not great it's but it's good

1512
00:52:34,590 --> 00:52:36,600
probably close to very good I was very

1513
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:38,900
surprised it's still not my kind of game

1514
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:41,460
when they the new latest patch hit and

1515
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:43,080
everybody went back to the game and it

1516
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:44,400
got all the free press for you know

1517
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,230
fixing the game and stuff I went back to

1518
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:47,670
them like well does I see where this is

1519
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:50,370
really fun for some people yes not fun

1520
00:52:50,370 --> 00:52:52,530
for me it's really grindy you know yeah

1521
00:52:52,530 --> 00:52:54,900
yeah I could I could never get into a

1522
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:56,250
lot of those games like rust and that's

1523
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:58,380
probably why I'm so down on fallout 76

1524
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:01,920
to fallout 76 to me is not a not by I if

1525
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:02,820
you guys don't know this by the way I

1526
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:03,990
guess there's a lot of new first-time

1527
00:53:03,990 --> 00:53:06,090
listeners I don't really rate the games

1528
00:53:06,090 --> 00:53:08,100
like I know one to ten or scale or

1529
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:08,730
anything like that

1530
00:53:08,730 --> 00:53:12,120
I say I say by day one I say by

1531
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:13,019
eventually

1532
00:53:13,019 --> 00:53:15,449
I say you know wait to buy until

1533
00:53:15,449 --> 00:53:17,249
something provokes you and then there's

1534
00:53:17,249 --> 00:53:21,419
no body and I the 76 is not I don't buy

1535
00:53:21,419 --> 00:53:24,269
to me it is a it's a wait-and-see it's a

1536
00:53:24,269 --> 00:53:26,159
you know wait for discount wait for

1537
00:53:26,159 --> 00:53:29,789
patches wait for it to get polished wait

1538
00:53:29,789 --> 00:53:31,319
and see what people have to say about it

1539
00:53:31,319 --> 00:53:32,999
but it's it's not it

1540
00:53:32,999 --> 00:53:35,009
don't buy a status like if you decide

1541
00:53:35,009 --> 00:53:37,109
you want to play the game on day one I'm

1542
00:53:37,109 --> 00:53:38,789
not gonna judge it you know just be

1543
00:53:38,789 --> 00:53:40,499
prepared for a buggy experience you know

1544
00:53:40,499 --> 00:53:43,049
do you think that the rise or the

1545
00:53:43,049 --> 00:53:45,299
acceptance of early access has led to

1546
00:53:45,299 --> 00:53:48,089
games getting sort of pushed out before

1547
00:53:48,089 --> 00:53:49,709
they're ready they don't call in early

1548
00:53:49,709 --> 00:53:51,179
access anymore and that's frustrating no

1549
00:53:51,179 --> 00:53:54,149
I I was against early access from the

1550
00:53:54,149 --> 00:53:56,339
very beginning because I I bought some

1551
00:53:56,339 --> 00:53:59,009
games that never got finished war of the

1552
00:53:59,009 --> 00:54:02,069
overworld a war for the overworld the

1553
00:54:02,069 --> 00:54:05,399
next car game some other I bought some

1554
00:54:05,399 --> 00:54:08,369
games that never got finished but more

1555
00:54:08,369 --> 00:54:09,749
importantly I think most of us will get

1556
00:54:09,749 --> 00:54:11,640
tired of a game within 20 or 30 hours so

1557
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:14,669
we play the the early access version of

1558
00:54:14,669 --> 00:54:16,019
the game and it's not very good and then

1559
00:54:16,019 --> 00:54:17,759
we hate the game and we never buy the

1560
00:54:17,759 --> 00:54:19,919
play the finished version get the planet

1561
00:54:19,919 --> 00:54:21,119
a finished version instead if you're one

1562
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:22,259
of those players I've always encouraged

1563
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:24,899
that that said now we're saying main

1564
00:54:24,899 --> 00:54:26,609
game Kyle you know I like Triple A

1565
00:54:26,609 --> 00:54:28,380
companies do that with triple-a titles

1566
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:31,019
like fallout 76 I think that's very

1567
00:54:31,019 --> 00:54:32,639
disturbing I think it's a very it's

1568
00:54:32,639 --> 00:54:34,529
frustrating thing these felt like an

1569
00:54:34,529 --> 00:54:36,089
early access beta test right but

1570
00:54:36,089 --> 00:54:37,859
consumers it wasn't enough there right

1571
00:54:37,859 --> 00:54:39,659
consumers will continue to buy and what

1572
00:54:39,659 --> 00:54:41,249
sort of the most weirdest weird weird

1573
00:54:41,249 --> 00:54:42,329
things so I don't know if you guys heard

1574
00:54:42,329 --> 00:54:44,519
this but call of duty black ops for

1575
00:54:44,519 --> 00:54:46,799
didn't either replay that yeah not my

1576
00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:49,019
kind of game surprisingly good not my

1577
00:54:49,019 --> 00:54:50,699
kind of game either and I was really

1578
00:54:50,699 --> 00:54:52,169
upset that they removed single-player

1579
00:54:52,169 --> 00:54:52,949
because that's the only thing I ever

1580
00:54:52,949 --> 00:54:55,319
enjoyed about call of duty games but I

1581
00:54:55,319 --> 00:54:57,419
really enjoy blackout mode I played it

1582
00:54:57,419 --> 00:54:58,559
during the beta and I played a little

1583
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:01,889
bit at 5 hours if that but play mature

1584
00:55:01,889 --> 00:55:03,809
beta and played a little bit of the the

1585
00:55:03,809 --> 00:55:06,059
you know release version and was very

1586
00:55:06,059 --> 00:55:07,619
surprised but then they added their

1587
00:55:07,619 --> 00:55:09,599
microtransactions the microtransactions

1588
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:12,529
are insane and so they made some

1589
00:55:12,529 --> 00:55:15,269
ridiculous amount of money in the first

1590
00:55:15,269 --> 00:55:18,059
week our first month I forget but you

1591
00:55:18,059 --> 00:55:20,009
can google the articles right now I'm

1592
00:55:20,009 --> 00:55:21,539
going to give a number this is not an

1593
00:55:21,539 --> 00:55:23,729
accurate number it's like 500 million

1594
00:55:23,729 --> 00:55:25,169
dollars in the first two weeks or

1595
00:55:25,169 --> 00:55:25,900
something like that

1596
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:27,940
and they are saying it still wasn't

1597
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:29,230
enough because then they added

1598
00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:32,520
microtransactions right after and so

1599
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:35,500
Activision which owns Blizzard by the

1600
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:37,420
way which is one of the reasons we're so

1601
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:39,309
worried about Diablo immortal for those

1602
00:55:39,309 --> 00:55:41,410
of you don't make that connection yeah

1603
00:55:41,410 --> 00:55:45,609
um well it seems like they're insatiable

1604
00:55:45,609 --> 00:55:48,010
it seems like there isn't no amount of

1605
00:55:48,010 --> 00:55:49,869
money that they can earn that will make

1606
00:55:49,869 --> 00:55:51,400
them say alright that was enough you

1607
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,680
know there there isn't there are company

1608
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:55,630
there specifically designed to make

1609
00:55:55,630 --> 00:55:57,549
money and they do that by exploiting a

1610
00:55:57,549 --> 00:55:59,829
consumer so Waterman is not just them

1611
00:55:59,829 --> 00:56:01,720
being greedy and I mean I guess at all

1612
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:03,460
it all boils down to greed eventually

1613
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:06,789
but Activision has so many IPs under its

1614
00:56:06,789 --> 00:56:08,859
purview that the way that a company like

1615
00:56:08,859 --> 00:56:11,680
that functions is these 10 over here

1616
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:13,839
failed because they they weren't very

1617
00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:15,910
good or they didn't have anything behind

1618
00:56:15,910 --> 00:56:18,130
them so Blizzard has to pick up that

1619
00:56:18,130 --> 00:56:20,170
slack so we're just gonna release this

1620
00:56:20,170 --> 00:56:22,599
shovel we're way has lizard money always

1621
00:56:22,599 --> 00:56:24,520
comes and then I'm not saying that's the

1622
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:27,369
case here but that's a big driving force

1623
00:56:27,369 --> 00:56:29,349
for how this kind of stuff happens when

1624
00:56:29,349 --> 00:56:31,869
you have these massive companies making

1625
00:56:31,869 --> 00:56:33,940
these games and that's what that's what

1626
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:35,619
makes me scratch my head is is that

1627
00:56:35,619 --> 00:56:37,660
Bethesda is a massive company so why

1628
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:39,490
don't they want to put all of the spit

1629
00:56:39,490 --> 00:56:41,170
and polish on fallout 76 is humanly

1630
00:56:41,170 --> 00:56:43,869
possible why stick to this date maybe it

1631
00:56:43,869 --> 00:56:44,890
has something to do with the release

1632
00:56:44,890 --> 00:56:46,059
scheduled for next year maybe it's

1633
00:56:46,059 --> 00:56:47,740
because fallout 4 is only two years away

1634
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:49,299
or fallout 5 is two years away or

1635
00:56:49,299 --> 00:56:51,190
something like that maybe autoscrolls us

1636
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:52,630
closer they don't wanna compete with it

1637
00:56:52,630 --> 00:56:54,789
maybe I don't know but it's so weird

1638
00:56:54,789 --> 00:56:56,380
that you've got companies on one hand

1639
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:58,119
that want to put up the best version of

1640
00:56:58,119 --> 00:56:59,470
a game that they can and maximize

1641
00:56:59,470 --> 00:57:01,329
hundreds of millions and dollars of

1642
00:57:01,329 --> 00:57:03,400
profit and the fallout 76 which seems

1643
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:04,480
like it's getting rushed out the door

1644
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:06,670
and certainly will not be a successful

1645
00:57:06,670 --> 00:57:08,619
because of that and it feels like it's

1646
00:57:08,619 --> 00:57:09,910
being a release in early access how do

1647
00:57:09,910 --> 00:57:11,890
they justify that how do they how do

1648
00:57:11,890 --> 00:57:12,880
they decide to do that and I think

1649
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:14,319
you're right to some extent I think I

1650
00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:15,640
just shovel about it doesn't matter we

1651
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:17,520
got some core games coming it'll be fine

1652
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,510
especially when it's a franchise game

1653
00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:21,819
and they know it will sell all right so

1654
00:57:21,819 --> 00:57:23,740
you know that people will buy that name

1655
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:27,220
right it's so weird that Diablo which is

1656
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:28,990
such a history franchise the game I've

1657
00:57:28,990 --> 00:57:31,180
been playing for 15 years 16 years

1658
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:33,339
something like that it's so weird that

1659
00:57:33,339 --> 00:57:34,750
they would say I don't know shovelware

1660
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:36,250
one let's just let's just shove it out

1661
00:57:36,250 --> 00:57:37,779
there I just put the name on it and sure

1662
00:57:37,779 --> 00:57:39,190
it'll damage the brain

1663
00:57:39,190 --> 00:57:41,770
brand irrevocably but hey we'll make

1664
00:57:41,770 --> 00:57:44,440
some money and and and that seems like

1665
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:45,970
an Activision decision more than it

1666
00:57:45,970 --> 00:57:47,589
seems like a blizzard decision you know

1667
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:49,900
I'm sure but like the people that you

1668
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:51,369
know we grew up with on blizzard games

1669
00:57:51,369 --> 00:57:53,890
aren't there anymore which is a real

1670
00:57:53,890 --> 00:57:55,990
shame you know it is but I understand

1671
00:57:55,990 --> 00:57:57,579
that you know those guys are done they

1672
00:57:57,579 --> 00:58:00,490
made games for 20 years and now they're

1673
00:58:00,490 --> 00:58:02,800
out of games well I'm for a changing of

1674
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:04,030
the guard at this changing of the

1675
00:58:04,030 --> 00:58:05,800
gardens not been a positive experience

1676
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,780
from a player's standpoint I will say

1677
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:09,040
and this problem one of my favorite

1678
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:10,390
things to come out of the entire Diablo

1679
00:58:10,390 --> 00:58:12,970
controversy there's a game called path

1680
00:58:12,970 --> 00:58:14,859
of Exile and it was developed by X

1681
00:58:14,859 --> 00:58:17,380
Blizzard developers who worked on the

1682
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:19,420
Diablo franchise and they went on to

1683
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:21,490
make the Diablo game of their dreams and

1684
00:58:21,490 --> 00:58:24,609
oh my god is it good with the gem system

1685
00:58:24,609 --> 00:58:26,980
and leveling up your gems and the skill

1686
00:58:26,980 --> 00:58:28,690
tree looks like the Final Fantasy 10

1687
00:58:28,690 --> 00:58:31,270
skill tree and it's insanely huge and

1688
00:58:31,270 --> 00:58:33,400
you know like 80 levels and like you can

1689
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:34,960
rebuild your character so many different

1690
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:36,730
ways to do so much different stuff and

1691
00:58:36,730 --> 00:58:37,869
everybody can use everything and it's

1692
00:58:37,869 --> 00:58:40,300
the storyline is okay but then there's

1693
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:42,220
like the new delve system where you know

1694
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:43,990
each season you're trying to hit the

1695
00:58:43,990 --> 00:58:45,849
lowest level of delving you can its wow

1696
00:58:45,849 --> 00:58:48,640
it's a such a good game free to play and

1697
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,920
the microtransactions are all cosmetic

1698
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:54,280
so I don't know why you wouldn't

1699
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:57,220
download that game right now um if

1700
00:58:57,220 --> 00:58:58,690
you're interested in new diablo style

1701
00:58:58,690 --> 00:59:00,700
game because the habla 4 is coming we

1702
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:02,200
know it's coming and it's probably going

1703
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:05,200
to be very good and i can't wait but if

1704
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,510
the team is only starting working on it

1705
00:59:07,510 --> 00:59:09,280
now they're not ready to show footage of

1706
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:12,190
it now and they weren't at e3 all right

1707
00:59:12,190 --> 00:59:14,589
I'm sorry Bliss con yeah then it's

1708
00:59:14,589 --> 00:59:16,420
probably two maybe three years out you

1709
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:18,550
can play a lot of path of Exile the next

1710
00:59:18,550 --> 00:59:20,380
two or three years so while we're

1711
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:22,930
talking about Diablo can i you're

1712
00:59:22,930 --> 00:59:23,980
playing the switch version right yeah

1713
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:26,410
the switch version of Diablo is a very

1714
00:59:26,410 --> 00:59:28,359
good version of that game I'm not gonna

1715
00:59:28,359 --> 00:59:31,270
say it like adds anything grand or new

1716
00:59:31,270 --> 00:59:34,060
other than it took the Diablo 3 that I

1717
00:59:34,060 --> 00:59:36,550
love to play and now I can lay in bed

1718
00:59:36,550 --> 00:59:38,470
and play it and then when I have to go

1719
00:59:38,470 --> 00:59:39,940
to the bathroom I can get up and sit on

1720
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:41,349
the toilet and play it and then go back

1721
00:59:41,349 --> 00:59:43,180
to my bed and continue playing nice is

1722
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:45,369
it is it fully functioning is it like I

1723
00:59:45,369 --> 00:59:46,960
mean like the season the seasonal

1724
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:48,579
characters and all the stuff that that's

1725
00:59:48,579 --> 00:59:50,560
available it has all of the stuff that

1726
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:53,269
the other console versions have

1727
00:59:53,269 --> 00:59:55,249
the only main difference between the PC

1728
00:59:55,249 --> 00:59:56,689
version and the console version that I

1729
00:59:56,689 --> 01:00:00,109
am aware of is they added a dodge roll

1730
01:00:00,109 --> 01:00:01,999
button you can flick the right stick in

1731
01:00:01,999 --> 01:00:04,640
a direction to dodge that way it kind of

1732
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:06,589
makes up for your little bit of lack of

1733
01:00:06,589 --> 01:00:10,400
control the left joystick to like point

1734
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:12,949
your guy in a directional autotargets

1735
01:00:12,949 --> 01:00:15,650
your abilities but now you can dodge

1736
01:00:15,650 --> 01:00:17,809
roll I don't that's a pretty big deal I

1737
01:00:17,809 --> 01:00:20,179
have a question how does that game jive

1738
01:00:20,179 --> 01:00:22,549
with because I mean is mobile your on

1739
01:00:22,549 --> 01:00:25,429
your switch if you are the guy in the

1740
01:00:25,429 --> 01:00:26,900
switch commercials who likes to play his

1741
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:29,299
video games on the train to work you

1742
01:00:29,299 --> 01:00:30,859
don't have an internet connection how

1743
01:00:30,859 --> 01:00:32,779
does a game like Diablo which as far as

1744
01:00:32,779 --> 01:00:34,579
I know needs a constant internet

1745
01:00:34,579 --> 01:00:37,159
connection work if you try and play it

1746
01:00:37,159 --> 01:00:39,739
offline it doesn't I mean it completely

1747
01:00:39,739 --> 01:00:41,569
works it doesn't require the internet at

1748
01:00:41,569 --> 01:00:43,699
any point in time I can disconnect from

1749
01:00:43,699 --> 01:00:45,529
the from the Blizzard servers and it

1750
01:00:45,529 --> 01:00:46,969
tells you it's like hey your disconnect

1751
01:00:46,969 --> 01:00:48,109
from Blizzard servers you can't see

1752
01:00:48,109 --> 01:00:49,640
leaderboards can't see anything like

1753
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:50,029
that

1754
01:00:50,029 --> 01:00:53,029
but you the game still functions but I

1755
01:00:53,029 --> 01:00:54,349
haven't laid the elbow three in a while

1756
01:00:54,349 --> 01:00:55,999
but I think Diablo 3 did have an offline

1757
01:00:55,999 --> 01:00:58,759
version as well right I think you i but

1758
01:00:58,759 --> 01:01:01,130
i thought leah did not initially it was

1759
01:01:01,130 --> 01:01:02,900
a big complaint for a lot of people

1760
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:04,459
right right yep that's true I do

1761
01:01:04,459 --> 01:01:06,650
remember that oh man how long has seven

1762
01:01:06,650 --> 01:01:08,589
years since I gave him out or five years

1763
01:01:08,589 --> 01:01:11,239
four or five years it's changed a lot

1764
01:01:11,239 --> 01:01:12,799
since then for sure so the console

1765
01:01:12,799 --> 01:01:13,880
version is pretty good right I've never

1766
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:15,499
played a console version so the console

1767
01:01:15,499 --> 01:01:18,979
it's quite good and I'm a big fan of the

1768
01:01:18,979 --> 01:01:20,839
switch version because I can lay in bed

1769
01:01:20,839 --> 01:01:22,789
in and you can also play as gainin as a

1770
01:01:22,789 --> 01:01:24,829
barbarian like a Gannon skin there's

1771
01:01:24,829 --> 01:01:27,499
there is a gaming skin there is amiibo

1772
01:01:27,499 --> 01:01:29,509
functionality if you're in today oh my

1773
01:01:29,509 --> 01:01:32,349
god what's a good I am what does it do

1774
01:01:32,349 --> 01:01:34,489
the I don't know what the armor does I

1775
01:01:34,489 --> 01:01:36,169
don't have the armor I hadn't done it

1776
01:01:36,169 --> 01:01:38,029
yet there's also a loot goblin amiibo

1777
01:01:38,029 --> 01:01:41,179
then you can tap to just make a loot

1778
01:01:41,179 --> 01:01:45,559
goblin appear oh yes please you two you

1779
01:01:45,559 --> 01:01:47,059
have all the amiibos right Jacob

1780
01:01:47,059 --> 01:01:49,640
or most of the amiibos I have most of

1781
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:52,759
the smash amiibos and the most and in

1782
01:01:52,759 --> 01:01:55,369
the the splatoon amiibos I have them all

1783
01:01:55,369 --> 01:01:57,079
the only ones they don't have they're

1784
01:01:57,079 --> 01:01:59,809
Monster Hunter stories ones yeah I'm

1785
01:01:59,809 --> 01:02:01,009
gonna bring up this little little Goblin

1786
01:02:01,009 --> 01:02:02,599
I did not know this existed until you it

1787
01:02:02,599 --> 01:02:05,689
is a is a Game Stop exclusive but it's

1788
01:02:05,689 --> 01:02:06,470
very a

1789
01:02:06,470 --> 01:02:08,900
horrible and cute and also it makes a

1790
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:11,450
lute goblin appear that's very good it's

1791
01:02:11,450 --> 01:02:13,220
that's a good functionality when yeah

1792
01:02:13,220 --> 01:02:16,190
when you can you just use like once a

1793
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:17,810
day is there functionality for all other

1794
01:02:17,810 --> 01:02:20,510
amiibos as well i have not checked i

1795
01:02:20,510 --> 01:02:22,940
think that it probably is just the lute

1796
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:24,770
goblin amiibo and and then the Ganon

1797
01:02:24,770 --> 01:02:26,990
amiibo I think that's how you get the

1798
01:02:26,990 --> 01:02:28,040
armor I'm not hundred percent sure on

1799
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:30,200
that one okay I've got my almost got a

1800
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:31,880
screen shot I don't ring it up he's so

1801
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:37,970
cute I'm so bad oh I kind of they

1802
01:02:37,970 --> 01:02:39,530
stopped making very many amiibos

1803
01:02:39,530 --> 01:02:41,900
recently so I kind of feel like I mean

1804
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:43,250
they were mostly cranking them out for

1805
01:02:43,250 --> 01:02:45,530
smash now we're about to get a lot more

1806
01:02:45,530 --> 01:02:47,390
waves with the new smash coming out

1807
01:02:47,390 --> 01:02:49,070
because they're going to make a figure

1808
01:02:49,070 --> 01:02:50,720
for all of the smash characters that

1809
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:52,730
don't already have a face all 6,000 of

1810
01:02:52,730 --> 01:02:54,680
them nice little loot goblin is now

1811
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:56,690
hanging out he's now this stream is now

1812
01:02:56,690 --> 01:02:58,720
apparently sponsored by that loot goblin

1813
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:02,119
visit the goblin Luke goblin realm and

1814
01:03:02,119 --> 01:03:04,160
pick up your loot today I guess but

1815
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:06,290
basically if you like Diablo 3 and

1816
01:03:06,290 --> 01:03:08,090
you're looking for another way to play

1817
01:03:08,090 --> 01:03:10,520
it very comfortably the switch version

1818
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:12,410
is fantastic I have not had a single

1819
01:03:12,410 --> 01:03:13,970
frame drop that I have noticed and I'm

1820
01:03:13,970 --> 01:03:16,040
playing a necromancer with maximum

1821
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:18,020
summons on and I go and fight a bunch of

1822
01:03:18,020 --> 01:03:20,480
bosses that make a bunch of ads and I've

1823
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:23,240
not lost a break yeah yeah when you were

1824
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:24,560
over last night I remember you were

1825
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:26,510
trying to get a lag so that's pretty

1826
01:03:26,510 --> 01:03:28,700
impressive I will say it murders your

1827
01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:31,130
battery oh yeah what you're playing

1828
01:03:31,130 --> 01:03:32,180
right now you're playing most of the

1829
01:03:32,180 --> 01:03:34,369
Diablo 3 playing anything else Jacob a

1830
01:03:34,369 --> 01:03:36,170
little bit of Destiny too and I'm a

1831
01:03:36,170 --> 01:03:37,520
little ashamed

1832
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:41,690
real sound ashamed you said so many

1833
01:03:41,690 --> 01:03:44,119
nasty dirty things about hey it's free

1834
01:03:44,119 --> 01:03:45,290
to play right now you know it's free to

1835
01:03:45,290 --> 01:03:47,630
download so well and I already was not

1836
01:03:47,630 --> 01:03:49,940
the most big I already bought the most

1837
01:03:49,940 --> 01:03:51,500
recent expansion when it came out and

1838
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:53,839
then they made it very very much more

1839
01:03:53,839 --> 01:03:57,650
affordable uh yeah so how is destiny has

1840
01:03:57,650 --> 01:03:59,750
it changed much since launch

1841
01:03:59,750 --> 01:04:01,970
yeah it's changed a bit I've been

1842
01:04:01,970 --> 01:04:03,830
dipping in and out so it's hard for me

1843
01:04:03,830 --> 01:04:05,330
to see a complete three line of every

1844
01:04:05,330 --> 01:04:07,160
change that they've made it's changed

1845
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:09,080
quite a bit from what I understand but

1846
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:10,970
it continues to be just a very good

1847
01:04:10,970 --> 01:04:13,010
shooting experience right all of the

1848
01:04:13,010 --> 01:04:15,770
guns just feel very good to shoot and

1849
01:04:15,770 --> 01:04:17,660
when you shoot a guy it reacts and it

1850
01:04:17,660 --> 01:04:20,000
feels good when I played Diablo

1851
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,640
all right what I played destiny I felt

1852
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:23,840
like there wasn't enough weird guns

1853
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:25,400
I wanted weird guns so they ever start

1854
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:28,910
adding weird guns uh no not really

1855
01:04:28,910 --> 01:04:31,910
there are there are a few that will like

1856
01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:33,530
drastically change how they fire and

1857
01:04:33,530 --> 01:04:34,730
stuff like that but for the most part

1858
01:04:34,730 --> 01:04:36,680
it's it's pretty much like shotguns

1859
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:39,170
rocket launchers rifles I wanted to be I

1860
01:04:39,170 --> 01:04:41,210
wanted to be like Borderlands you know

1861
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:42,830
style I wanted to like shoot a gun that

1862
01:04:42,830 --> 01:04:44,270
shoots smaller guns you know I want

1863
01:04:44,270 --> 01:04:46,100
weird you want weird guns you should

1864
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:47,180
check out more friend

1865
01:04:47,180 --> 01:04:50,720
I've heard of good war things I want to

1866
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,130
say hundreds of different guns that's

1867
01:04:52,130 --> 01:04:53,960
probably an exaggeration but they

1868
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:56,330
definitely help seem absolutely bizarre

1869
01:04:56,330 --> 01:04:58,760
guns and racket and then with those want

1870
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:00,110
to tell you is free-to-play monetize but

1871
01:05:00,110 --> 01:05:03,710
I've heard it's mostly cosmetic mostly

1872
01:05:03,710 --> 01:05:06,140
cosmetic it is one of the more fair

1873
01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:07,730
microtransaction games that I've ever

1874
01:05:07,730 --> 01:05:09,020
seen right

1875
01:05:09,020 --> 01:05:11,810
particularly since every day you get to

1876
01:05:11,810 --> 01:05:14,150
like open a box and that box does not

1877
01:05:14,150 --> 01:05:16,370
necessarily contain loot often it will

1878
01:05:16,370 --> 01:05:18,470
contain a discount on like premium

1879
01:05:18,470 --> 01:05:20,390
currency alright I do want to retract

1880
01:05:20,390 --> 01:05:23,930
you like 75% off your next purchase so

1881
01:05:23,930 --> 01:05:25,850
that means that you can get $100 worth

1882
01:05:25,850 --> 01:05:28,940
of platinum for 25 bucks that's that's I

1883
01:05:28,940 --> 01:05:31,100
like that I should I should go back to

1884
01:05:31,100 --> 01:05:32,570
say path exile also shells

1885
01:05:32,570 --> 01:05:34,490
loot tabs I forgot to mention that

1886
01:05:34,490 --> 01:05:36,110
earlier you know please forgive me I'm

1887
01:05:36,110 --> 01:05:37,400
sure there's a comment starting the

1888
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:38,870
comment section below that I screwed

1889
01:05:38,870 --> 01:05:40,190
that up but you were right I did screw

1890
01:05:40,190 --> 01:05:41,780
that up

1891
01:05:41,780 --> 01:05:43,070
so what are you playing right now Jacob

1892
01:05:43,070 --> 01:05:45,200
alright Ellis cheese I'm gonna do that

1893
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:49,450
forever I'm so bad at playing right now

1894
01:05:49,450 --> 01:05:51,860
Jacob number two one of you Jacob

1895
01:05:51,860 --> 01:06:00,650
Ellis I want to be taking Prime yep all

1896
01:06:00,650 --> 01:06:02,270
right you've been usurped as the the

1897
01:06:02,270 --> 01:06:04,040
primary Jacob Jacob Prime

1898
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:05,990
what are you playing right now so like

1899
01:06:05,990 --> 01:06:07,820
you said I'm playing a lot of magic

1900
01:06:07,820 --> 01:06:10,040
arena that's been taking up most of my

1901
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:10,340
time

1902
01:06:10,340 --> 01:06:12,590
a few mobile games here and there I just

1903
01:06:12,590 --> 01:06:15,230
started epic 7 which is just exactly

1904
01:06:15,230 --> 01:06:19,250
another mono transaction filled gotcha

1905
01:06:19,250 --> 01:06:21,580
game like I've played a million times

1906
01:06:21,580 --> 01:06:24,740
I've been looking for some kind of

1907
01:06:24,740 --> 01:06:27,470
colony sim or indie game to like catch

1908
01:06:27,470 --> 01:06:29,120
my interest recently I haven't even

1909
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:31,130
played in the oxygen not included by

1910
01:06:31,130 --> 01:06:33,200
clay studios not heard of it haven't

1911
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:33,500
played

1912
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:36,920
good I really like it it's probably not

1913
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:38,180
your kind of game I don't think it's

1914
01:06:38,180 --> 01:06:40,790
it's your sort of gameplay loop but if

1915
01:06:40,790 --> 01:06:42,830
you enjoy engineering or like fiddling

1916
01:06:42,830 --> 01:06:44,150
around with a bunch of systems it's a

1917
01:06:44,150 --> 01:06:46,820
blast and clay does excellent art on all

1918
01:06:46,820 --> 01:06:48,620
of their games which is why I usually

1919
01:06:48,620 --> 01:06:50,390
end up buying all of them they're the

1920
01:06:50,390 --> 01:06:51,710
folks behind darkest dungeon

1921
01:06:51,710 --> 01:06:55,820
oh yeah very good game yeah I have to

1922
01:06:55,820 --> 01:06:58,370
look at it um sim six by the way coming

1923
01:06:58,370 --> 01:07:00,020
to the switch is that weird that's kind

1924
01:07:00,020 --> 01:07:02,060
of weird would you play this sieve six

1925
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:04,160
would you play civilization on a switch

1926
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:05,510
I've never actually played a

1927
01:07:05,510 --> 01:07:07,250
civilization game I played some

1928
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:10,520
stellaris which is a space sieve

1929
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:14,630
basically um that game does so much that

1930
01:07:14,630 --> 01:07:16,580
I can't really imagine needing another

1931
01:07:16,580 --> 01:07:18,950
version of it you know the only reason I

1932
01:07:18,950 --> 01:07:20,990
didn't buy Diablo on the day I came out

1933
01:07:20,990 --> 01:07:23,110
on the switch with the holy reason um

1934
01:07:23,110 --> 01:07:25,460
because smash is coming out and then

1935
01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:27,170
Pokemon is coming out so well I have my

1936
01:07:27,170 --> 01:07:28,430
switch in my hand I'm not gonna be

1937
01:07:28,430 --> 01:07:30,140
playing Diablo man I'm hopefully play in

1938
01:07:30,140 --> 01:07:32,870
Pokemon which can we talk about a little

1939
01:07:32,870 --> 01:07:33,800
bit about the Pokemon game so we're

1940
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:35,570
talking about this house last night so a

1941
01:07:35,570 --> 01:07:36,920
lot of people are riding off this

1942
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:39,730
Pokemon game and I think to some extent

1943
01:07:39,730 --> 01:07:42,560
rightfully so because it is not a core

1944
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:44,990
game I think it's a mistake

1945
01:07:44,990 --> 01:07:48,950
yep that said I did we saw it at e3 and

1946
01:07:48,950 --> 01:07:51,290
my impression of e3 the e3 Tim I didn't

1947
01:07:51,290 --> 01:07:53,060
play it but we saw it I looked at

1948
01:07:53,060 --> 01:07:54,440
somebody playing I was like wow man that

1949
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:56,030
does not look like a para maana game I'm

1950
01:07:56,030 --> 01:07:58,520
done it is fair if you were waiting for

1951
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:00,200
a core entry game I think it's fair to

1952
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:03,230
wait that said I started playing Pokemon

1953
01:08:03,230 --> 01:08:04,940
go again recently the last community day

1954
01:08:04,940 --> 01:08:07,190
was yesterday I got a shiny Typhlosion

1955
01:08:07,190 --> 01:08:10,250
and he's like hi IV like 67% IVs

1956
01:08:10,250 --> 01:08:11,450
incredible I'm so excited

1957
01:08:11,450 --> 01:08:13,190
Pokemon go is still really fun you guys

1958
01:08:13,190 --> 01:08:14,360
should check that game out again if

1959
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:15,800
you're listening but okay and the

1960
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:17,930
community is really cool that said this

1961
01:08:17,930 --> 01:08:19,700
incorporates some of the stuff from

1962
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:21,890
Pokemon go like the berries like the

1963
01:08:21,890 --> 01:08:23,359
leveling system but like somebody's

1964
01:08:23,359 --> 01:08:25,009
complaining you tivity was complaining

1965
01:08:25,009 --> 01:08:26,799
about the leveling system that your your

1966
01:08:26,799 --> 01:08:29,060
Pokemon level up even if they didn't

1967
01:08:29,060 --> 01:08:30,859
fight that's been true for the last

1968
01:08:30,859 --> 01:08:32,450
three generations have you never heard

1969
01:08:32,450 --> 01:08:34,640
of XP share like it's of course I'm used

1970
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:36,230
to that right I've got a I've got a

1971
01:08:36,230 --> 01:08:40,609
level 45 in in ultra Sun and Moon I've

1972
01:08:40,609 --> 01:08:43,339
got a level 45 Snorlax who I've never

1973
01:08:43,339 --> 01:08:45,859
brought to battle these is laze Betty's

1974
01:08:45,859 --> 01:08:47,150
in the back row sleep

1975
01:08:47,150 --> 01:08:48,830
and leveling up that's fine I don't have

1976
01:08:48,830 --> 01:08:50,120
a problem that oh I don't like feeding

1977
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:52,460
berries to Pokemon I'm feeding pokey

1978
01:08:52,460 --> 01:08:54,319
beans in ultrasone and known to my

1979
01:08:54,319 --> 01:08:56,239
Pokemon I'm a man are you playing core

1980
01:08:56,239 --> 01:08:57,830
games if you don't like these mechanics

1981
01:08:57,830 --> 01:08:59,600
I don't want to I don't want to brush my

1982
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:01,219
Pokemon well then you've now been

1983
01:09:01,219 --> 01:09:02,389
playing a core game because it's very

1984
01:09:02,389 --> 01:09:04,190
important to brush and clean your

1985
01:09:04,190 --> 01:09:07,159
Pokemon to make them like you and yeah

1986
01:09:07,159 --> 01:09:08,239
so I don't know what to tell these

1987
01:09:08,239 --> 01:09:08,779
people

1988
01:09:08,779 --> 01:09:10,670
but that said I get that the catch

1989
01:09:10,670 --> 01:09:12,469
system isn't as fun walking up to a

1990
01:09:12,469 --> 01:09:14,089
legendary and just throwing balls at

1991
01:09:14,089 --> 01:09:16,100
it's going to be kind of dumb I get that

1992
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:19,190
I get it the trainer battles are just

1993
01:09:19,190 --> 01:09:21,409
the same looking identical they look

1994
01:09:21,409 --> 01:09:22,549
identical as far as I can tell that

1995
01:09:22,549 --> 01:09:24,440
might not be accurate but they look

1996
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:26,270
identical in it noodle battles are more

1997
01:09:26,270 --> 01:09:27,770
fun than wild battles and that's all

1998
01:09:27,770 --> 01:09:30,529
this game it and it retells the story of

1999
01:09:30,529 --> 01:09:33,290
red versus blue for so a lot of us who

2000
01:09:33,290 --> 01:09:35,120
skip that because you know we weren't

2001
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:37,659
born yet or we were broke at the time

2002
01:09:37,659 --> 01:09:41,330
like me it's a chance to see the red and

2003
01:09:41,330 --> 01:09:43,339
blue storyline you know what's that

2004
01:09:43,339 --> 01:09:45,440
what's the original region called I

2005
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:47,210
forget Oh can't say writes it's the

2006
01:09:47,210 --> 01:09:49,339
Kanto storyline and so you get to hang

2007
01:09:49,339 --> 01:09:51,319
out Professor Oak and you get to get

2008
01:09:51,319 --> 01:09:54,679
Kabutops or the helix fossile or are you

2009
01:09:54,679 --> 01:09:55,610
gonna do all that cool shit

2010
01:09:55,610 --> 01:09:57,230
Aerodactyl is in that game to your right

2011
01:09:57,230 --> 01:09:59,570
if I remember mm-hmm yeah but he's like

2012
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:01,340
it's how do you get a battle I don't

2013
01:10:01,340 --> 01:10:03,380
know I never play through the original I

2014
01:10:03,380 --> 01:10:06,380
can do p.m. you if you want I heard

2015
01:10:06,380 --> 01:10:07,940
there's one under a truck if you know

2016
01:10:07,940 --> 01:10:10,460
how to do that right right and then or

2017
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:12,590
whatever they'll include on the arrow

2018
01:10:12,590 --> 01:10:14,810
Pokemon what was the error token II know

2019
01:10:14,810 --> 01:10:16,969
I know fucking no in there that'd be

2020
01:10:16,969 --> 01:10:17,360
cool

2021
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:22,730
it would be a fun nod but that's that's

2022
01:10:22,730 --> 01:10:24,739
a sad thing to me that like we don't get

2023
01:10:24,739 --> 01:10:28,100
those kinds of bugs in games anymore but

2024
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:29,929
at least not nearly as frequently right

2025
01:10:29,929 --> 01:10:31,310
oh you said it's just Red Dead

2026
01:10:31,310 --> 01:10:32,360
Redemption where somebody walks through

2027
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:33,739
a wall which happened to be on stream

2028
01:10:33,739 --> 01:10:35,030
the other day or like guy was floating

2029
01:10:35,030 --> 01:10:36,440
above the thing he's setting on why is

2030
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:38,929
it I don't want to go back to Pokemon I

2031
01:10:38,929 --> 01:10:41,120
want to go back to Pokemon but why is it

2032
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:43,429
when we hate on a game we will point

2033
01:10:43,429 --> 01:10:44,989
those bugs out and make compilation

2034
01:10:44,989 --> 01:10:46,610
videos of those bugs but I don't see

2035
01:10:46,610 --> 01:10:47,570
very many Red Dead Redemption

2036
01:10:47,570 --> 01:10:50,719
compilation videos about the bugs I've

2037
01:10:50,719 --> 01:10:52,100
seen in red and I've seen plenty I've

2038
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:53,389
seen a lot of characters walking through

2039
01:10:53,389 --> 01:10:54,440
walls you see a lot of characters like

2040
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:56,510
walking through the mud I've seen you

2041
01:10:56,510 --> 01:10:58,340
know walking you know floating above the

2042
01:10:58,340 --> 01:10:59,650
thing they're sitting on

2043
01:10:59,650 --> 01:11:01,270
I don't know why people don't point that

2044
01:11:01,270 --> 01:11:02,830
out still I think we still should Red

2045
01:11:02,830 --> 01:11:04,780
Dead Redemption is a great game it's got

2046
01:11:04,780 --> 01:11:06,280
bugs in it and that's okay and it's not

2047
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:08,560
the core feature like say Mass Effect

2048
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:09,940
the latest Mass Effect which is just

2049
01:11:09,940 --> 01:11:12,909
horrible and but I don't know it's it's

2050
01:11:12,909 --> 01:11:14,650
so weird to see those games unfairly

2051
01:11:14,650 --> 01:11:16,420
critiqued and then Red Dead Redemption

2052
01:11:16,420 --> 01:11:18,369
not being fairly critiqued it should be

2053
01:11:18,369 --> 01:11:20,560
fairly critiqued we should I want to I

2054
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:22,989
want to read that Google this right now

2055
01:11:22,989 --> 01:11:24,730
if you're listening at home I'll google

2056
01:11:24,730 --> 01:11:26,139
it too as soon as I'm done streaming I

2057
01:11:26,139 --> 01:11:27,909
want to see some bug compilations Red

2058
01:11:27,909 --> 01:11:29,469
Dead Redemption - and not just a funny

2059
01:11:29,469 --> 01:11:31,510
moments compilation I want to see one

2060
01:11:31,510 --> 01:11:35,020
that tears that game apart sure peace I

2061
01:11:35,020 --> 01:11:36,369
think that's the problem is that a lot

2062
01:11:36,369 --> 01:11:37,869
of the bugs that happen in games like

2063
01:11:37,869 --> 01:11:40,330
Red Dead are amusing right they're funny

2064
01:11:40,330 --> 01:11:42,190
right and it's only a problem when

2065
01:11:42,190 --> 01:11:43,750
they're game breaking when eight stops

2066
01:11:43,750 --> 01:11:46,570
my progression alright I will say my

2067
01:11:46,570 --> 01:11:47,860
favorite thing of red that I've done so

2068
01:11:47,860 --> 01:11:50,739
far is whenever you're riding along they

2069
01:11:50,739 --> 01:11:52,810
try to throw a lot of like stuff at you

2070
01:11:52,810 --> 01:11:54,790
and so there was like some guy caught in

2071
01:11:54,790 --> 01:11:56,679
a bear trap here or maybe some guy who's

2072
01:11:56,679 --> 01:11:58,449
fishing or some guy who's a prospector

2073
01:11:58,449 --> 01:12:00,190
some guy is whatever some guy lost in

2074
01:12:00,190 --> 01:12:01,480
the woods some guys some guy some guys

2075
01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:03,219
some guys sometimes whatever a girl

2076
01:12:03,219 --> 01:12:04,780
whose horse died in the road now she is

2077
01:12:04,780 --> 01:12:06,310
right back stuff like that just hundreds

2078
01:12:06,310 --> 01:12:07,810
a little encounters like that hundreds

2079
01:12:07,810 --> 01:12:10,510
of a huge variety of counters one of the

2080
01:12:10,510 --> 01:12:12,460
encounters I had where I played it the

2081
01:12:12,460 --> 01:12:13,840
other night and I actually recorded this

2082
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:15,460
on my xbox and played on the Xbox one X

2083
01:12:15,460 --> 01:12:17,770
by the way cuz that's the 4k version its

2084
01:12:17,770 --> 01:12:19,750
native 4k it's so it looks so good on

2085
01:12:19,750 --> 01:12:23,070
the Xbox one X anyway I came across a

2086
01:12:23,070 --> 01:12:26,050
meeting of hooded characters who I will

2087
01:12:26,050 --> 01:12:27,489
not even say the name of a due to the

2088
01:12:27,489 --> 01:12:32,290
algorithm and I'm like oh my god I can't

2089
01:12:32,290 --> 01:12:35,349
believe they put this in the game so I

2090
01:12:35,349 --> 01:12:37,239
lit a stick of dynamite and threw in the

2091
01:12:37,239 --> 01:12:39,820
middle of the middle of it and then they

2092
01:12:39,820 --> 01:12:42,580
all exploded and then the main character

2093
01:12:42,580 --> 01:12:44,920
as I go to loot their bodies and steal

2094
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:46,659
their horses to sell them to the folks

2095
01:12:46,659 --> 01:12:50,080
over in the main town

2096
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:57,639
he says you game I love being able to

2097
01:12:57,639 --> 01:12:59,290
blow up hooded characters that made me

2098
01:12:59,290 --> 01:13:02,409
very very happy that said you guys plan

2099
01:13:02,409 --> 01:13:03,820
to pick up the new Pokemon game on

2100
01:13:03,820 --> 01:13:04,989
switch is that the plan absolutely

2101
01:13:04,989 --> 01:13:06,909
probably will be yeah right right I'm

2102
01:13:06,909 --> 01:13:08,650
fine with it not being a core entry

2103
01:13:08,650 --> 01:13:11,739
series because controversial opinion I

2104
01:13:11,739 --> 01:13:13,390
get bored of core entry games

2105
01:13:13,390 --> 01:13:15,790
after I don't know maybe just beating

2106
01:13:15,790 --> 01:13:17,560
the main storyline I'm excited for

2107
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:18,940
something new different I don't know if

2108
01:13:18,940 --> 01:13:20,530
it'll be good or not but I definitely

2109
01:13:20,530 --> 01:13:21,280
want to give it a shot

2110
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:22,930
I wanted to refresh my memory so I'm

2111
01:13:22,930 --> 01:13:25,600
playing ultra moon again right now I'm

2112
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:29,230
like the seventh trial I think okay just

2113
01:13:29,230 --> 01:13:33,310
did the observatory trial and so I I I'm

2114
01:13:33,310 --> 01:13:34,690
trying to I want to make sure that I'd

2115
01:13:34,690 --> 01:13:36,220
be able to make a full one-on-one

2116
01:13:36,220 --> 01:13:38,140
comparison to the game everything I've

2117
01:13:38,140 --> 01:13:39,610
seen leading up to this game I still

2118
01:13:39,610 --> 01:13:40,840
think it's fair is I think it's gonna

2119
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:43,810
land at about a 75 on on Metacritic I

2120
01:13:43,810 --> 01:13:45,730
think users scores gonna be much lower

2121
01:13:45,730 --> 01:13:46,870
than that because a lot of people love

2122
01:13:46,870 --> 01:13:49,180
to hate on this game - Utley think it's

2123
01:13:49,180 --> 01:13:50,350
worth picking up and then I guess the

2124
01:13:50,350 --> 01:13:51,580
biggest game left to come out this year

2125
01:13:51,580 --> 01:13:54,010
I'm probably skipping battlefield 5 as a

2126
01:13:54,010 --> 01:13:56,560
consumer but I will play it you know

2127
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:57,910
they'll probably similar review code so

2128
01:13:57,910 --> 01:14:00,940
I'll probably downloaded I will dabble

2129
01:14:00,940 --> 01:14:02,770
fallout 76 Smash Brothers we're all

2130
01:14:02,770 --> 01:14:07,030
excited about smash write about smash so

2131
01:14:07,030 --> 01:14:10,390
can we talk about waluigi ii why is

2132
01:14:10,390 --> 01:14:18,070
lieutenant their method ways that's it

2133
01:14:18,070 --> 01:14:19,720
yeah cuz i'll they want to soak they

2134
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:21,460
want they know we want to so bad they're

2135
01:14:21,460 --> 01:14:23,890
just like you know what no right okay so

2136
01:14:23,890 --> 01:14:25,240
here's the thing for those you know I've

2137
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:26,950
been following waluigi is one of the

2138
01:14:26,950 --> 01:14:29,110
only characters not ever to be in a

2139
01:14:29,110 --> 01:14:32,290
smash game Wario is in the game as

2140
01:14:32,290 --> 01:14:35,140
brother and waluigi is not so at the

2141
01:14:35,140 --> 01:14:36,580
beginning of this people started memeing

2142
01:14:36,580 --> 01:14:38,560
we want waluigi why's waluigi not one of

2143
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:41,020
the rosters characters and he's not a

2144
01:14:41,020 --> 01:14:43,330
main roster character and then in this

2145
01:14:43,330 --> 01:14:46,630
last Nintendo Direct they revealed that

2146
01:14:46,630 --> 01:14:48,970
piranha plant which is not even a

2147
01:14:48,970 --> 01:14:51,880
character it is an obstacle you don't

2148
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:54,040
want to play PT so much right like I

2149
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:56,530
can't what what is happening that they

2150
01:14:56,530 --> 01:15:00,370
put a plant as a character over wall

2151
01:15:00,370 --> 01:15:01,090
Luigi

2152
01:15:01,090 --> 01:15:03,280
now I'm fully onboard with this memeing

2153
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:05,470
I want waluigi in this game why is

2154
01:15:05,470 --> 01:15:08,860
waluigi not yeah i'm so butthurt about

2155
01:15:08,860 --> 01:15:10,750
it now like and they say they said all

2156
01:15:10,750 --> 01:15:12,760
the DLC characters are done so whether

2157
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:14,830
or not waluigi is one of them we don't

2158
01:15:14,830 --> 01:15:16,360
know all so that means there's day one

2159
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:18,910
dlc are day one on this dlc for the game

2160
01:15:18,910 --> 01:15:20,260
that's kind of frustrating I guess not

2161
01:15:20,260 --> 01:15:22,570
on disk or cartridge

2162
01:15:22,570 --> 01:15:24,160
or maybe maybe in the article I read

2163
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:25,900
maybe they were chosen but you know they

2164
01:15:25,900 --> 01:15:26,710
balanced those gay

2165
01:15:26,710 --> 01:15:28,570
even long after the game comes out so

2166
01:15:28,570 --> 01:15:29,860
they could send me working about what

2167
01:15:29,860 --> 01:15:32,230
when they did the direct they announced

2168
01:15:32,230 --> 01:15:33,790
they had five characters and they had

2169
01:15:33,790 --> 01:15:35,500
not been decided what they were they

2170
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:37,030
just working on that roster than

2171
01:15:37,030 --> 01:15:39,220
probably misread they later a couple

2172
01:15:39,220 --> 01:15:40,960
weeks later they did say okay we've

2173
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:43,060
decided who they are okay good alright

2174
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:44,650
well waluigi better be one of them

2175
01:15:44,650 --> 01:15:46,420
because at this point people are gonna

2176
01:15:46,420 --> 01:15:48,490
write it what do you think of this so

2177
01:15:48,490 --> 01:15:49,960
those who haven't watched a Nintendo two

2178
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:53,530
right there is a spirit mode it looks

2179
01:15:53,530 --> 01:15:54,940
like a lot of fun that's weird right

2180
01:15:54,940 --> 01:15:56,380
like there's a bunch of characters that

2181
01:15:56,380 --> 01:15:58,360
are represented in the game with spirits

2182
01:15:58,360 --> 01:15:59,950
this time and then you can like level up

2183
01:15:59,950 --> 01:16:01,420
the spirits there's a lot of grinding

2184
01:16:01,420 --> 01:16:04,480
stuff how are you if you're telling me I

2185
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:06,610
can be villager from Animal Crossing and

2186
01:16:06,610 --> 01:16:08,200
then equip revolver ocelot

2187
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:09,820
and then go fight a piranha plant I'm

2188
01:16:09,820 --> 01:16:11,980
way into that that's so much a different

2189
01:16:11,980 --> 01:16:17,280
game like what's doing video games oh

2190
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:21,310
yeah it's but I will say this last

2191
01:16:21,310 --> 01:16:23,260
intended right I started getting smash

2192
01:16:23,260 --> 01:16:24,610
brothers fatigue because when they were

2193
01:16:24,610 --> 01:16:26,230
going into the details of the like all

2194
01:16:26,230 --> 01:16:27,910
the different systems I was like man

2195
01:16:27,910 --> 01:16:29,470
this is too much details like let me

2196
01:16:29,470 --> 01:16:31,330
play the game I want to turn this I

2197
01:16:31,330 --> 01:16:32,680
started fast-forwarding through the

2198
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:34,510
spirits devil I don't need to see this

2199
01:16:34,510 --> 01:16:36,250
you just want to see the big broader

2200
01:16:36,250 --> 01:16:37,990
print reveal that I saw or heard about

2201
01:16:37,990 --> 01:16:40,390
oh my god it's really as playable

2202
01:16:40,390 --> 01:16:41,710
character what are you doing it could

2203
01:16:41,710 --> 01:16:43,690
have been like one of the named Piranha

2204
01:16:43,690 --> 01:16:45,460
Plants like the one with the cages or

2205
01:16:45,460 --> 01:16:47,230
something that could have been like well

2206
01:16:47,230 --> 01:16:48,820
it could have been any others Mario

2207
01:16:48,820 --> 01:16:55,240
character on a plant you may know what

2208
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:57,220
boogey I'm in a first day when I come

2209

2210
01:16:58,780 --> 01:17:02,890

2216
01:17:11,950 --> 01:17:12,760

01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:17,050
I know I do

2218
01:17:17,050 --> 01:17:18,190
here's the problem with being friends

2219
01:17:18,190 --> 01:17:21,060
with these guys they know items

2220
01:17:21,060 --> 01:17:24,100
flat-plane only except Flint who only

2221
01:17:24,100 --> 01:17:26,710
wants to play on that god-awful Zelda

2222
01:17:26,710 --> 01:17:29,890
level because he wants to met like stock

2223
01:17:29,890 --> 01:17:32,920
only so that I'm out 5 minutes in so I

2224
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:34,539
have to go like Rita

2225
01:17:34,539 --> 01:17:39,760
look okay it's it's because I can't play

2226
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:41,079
I'm not good at video games you guys

2227
01:17:41,079 --> 01:17:43,059

2228
01:17:43,059 --> 01:17:45,219
at them come watch me on Twitch also

2229
01:17:45,219 --> 01:17:46,809

2230
01:17:46,809 --> 01:17:48,280
watch big breakfast big underscore

2231
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:52,030
breakfast yeah yeah that said that said

2232
01:17:52,030 --> 01:17:53,649
you know what guys I'm gonna lie I think

2233
