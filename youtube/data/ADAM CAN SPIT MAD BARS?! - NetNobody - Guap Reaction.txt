4
00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:14,400
got something a little bit different

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,710
from the normal reaction that guys are

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,230
used to instead of watching a video

7
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,750
we're gonna listen to a net nobody's

8
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,099
guap this is a song he released not too

9
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:30,990
long ago and the I only heard it I think

10
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:32,790

this purse is amazing and then the

51
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,750

60
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,840
kind of the best of two worlds and it

61
