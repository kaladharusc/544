1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,310
you know those days when you're like crazy busy the entire day but you get

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:07,379
nothing done

3
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:10,379
I thought today was

4
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,859
test test test this is test

5
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:27,750
hey this is the control is my old microphone that is potentially broken

6
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:35,880
this is with the new microphone plug it plug out plug it in and then the plug is

7
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,880
out

8
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:46,680
this is my old 70d as in the one I used to use before i got this 70d the reason

9
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,920
why don't use this one anymore is written on it and white out what that

10
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,440
says the audio port is completely now on this new one

11
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,739
the audio port is completely and what that means no matter what microphone you

12
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:00,480
plug in it doesn't work

13
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,260
it only uses the onboard microphones which may sound fine now but the minute

14
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,830
there's wind or any noise or you're close to it or anything like that just

15
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:08,610
want to

16
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,729
this is the second time that has happened

17
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:15,180
I offered to trade them this one for a new one but they didn't want to take my

18
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,799
deal

19
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,799
see you guys later

20
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:26,549
this is why i bought a new one this is what the onboard microphone sounds like

21
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:34,259
this is one external microphone sounds like this versus this here's a better

22
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:35,220
demonstration

23
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,310
they've got some drinks playing tricks playing behind there

24
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:42,060
there's noise outside and if I'm standing all the way over here

25
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:47,549
you can still think about saying fairly clearly now watch what happens when I

26
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:49,440
use the internal microphone

27
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:53,100
the guy say that makes sense doesn't it feel better

28
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,100
this is a this is with the external market doesn't that sound better

29
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:03,720

30
