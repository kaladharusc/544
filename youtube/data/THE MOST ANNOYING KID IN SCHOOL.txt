1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:06,640
You got this. Red leather, yellow leather, red leather, yellow leather.

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:12,100
Ahhhhh!

3
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:15,120
Teacher: I'm okay with Global Warming. Who likes the winter really?

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,560
Jordan: Good morning class, or should I say... Hood morning!

5
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,320
Teacher: You're late Jordan take a seat.

6
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:34,280
Jordan: What's up, my name's Jordan Schwartz. I'm a Senior at Blanview High School and I'm the Class Clown.

7
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,940
Teacher: Jordan, I need you to sit like a normal person.

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:39,900
Jordan: It's not my fault it's the desks fault.

9
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:43,180
Jordan: Yeah, I've been pretty funny all 12 years of school,

10
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:49,140
but this is the last month of Senior year and on Friday, our class votes for Yearbook titles and

11
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:54,600
while most people are going for Best Hair or Best Couple or Best Kiss, I'm

12
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,080
definitely gunning for Funniest.

13
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:03,060
Michael: I mean.. I guess Jordan's funny. He's not like laugh-out-loud funny.

14
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:06,720
More like I acknowledge that you're trying to make a joke.

15
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,080
Stephanie: I have four classes with that dude.

16
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,659
He does that hood thing everyday, even in the afternoon. So a few months ago

17
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:15,420
I was like hey.. You realize it's 2:30 p.m.

18
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:21,880
right? and he was like &quot;that's f*cking hilarious&quot; and laughed for a minute straight and now..

19
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,160
He just does that.

20
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,760
Teacher: You can use geometry in some cool ways like playing-

21
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:34,880
Jordan: Good afternoon class, or should I say... hood afternoon!

22
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,240
Teacher: You're late.

23
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,820
Jordan: I'm pretty confident I'll win funniest but

24
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,120
people only vote based on what they remember. So I

25
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,300
really need to step up my game these next few days.

26
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:49,940
Teacher: Who can tell me where on the map the African country Djibouti is?

27
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:54,820
Jordan: Hey, speaking of maps. Why do paper maps always lose poker tournaments?

28
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,580
Because they always fold.

29
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:00,920
Keith: Yo, I don't think you came up with that joke. I've heard that before.

30
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,060
Jordan: Just don't- don't- don't ruin this for me

31
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:07,560
Jordan: To make sure I stand out I've been trying to perform

32
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,000
as much as possible.

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,020
Renting venues can become pretty expensive, but I think it's worth the investment.

34
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:19,720
Teacher: What? No, Jordan. You can't pay me for stage time. You know if you want to come in here and tell your jokes,

35
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:26,980
that's fine. But come in early, okay? Not four minutes late next time. I'm instituting the tardy policy, okay?

36
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:27,720
Jordan: I come in late

37
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:33,240
so there's a packed house and FYI, you need to do a better job of warming up the crowd. They've been stiff as f*ck this week.

38
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,120
Teacher: Jordan!

39
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:39,400
Rachael: Honestly, I kind of used to admire the guy. Used to, like, genuinely make me laugh. But it seems like lately

40
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,540
he's been trying really hard to force stuff out, and it's getting SO cringy.

41
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:46,260
Jordan: Whoah! Michael's hung.

42
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:49,260
Jordan: I'm trying to just draw a smiley face! It's a smiley face! Jordan!

43
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,260
Teacher: Jordan, no!

44
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,720
Jordan: Ew, gross! He grabbed Michael's penis!

45
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,540
Teacher: I guess I didn't grab anybody's penis. This is what I haven't when I tried to sleep with your mom's

46
00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:02,180
Jordan: This is what had happened when I tried to sleep with your moms.

47
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,760
Keith: Why are you doing this?

48
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:09,280
Jordan: I think my inspiration would have to be my dad. He used to be the class clown and now

49
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:17,540
he's the funniest guy in the office.

50
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,540
Bob: Hey, Rick. Um..

51
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,380
Bob: How do you make a Kleenex-

52
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,020
Rick: What did I tell you about leaning on my desk?

53
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:25,000
Bob: Oh, sorry. Um...

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,660
How do you make a Kleenex dance?

55
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:36,580
Put a little boogie in it.

56
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:45,080
Bob: Hey, hey Jan. How do you make a Kleenex dance?

57
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:49,060
Teacher: Back to our mains, we really don't need our lungs as much as people think-

58
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,100
Jordan: Hood afternoon.

59
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:54,120
Teacher: Jordan, you're late again. You better have a good excuse.

60
00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:01,300
Jordan: Oh, yeah. You know, I was late for class because I was perfecting my craft.

61
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:08,620
Teacher: Great, great. That's a warning. One more and that's detention. Okay, Mr. Cool? Rachael!

62
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,820
What's your excuse?

63
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,940
Rachael: I'm sorry. I was late for your class because.. Um..

64
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:18,720
Perfecting my overdone catchphrase!

65
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,800
Teacher: Alright, go sit down.

66
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,780
Jordan: Uh.. Wait, she doesn't get a warning too?

67
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,880
Rachael: Well. We don't get warnings when we have to sit through your overtold jokes.

68
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,700
Everyone: Oh!

69
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:34,260
Teacher: Alright, guys.

70
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,610
Jordan: What the hell was that?

71
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,160
Rachael Mathis slang the room?

72
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,900
Listen. I respect a good roast, but Rachael f*cking Mathis!?

73
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:47,640
She hasn't told a joke in her whole life and suddenly,

74
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:53,320
she's the king of the school? This better not affect my chances of winning funniest.

75
00:04:53,320 --> 00:05:07,040
I mean I'm sure it'll blow over in a couple days, but still.. Just annoying.

76
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:11,620
Rachael: Perfecting my.. Overdone catchphrase!

77
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:19,120
Jordan: It's a meme now!? Her joke wouldn't have even existed if I hadn't been setting it up for the past year! She ripped me off!

78
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:25,860
She stole my joke and how did she even get that footage anyway?

79
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:34,300
Wait, it was you guys? Are you serious? Why would you do that? I thought we were- Okay.

80
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:46,400
Great, you know what? Cool. Cool. No. No, I'm done. I'm done. Good luck. Good luck with your documentary. I'm out.

81
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,210
Intercom: Good morning Blanview High. It's Friday morning,

82
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:54,460
which means the votes are finally in for the Senior Yearbook titles. For Prettiest, we have Lindsey Copette.

83
00:05:54,460 --> 00:06:03,680
For Best Couple, we have Brent Gilmore and Bethany Sholts. For Best Smile, we have Grady Lipton. And for Funniest we have...

84
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:12,379
Rachael Mathis.

85
00:06:12,379 --> 00:06:19,460
Rachael: Honestly I could care less. Yeah, those words mean nothing to me. But I would have liked to win something like Best Teeth.

86
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:24,280
Background: Are you thinking of Best Smile? I don't think there's a Best Teeth category.

87
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:31,100
Rachael: Well, there should be. You can totally have great teeth even if you don't smile all the time. I've got pretty great teeth.

88
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,140
Teacher: You think this may be a circle, but it's actually a square. You got-

89
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,920
Jordan: You've all heard the..

90
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:40,100
overdone catchphrase. But have you heard the

91
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,500
Overdone overdone catchphrase?

92
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,740
Kieth: What does that even mean?

93
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,620
Jordan: Overdone like overcooked.

94
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:50,020
Rachael: You're not even cooking anything.

95
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:53,900
(Everyone yelling and screaming)

96
00:06:53,900 --> 00:07:00,560
(Fire alarm goes off while everyone screams)

97
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:07,580
Jordan: Sure I didn't win Funniest and I got expelled and arrested, and I'm not allowed to walk at Graduation

98
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,439
or graduate.

99
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:11,629
But do I regret any of it?

100
00:07:11,629 --> 00:07:14,060
Absolutely not.

101
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:17,060
Rachael Mathis can have the Yearbook

102
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:20,540
because I got the newspaper. See that?

103
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:25,620
Funny kid.

104
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:31,420
Funny kid. This may have been a long journey full of personal and

105
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,560
legal repercussions.

106
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,620
But if I've learned anything..

107
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:48,140
It's why be the Class Clown when you can be the City Clown. Because now everyone else is just JAILous.

108
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:52,600
Plus I found my audience.

109
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,590
(Voiceover) Hood afternoon!

110
00:07:53,590 --> 00:08:12,000
