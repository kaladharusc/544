1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:00,500
안녕하세요 (Hello!)

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,140
(Pause for dramatic effect)

3
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:02,760
Uh...

4
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,940
*In korean* My name is Mark... iplier.

5
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:10,140
How are you? I'm in Korea and I...did the most unoriginal thing

6
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:16,000
I could possibly think of while I was in Korea, and I got a bunch of Korean candy to try on camera because...

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,820
I'm unoriginal...(oh really)

8
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:17,840
Hi Mom!

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,840
Mom: We're not going to be on TV. On camera!

10
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:20,440
Mark: TV?

11
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,620
Mom: No camera.
Mark: How popular do you think I am? *VERY*

12
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,740
So if you couldn't tell, I'm at my family's house.

13
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,400
My halmeoni's house

14
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,960
*Mark attempts to say &quot;I'm at my grandma's house&quot; in Korean*
*Mom corrects Mark*

15
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,440
*Mark gets it right*

16
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,380
*abuses table* I'm at my grandma's house. As you can hear rustling beneath me

17
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:41,400
I have a bunch of Korean candies, down here, that I'm gonna be trying. And to help me

18
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,140
I'm gonna bring in various members of my family in here

19
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:49,960
Uh, to assist me with this because well, I can't even read half of these labels. So *stares into soul* I have no idea what's in them

20
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:55,640
Oh, hello. Come on. Yeah, come on in. So now the room is full of people all watching me

21
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:04,200
Not creepy at all. Usually I record in my room alone, but now got the room of uhh, seven people here watching me

22
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,620
*THWACK* (By donating a dollar you can stop table abuse today)

23
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:07,620
(whispers) Sorry

24
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,800
I can't break anything here usually-

25
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,760
Person: *Korean* Be quiet! Mark: Waahhh??

26
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:18,260
*repeats in Korean for Mark*
Mark:ChuUujnngyyehHH???

27
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:24,940
I can't break anything here. This is my grandma's house. If I break anything here, I will be thrown out into the street (again)

28
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:26,980
and I'll be devoured by wolves. (again)

29
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:28,960
This is Chong hap.. (pauses)

30
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,180
kya...(pauses again)

31
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:34,380
la (and again) mel.

32
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,340
Oh! *1st accomplishment in his life*

33
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,600
kya-la-mel

34
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,880
Caramel?

35
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,920
*intense guessing*

36
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,320
I'm getting a lot of nodding heads and no &quot;yes&quot;es

37
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:53,360
*crinkling*

38
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,660
*Littering*

39
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,560
Ｃａｎｄｙ

40
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:02,880
Umm... I can only assume that it's not any different than anything I've ever tried in America.

41
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,780
*sniff* They smell...

42
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,200
There is a smell.

43
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:13,260
I don't like that this says &quot;bio-peach&quot; because in America if something was &quot;bio-peach&quot; that suggests it's radioactive.

44
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,700
What does radioactive mean in Korean?

45
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,080
Mom: Radioactive.

46
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,220
*Laughs* Someone tell Imagine Dragons they don't have to translate their song. (They see this, they'll know)

47
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:24,380
I'll go with that one, it called to me.

48
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,420
Tastes like peach. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

49
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:29,086
There's really nothing amazing about this. It's just candy.

50
00:02:29,086 --> 00:02:31,360
It's just a video of me eating candy.

51
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:31,960
*ASMR intensifies*

52
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,540
Almost marginally better than the video of me eating pretzels, I guess. (Hell's worst nightmare was annoyed)

53
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:38,140
This one says &quot;bio-rum&quot; (drink up, me hearties), no, &quot;bio-plum&quot;, sorry

54
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,800
&quot;bio-pineapple&quot;. Why does it say &quot;bio&quot;?

55
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,620
bah-ee-oh

56
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,760
ta-doo-mat

57
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,280
*good job*

58
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,660
Why does it say &quot;bio&quot;? It says &quot;bio&quot; everywhere.

59
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,140
On the label it wasn't even &quot;bio&quot;.

60
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:50,860
Oh, no!

61
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,200
Bah-ee-oh

62
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,480
Why? (Wae?)

63
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,500
Bah-ee-oh

64
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,880
Ohhhh *sexy realization*

65
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,880
It's the brand.(really?) (Litters again)

66
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,520
GOTTA SWEEP SWEEP SWEEP

67
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:09,040
Alright, so tell me with the next one, I'm gonna introduce my first guest.

68
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,200
Tomo

69
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,900
People: Tomo? Who is it? Tomo?

70
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,340
Mom: In Japan

71
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,340
I've been calling you Tomo this whole time.

72
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,460
*Laughter*

73
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:23,300
That's what you introduced me as. You respond to Tomo when I said &quot;Tomo&quot;.

74
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,320
Tomo(?): Is in Japan. *NEW CHALLENGER*

75
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:29,320
You responded though. Every time I'm like, &quot;Hey, Tomo,&quot; you go, &quot;Hey, yes?&quot;

76
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,739
Mom: Tomo is on his way.

77
00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:32,580
You can't blame mEe

78
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,300
Tomo is GONE. *Intensiplier*

79
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,420
I am so sorry

80
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,500
This is embarrassing for me (mark's life)

81
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,560
because I've been here for four days now, and it's been &quot;Tomo&quot; every day

82
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,840
Mom: He said &quot;I told you&quot;

83
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,100
You didn't *stutter* - you- you didn't tell me!

84
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,020
Mom: Come on. It's okay.
Mark: It's not okay!

85
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,620
K, So what is your name?

86
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,520
Tomo(?): My name is Park Soo Young

87
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,180
I don't trust you.

88
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,180
*Laughter*

89
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,260
Soo Young: Is really! I am Park Soo Young.

90
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,120
It is? Ok, come here.

91
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,420
*dat wave doh*

92
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,740
This is Soo Young.

93
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,060
Soo Young: Hello.

94
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:09,240
So I'll let you pick - whoever you are - what candy

95
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,880
Mark: Uh, uh, uh, uh

96
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,140
*Korean* How many candy

97
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,800
Mom: *Korean* Which.
Mark: *Korean* Which!

98
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,460
*le rip*

99
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:18,680
It's like Warheads!

100
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,300
Ah-ee-shuh

101
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,560
Le-mon mat

102
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,980
and bok-soong-ah mat?

103
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:31,180
Mom: Lemon taste, peach taste.

104
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,280
Mark: Oh
Mom: Do you know what &quot;Ah-ee-shuh&quot; mean?

105
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,100
Sour?

106
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,320
Mom: *dramatic whisper* Sour!

107
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,700
According-- You couldn't see this, but my mom went, 
&quot; 'Ah-ee-shuh' means *even more dramatic gasp* Sour!&quot;

108
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,540
Heeeey-what-sek?

109
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:45,760
Soo Young: Boon-hong-sek.
(&quot;Pink&quot; in Korean)

110
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,660
Mark: Hyong-sek.
Soo Young: Boon-hong-sek.
(&quot;Pink&quot; in Korean)

111
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:52,440
Mark: Boo-nong?
Soo Young: Boon-hong.

112
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,060
Mark: I can't trust a word you say.

113
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,640
So, you wanna try this at the same time?

114
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,900
Soo Young: Yeah. I trust.

115
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,900
Mark: You trust? Me?

116
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,180
Soo Young: Yeah. I trust you.

117
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:03,960
Oh, that's so sweet. And naïve. Okay.

118
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,320
*Oof* candy saved

119
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,180
Cheers.

120
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,180
Soo Young: *CRUNCH*

121
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,500
*mark does the curiousity*

122
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,500
*crunch crunch*

123
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,280
*hushed laughter from family*

124
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,180
How strong are your teeth?

125
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:22,840
You didn't make it last, though. Too fast!

126
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,080
*Crunch*

127
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,700
*intense mark breaking teeth*

128
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,920
*crunch*

129
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,020
Soo Young: Are you okay?

130
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,360
Mark: How do you say broken?

131
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,820
Soo Young: Boo-suh-jee-dah

132
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,860
Mark: All...boo-suh-jee-dah

133
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:41,320
So that was um, some kind of sour candy. Not quite equivalent to Warheads, but

134
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,320
pretty good, I liked those

135
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,640
*more shoves*

136
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,280
Mark: All right, please leave whoever you are

137
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,320
Soo Young: Ah, ok. Thank you.

138
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,120
*ninjaing*

139
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,480
*Mark.exe has stopped unexpectedly*

140
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:55,780
I am so sorry. Why is everyone been letting me get away with calling him &quot;Tomo&quot; this whole time?

141
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,120
*facepalm-a-SMACK*

142
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,240
Tom: Because it was funny

143
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:58,760
!!!

144
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,640
Oh, as if you knew! Did you know?

145
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,440
Tom: ...No

146
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,519
Yeah, get up here, you're next. Hyung-bae, you wait.

147
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:06,690
*laughs from ipliers*

148
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:09,589
All right, Thomas. Oh, this is my brother Thomas.

149
00:06:09,589 --> 00:06:10,469
Thomas: Hello.

150
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:13,380
Mark: Jason. It's funny, everyone here calls you Jason.

151
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:16,940
'Cuz you didn't change your name to Thomas until after you came to Korea.

152
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:20,460
Thomas: Yup.
Mark: Yeah. Wait, when did you start going by Thomas?

153
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:23,720
Thomas: Uh, first or second grade. Very early.
Mark: First or second grade. Yeah.

154
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,020
Okay, so you're Jason now.

155
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,120
Thomas: Yeah, that's how they know me.
Mark: That's how they know you now.

156
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,680
Mark: No one's gonna call you Tom.
Thomas: Aw.

157
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,620
Mark: I'm sorry. Anyway, this is Tom. So, you get to pick another candy.

158
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,720
Thomas: Whatever this is.
Mark: Okay, the squirty one.

159
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,900
Thomas: You'll have to read it.
Mark: Why do I have to read it?

162
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,460
Man-dul-gi. Man-dul-gi. I know that. What does it-

163
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,880
Mom: Make.

164
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,940
Mark: Oh, man-dul-gi. You make jelly?

165
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,820
Mark: Jja seo muk...

166
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,420
Mark: Jja seo muk...
Mom: JJA SEOK.
Thomas: Is this an activity?

167
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,840
Squeeze.

168
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,440
I think that's... Yeah, of course it's an activity. gotta SQUoozE It

169
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,460
Mark: There's a lot of Korean candies that involve some sort of 'squooozing'

170
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:06,500
*P L O P P*
Mark: Open it.

171
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,500
*Mark claps*

Thomas: They got gummies. I guess you put this on that?

177
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,260
Mark: I mean, I dunno what else you would put it on.

178
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:27,960
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° )

179
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,360

Mark: I don't like it.
Thomas: I like it.

190
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,120
Mark: Why??

191
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,500
Thomas: It's good.
Mark: In what world is this good?

192
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,460
Thomas: It's very good!
Mark: That was not good!

193
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,880
Thomas: Yeah!
Mark: That was awful.

194
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,520
Mark: It tastes like grease. (made from a grill?)

195
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,740
Mark: Maybe it's because I put a lot on mine.
Thomas: You did put a lot.

196
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,680
Mark: But mine tastes suspiciously like...

197
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,380
Petroleum. (petroleum jelly...?)

198
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,820
Mark: That's not what - hang on, wait.

199
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:15,320
Mark: Are these any good, then?

200
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,160
Mark: Here, have this.
Thomas: Thanks.

201

Thomas: What do you do?

204
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,280
Mark: Don't put it- put it where people can see it, where people can appreciate the texture of it.

205
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,480
*gummy reveal*

I guess I... guess I was I got what I asked for. (indeed)

207
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:37,460
So it's like there was a couple of these and these are juicy drops with other kind of squeezed flavor

*mark pondering existence*

00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,640
Mark: I'm so sorry

216
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,340
Mark: Oh, no..

217
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:07,600
Okay, so maybe this one's gonna be marginally different than the other one

218
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,100
Why isn't there some sort of safety thing?

219
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:12,600
There's not a lot of, like, sanitary precautions in a lot of food that I've seen.

220
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,820
I was at the grocery store and there was hamburger meat that was just sitting open in, like, a tub

221
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:20,800
next to this guy that was shouting into a microphone at the grocery store!

222
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,620
You know, the guy in the meat department just shouting into a microphone, like

223
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:26,220
&quot;We got meat! Come get meat!&quot; except in Korean

224
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,940
You know, he was saying that. I- I know Korean, he was saying exactly that.

225
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:32,340
Mark: Anyway, let's try this.
Thomas: All right.

226
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,820
*Moonch*

00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,900
Thomas: Yeah. Good.

229
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:41,440
Mark: In what world is that good???
Thomas: *Laughs* Bye

230
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,840
*Mark claps and family joins*

231
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:48,120
Alright, let me do one by myself. And then..

232
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,000
You two.

233
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,060
I know..

234
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:58,540
Unless you're gonna tell me that your name ain't Hyung-bae, we're gonna have a big problem.

235
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:01,420
All right. So this one jumped out at us

236
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:07,620
It's called Pine Needle Candy, and I've heard of pine nuts. Is that the same kind of deal? No different?

237
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,940
Pine nuts aren't from pine cones? Are pine nuts from pine cones?

238
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,360
Mom: I think it's pine...

239
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,640
Pine needle flavored

240
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,900
I bet... my money

241
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,920
You bet your mo- How much money?

242
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,840
*momiplier sigh*

243
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,120
A lot

244
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,080
1,000!

245
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:24,800
Won. *laugh*

246
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,280
(1000 won is about $1)

247
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:31,170
I'll take that bet. I got- I got you. *ka-ching*

248
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:34,640
Okay, not that I've ever eaten a pine needle before, but I got you.

249
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,307
Alright, Mom, you can- you come up here. You volunteered for this.

250
00:10:37,307 --> 00:10:41,060
Why are you dancing your way in??

251
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:44,800
I don't think anyone saw it, but it was just this sashay, just like, &quot;Ah~ la la la~&quot;

252
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,800
Mom: I was waiting for this moment, that's why.

253
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,100
Mark: Oh, ok. Where's your money?

254
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,560
Mom: Oh...

255
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,920
Do you take credit card?

256
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:57,620
Mark: All right, whatever.
Mom: I don't need to put money here because I know I'm gonna win this one.

257
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:01,120
Mark: All right, sure. I mean, it's not exactly an unsafe bet.

258
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:06,400
This- it has pine cones and pine needles on it. I'm assuming...

259
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,760
*sniff* That doesn't smell good

260
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:13,120
*sniff* Mmm~

261
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,020
How's my hair? Good?

262
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,840
*Korean* Pretty?

263

*clapping*

264
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,080
Mmm~

265
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,500
Mark: I don't- what- Wait, I didn't say go.
Mom: Oh, sorry.

266
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,560
Mark: Well, don't spit it back out!

267
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,700
Mark: Okay, here we go..

268
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,460
Mark: Doesn't really taste like pine needles.

269
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:36,060
Mom: Mmm~ I'm not lying, I feel.

270
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:36,720
Mom: Pine needle.

271
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,720
Mark: What, now you feel the pine needle after I say it doesn't taste like pine needles?

272
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,720
Mom: Mmm~ *Korean* This is mine.

273
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,460
Mom: *English* This is mine!

274
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,180
Mark: Everyone can tell you just said- no- what- no!

275
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,180
Th-th-that's not decided! ..Just take it and leave.

276
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:51,820
Mom: You know why? You have no idea what it's like, the pine needles smell like.

277
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,160
So if I said this is like it,

278
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,740
It is like it.

279

00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,280
Mark: Ah, &quot;you're welcome&quot;

311
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,760
Mark: &quot;Don't worry about it.&quot;
Hyung-bae: Ah, don't worry about it.

312
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:30,890
Mark: I taught him that. I told them it was real fancy, which it is

313
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:32,160
*wink of gods*

314
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,880
Mark: Oh, there's candy?

315
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,040
Hyung-bae: Strawberry.
Mark: I don't believe you.

316
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:41,440
Hyung-bae: You first. Ok. You eating.

317
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,540
*disgust*

318
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:47,040
Hyung-bae: No, no! Don't eat!

319
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,120
Mark: Oh, wow!

320
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,080
Hyung-bae: Yeah. Strawberry.
Mark: Strawberry.

321
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,200
Hyung-bae: Yeah. Ddal-gi (&quot;strawberry&quot; in Korean)

322
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:58,980
Mark: Ddal-gi?
Hyung-bae: Yeah. Ddal-gi.

323
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:03,060
*Hyung-bae with no emotion as markiplier fills with disgust*

324
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,860
Mom: Sour?
Hyung-bae: Sour.

325
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:09,260
Mark: No. Bad. It tastes like a worse Flintstone vitamin

326
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:09,880
Here.

327
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,680
*throw*

328
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:17,840
Okay. Really- oh? Hang on- oh? Uh..

329
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:22,080
Mark: No, not broke. No, no, no, no...

330
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,220
Hyung-bae: Good, good. Success.

331
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:27,380
Mark: Is it done? It's got a little finger- haha

332
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:30,020
It's got a little &quot;eey&quot; *laughs*

333
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,520
He's got little finger guns!

334
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,700
Mark: Oh, he's so cute. Here you go. 
Hyung-bae: Ha. Thank you.

335
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,960
Mark: You're welcome.

336
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,860
Mark &amp; Hyung-bae: *Korean* Thank you.

337
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:39,900
Mark: Jinx.

338
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,510
Anyway, Hyung-bae...

339
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:44,870
We have pictures together when we were

340
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:47,360
Little babies. Uh..

341
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,060
Mark: Oh nyun..
Hyung-bae: Da-suh-sal

342
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:53,740
Mark: Da-suh-sal
Hyung-bae: Five years old.

343
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,000
Mark: Five..?

344
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,780
Mom: *Korean* &quot;When we were around 5 years old&quot;

345
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:59,100
Mark: Tiny bit. Here. Here they are. Pictures.

346
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,100
*edit magic*

347
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,140
Mark: *whisper* I'm gonna add 'em in later.

348
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:05,040
Mark: There they are. 
Hyung-bae: Picture?

349
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,980
Mark: Many pictures.
Hyung-bae: Ah, many picture.

350
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:10,660
Mark: Yeah, see? They're going by right now.

351
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:14,500
*finger guns into existence*
Mark: There's another. Kachow! And another one.

352
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,080
Hyung-bae: Wow.
Mark: Oh, found one here.

353
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:20,900
Mark: Thank you. I've got one more guest

354
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:24,400
People: Yeo-jin
Mark: Yeo-jin...

355
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,320
Has your name changed?

356
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,880
Introduce yourself!

357
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,340
Yeo-jin: My name is Yeo-jin.

358
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,320
Mark: Here, pick this one. How's my hair?

359
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,960
Mom: She's a hair dresser

360
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:38,000
Mark: Something's wrong with this head. See? See that?

361
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,200
Oh

362
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:45,900
Where was the candy?

363
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,980
Well, I'll work on this then...

364
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,400
♫I will remember you♫

365
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,260
Got it!

366
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:55,900
Oh, Maltese?

367
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,000
Yeo-jin: *Korean* Do we have to make this?

368
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,980
Mark: That's basically Maltese. And is gonna take a while.

369
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:04,100
♫calm, nintendogs-esque music♫

370
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:07,200
*finishes*
Mark: There it goes.

371
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,300
Mark: There you go.

372
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,980
Yeo-jin: Thank you.
Mark: You're welcome.

373
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,300
Yeo-jin: Thank you.
Mark: You're welcome.

374
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,680
*laughter*

375
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:19,440
*intense claps*

376
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,070
So

377
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:24,780
We've made it through a lot of candy. I think we ran out of special guests

378
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:30,960
So I guess I gotta carry this on myself, which really reflects my personality because the next one I picked was this minion one

379
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:34,620
Just 'cuz it really fascinated me with the fact there was minion in this

380
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,300
*house reveal 3.0*

381
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,820
So when we first got here there was this guy

384
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,740
So I was like, hey, it's my favorite. And it was Wade's favorite, of course

385
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:48,360
so I had to get it. But I don't think it'll be actually any different, so I'm assuming it's just like

*more of the disgust*

392
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,680
Mmm!

393
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:10,220
There's really nothing different. This says megamouth strawberry flavor, and I don't know what strawberries they drew this from

394
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:13,340
I think they just diluted down some cough syrup

395
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:16,500
and put it into a spray bottle.

396
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:21,340
Anybody want? Spray? Hyung-bae, get over here. Just open your mouth.

397
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,340
Say &quot;Aah&quot;

401
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,980
Alright, so that's just as bad as it would be in America.

402
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,080
*CLUNK*

403
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,700
That was a trash can.

Why?

416

Why would you need the make cho- Well, I guess the chocolate pudding is a thing, and that's not too far off.

Mom: What's that?

421
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,480
Mom: Fungus!

422
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,300
Fungus?

423
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,340
Mom: Look like fungus.

424
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,880
Mark: That does?
Mom: Yeah.

425
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,200
Mom: Look like a rat. Fungus.

426
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,680
Rat? A fungus? Wait, you can't just keep saying words and expect that to mean anything.

427
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,500
Mom: [quietly] i'm sorry!

428
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,900
you don't know fungus?

Mom, you're hilarious,

434
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,220
but hang on. Do you think it's actually covered in fungus or do you think it just looks-

435
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:50,000
Mom: Yeah, looks that way from this distance.

People: *Korean* Rubber?

444
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,260
Mom: Roober!

Soo-Young: Roober!

00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:20,120
Mark: Rubber! Ah, rubber, okay. Yeah, I would equate it to that. Yeah.

447
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:20,940
Bad!

448
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:23,840
Soo Young: I'll trash it. 
Mark: Trash it? Good idea.

*off screen disgust*
Mark: Yeah, I know.

451
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,120
Who else wants to try 'em? Hyung-bae? It's all gonna give us food poisoning.

452
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,760
There. Thomas, here.

What are you smiling at over there?

My brother's just smiling over there.

*CRUNCH*

466
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,680
Ow, I bit my lip. *smack*

467
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,710
Not that bad, not that good.

468
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:14,040
I've got some more candy here, but I'm not even gonna bother it because I- I think I'm about done

469
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,240
I wanted to end it on

470
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,040
*ploop*

471
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:17,680
*falls*

472
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,520
*RIP*

473
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,680
I wanted to end it with

474
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:27,000
something that I'm familiar with because I just wanted to see how it changed when it came down to

475
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,580
umm

476
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:31,780
being in Korea. If this was made in Korea, then that's good.

477
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:34,000
Gan-chi gi-nah, gong-bu

478
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,840
Gong-bu?

479
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,080
I know what &quot;study&quot; is.. I was marveling why &quot;study&quot; was in here

480
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,600
Dung-san oon-dong hal-dae

481
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,280
Un-jae, Uh-dee-suh nah

482
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,820
What does it mean?
*Appluase*

483
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,140
Why are you clapping?

484
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:52,140
Mom: Activity snack!

485
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,140
Mom: Wow, wonderful!

486
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:54,820
*scared mark... we can save you*

487
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:55,380
Oh.

488
00:20:55,380 --> 00:21:01,140
Okay, so in Korea, it's a study snack?

489
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:04,000
Tastes like Snickers... Okay. So that'll wrap it up.

490
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,750
Ummmmm

491
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:07,090
Conclusion. I went out of my way to pick the weird ones

492
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:12,309
So I think the fact that I did that means that I didn't enjoy some of them

493
00:21:12,309 --> 00:21:14,820
But a lot of them just taste like candy

494
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:19,740
So I don't know what I expected out of this, and I have no conclusions to draw one way or another.

495
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:25,120
I'm not gonna make any comparisons because I can't say one's better than the other. So...

496
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,800
What's the moral of the story here?

497
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,789
*Extremely intense* Try different experiences, learn new things,

498
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:35,020
study other cultures through their candy, and you'll have a good life.

499
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:37,259
Snack activity with family, right?

500
00:21:37,259 --> 00:21:38,950
*Painfully awkward silence*

501
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:40,720
...Right...?

502
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,200
Family: Yaaayy!!! *Applause*

503
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,220
So thank you everybody so much for watching. If you ever want to go to Korea, I recommend it

504
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:50,240
I've been having a great time with my family, been learning a lot of things,

505
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:55,300
Uh.. got a lot of stories to tell that I'll tell later, but thanks everybody so much, and check out my...

506

509
