74
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,280
outside there is no fucking way that the

75
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,960

00:03:45,850 --> 00:04:06,220
oh oh patched up the next one we have is

83
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,220
flex seal flex seal liquid let's have a

84
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,170
look at this oh great fill our

85
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:13,660
Prometheus what fire of knowledge do you

86
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,970
bring to us mortals today bill Swift

87
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:19,150
here four flex seal the easy way to stop

88
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:20,200
leaks fast

89
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,330
that's a colander Phil it's supposed to

90
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:24,670
have holes and leaks which you've done

91
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:26,530
is essentially you've made a bowl the

92
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:29,260
easy way to stop leaks fast Phil you

93
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:32,740
make me angry Phil couldn't just grab

94
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,580
one of these Phil don't need flex seal

95
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:39,340
look at its curvature and the easy way

96
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,650
to have a bowl without creating one out

97
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:44,440
of a colander and now there's flex seal

98
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,110
liquid this super thick rubber that you

99
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,750
could pour right into cracks could you

100
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,640
could pour it right in the cracks you

101
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,150
could do that but why why would you do

102
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:57,190
that why would you do any event even dip

103
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:00,370
all your tools for a tough no slip grip

104
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:03,650
even dip all your tools I can understand

105
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:05,030
the other two like there's some

106
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:06,919
application but how do you go from like

107
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:08,780
you can stop water from going through

108
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:11,150
cracks weatherproof some of your outdoor

109
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:13,550
materials dip your tools in this shit I

110
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:14,270
don't know

111
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,070
this product is worthless in its current

112
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:18,650
state now that's good just get that

113
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:20,720
break in there just soak that right up

114
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,520
