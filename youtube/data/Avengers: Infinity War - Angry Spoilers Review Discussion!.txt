1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:17,939
okay welcome to the spoiler section oh

2
00:00:17,939 --> 00:00:23,250
my god they fucking did it Joe Joe Joe

3
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,500
they fucking did it I didn't think

4
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,490
they'd have the balls to kill to look

5
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:35,379
Deadpool to kill all of our characters

6
00:00:35,379 --> 00:00:37,750
not all of them okay I wanted everyone

7
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:41,410
dead but it was like it actually is

8
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,750
really fucking close it's more than half

9
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:48,760
in my opinion it's it's 14 I'm thinking

10
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,649
it's more around 14 I don't know the

11
00:00:50,649 --> 00:00:51,370
exact count

12
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:53,440
I'm gonna go re-watch the film see

13
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,450
everybody who turns into ashes I'm sure

14
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:57,070
I might have missed maybe some of the

15
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:59,140
decide will condemn characters that

16
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:02,320
maybe I missed but Black Panther who

17
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,600
let's try to run it okay so before we

18
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,460
saw the film we said how many characters

19
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:09,460
are gonna die Joe all right what did you

20
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:15,580
say I said three freeze Disney three and

21
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:19,450
he's actually the closest because as you

22
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:21,759
go throughout the film characters die in

23
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,090
battle and then at the end you get a

24
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:29,310
massive body counts because Thanos

25
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:33,970
fucking wins I can't believe it Disney

26
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:37,539
I'm so proud of you I'm feel like a dad

27
00:01:37,539 --> 00:01:39,880
today and you've finally grown up and

28
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,069
you've said you know what you can you

29
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:44,830
can cry cry everybody in the theater

30
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:48,160
little kids run out crying because your

31
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,899
favorite characters are dead

32
00:01:49,899 --> 00:01:55,270
they're Ash and what really got me the

33
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:58,360
most emotional thing in the film was Tom

34
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,970
Holland or as a Peter Parker as

35
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:02,950
spider-man begging for his life

36
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:05,800
dude that that got me dude because I

37
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,399
like I like his character and he grabbed

38
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:11,500
on to Tony Stark and he's like I don't

39
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,209
want to die I don't want to go I know I

40
00:02:13,209 --> 00:02:14,970
don't want to go and he's fading and

41
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:19,989
Tony is like and he melts away in his

42
00:02:19,989 --> 00:02:21,590
arms practically

43
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:25,160
and that one got me you know some of the

44
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,800
other ones didn't give me as much

45
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,620
because but it was just a motion because

46
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:36,620
they're just they're shocked and then

47
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,569
they fall apart in your life and your

48
00:02:38,569 --> 00:02:40,220
brain can't even process it

49
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:43,670
star-lord would know Chris Pratt was it

50
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:48,190
no Black Panther who else

51
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:51,349
everybody is God basically everybody

52
00:02:51,349 --> 00:02:57,049
from the guardians of the galaxy

53
00:02:57,049 --> 00:03:02,780
that mantis gone Drax gone more Gamora

54
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:05,150
she splattered on the ground she really

55
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:07,220
died right so the people who like really

56
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,230
died in the film went without the snap

57
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,819
of the fingers thing was like Gamora is

58
00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:13,160
the first one to go right vision goes

59
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,319
but he I mean he dies he gets his

60
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:16,790
forehead ripped off yeah

61
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:19,069
so they it culminates in this they have

62
00:03:19,069 --> 00:03:21,260
two separate battles you've got a battle

63
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:24,950
on Titan with Thanos versus Doctor

64
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:28,400
Strange Tony Stark the guardians of the

65
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,880
galaxy and spider-man and it is so

66
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:35,569
awesome to see like how the fuck do you

67
00:03:35,569 --> 00:03:37,910
really portray a battle with stones

68
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:41,540
based on soul time reality fuck it's

69
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:44,090
crazy to think about but they actually

70
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,829
did it justice yeah there's some

71
00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:47,510
concepts that they've watered down a

72
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:49,579
little bit because it is a movie after

73
00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:52,280
all but they still manage to convey the

74
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,799
sense of power he fucking takes a moon

75
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,010
and he like freakin destroys a moon and

76
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:00,260
brings it down not everybody in

77
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,209
spider-man has to be like I can't keep

78
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:06,440
this up you know Tony's flying it it was

79
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:10,760
amazing and they they have him they have

80
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,250
fake notes and then ripping off the

81
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:16,340
Infinity Gauntlet so that was stupidest

82
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,750
part of the movie the Gilligan's Island

83
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:25,639
moment where they I was there they have

84
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:27,349
they have him like mesmerized because

85
00:04:27,349 --> 00:04:29,030
mantis is on there like trying to subdue

86
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:29,480
him

87
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,560
and they're trying to rip the gutless

88
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,810
off his hand completely restrained and

89
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:34,430
this is he man sitting there like just

90
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:36,080
like jiggling while they're pulling this

91
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,760
glove off and they almost have it off

92
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,290
actually they get it almost completely

93
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:41,750
half of his hand and that Gilligan shows

94
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,640
up and gets mad that his girlfriend's

95
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,560
dead and he starts punching Thanos in

96
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,020
the face and that was snakes break she

97
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,880
wasn't horrible like there was no

98
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,610
written like I was so upset I was like I

99
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:54,050
was glad when star-lord died after that

100
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:56,990
it was like you're stupid yeah um I'm

101
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:00,890
not as mad as Alex because I can see how

102
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:03,560
he was it just was I don't think it's a

103
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,110
negative as you do you think perhaps

104
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,330
it's lazy writing I think no that's a

105
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:10,580
trick there's trouble it's definitely a

106
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,050
trouble there's no doubt about that but

107
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:14,240
is it appropriate for star-lord to lose

108
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,680
a shit over Gamora yet yes and no I

109
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,930
think maybe he would be able to contain

110
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:25,250
his anger or or maybe nebula would would

111
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,410
restrain him because remember nebula is

112
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,750
she's just watching this and she wants

113
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,660
they knows is dead as much as anybody so

114
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:35,600
so yeah and I can see in that sense it's

115
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,420
very frustrating to see star-lord is the

116
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:41,510
one that fucks it up for every is the

117
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,490
reason that half the people in the

118
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:44,270
universe

119
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:47,390
died yeah so he has a lot to fucking

120
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:50,990
make up for and apologize for and it's

121
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,370
funny the star-lord because I can

122
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:54,140
already see him making a joke about it

123
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,660
they kind of joke about our he's getting

124
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:01,010
fat I think maybe he actually is hitting

125
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:03,350
the gym this hard and it was just a

126
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:06,140
funny and it starts to talk like toys

127
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:09,890
and you're not taking my my shirt any is

128
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:11,450
like there you go are you lowering your

129
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:16,550
voice love I love the way Thor talks and

130
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,440
does see star-lord do that so there's

131
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,590
there's really good jokes in this film

132
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:25,250
and it's it's crazy there there's so

133
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,550
much to talk about so Doctor Strange

134
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:31,640
does something very surprising and I

135
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,550
think I'm actually more upset with

136
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:37,730
Doctor Strange than I am with star-lord

137
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,540
because Doctor Strange is like

138
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,310
I am protecting this time stone and

139
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,870
there's nothing that can make it like

140
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:45,660
even you spider-man and Tony Ark Tony

141
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,760
Stark if if it's between y'all and the

142
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,770
time stone y'all are dead yeah I'm in a

143
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:51,960
particular 10 to 14 million futures and

144
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,900
solve it all of them die except for Tony

145
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:58,500
yeah I well no no no no no no I think

146
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,330
you're twisting that out of control the

147
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:03,030
only one wants it in one way they do it

148
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:04,890
in one way so I'm thinking they're going

149
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:07,320
the same place I'm going that he had to

150
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,180
get he knows that they all die no matter

151
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,460
what so he has to make it so that Tony

152
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,770
Lee yes okay yeah I know but it's still

153
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:15,540
but it's that one frustrating thing

154
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:18,150
where you ask you so why did you do it

155
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,800
why did you do it because it leads to

156
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,840
all business but you're chosen he has

157
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,630
exactly it's the time stone when he was

158
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,640
doing this and he was freaking out I was

159
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,350
like oh shit is he malfunctioning no

160
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,760
he's looking into all the different

161
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:33,630
futures and so that is definitely set up

162
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:36,270
but you're right you're like damn it's

163
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:39,870
just it's frustrating and so obviously

164
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:42,750
they they almost beat Thanos and the

165
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:47,580
wakandans combined with the you know the

166
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,380
Rogues I don't know what to call them

167
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,390
New Avengers Scarlett they're they're

168
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:54,630
kind of outlaws which is a stupid story

169
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,720
language the government wasn't so

170
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,230
fucking stupid

171
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:00,480
right cuz they're still like outlaws

172
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,610
hopefully they get a pardon after all

173
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:05,220
this shit right but anyways so they team

174
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,140
up with Wakanda and they do that battle

175
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:09,840
and they start winning and you know it's

176
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,580
a hard-fought battle and I thought it

177
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:16,890
was visually pet peeve where were the

178
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:19,770
horns and the Rhinos so they're so

179
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:26,450
dangerous

180
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:29,070
so I've that seen rump like maybe like

181
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:32,220
Matson was so amazing it made me mad

182
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,950
more mad about black panther where I

183
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:37,830
love 95% of black panther except for the

184
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:39,360
end because the climax of black panther

185
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,910
was kind of lame it just like it was

186
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:45,150
like 2020 CBI 500 not just CGI fight it

187
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,280
was like 20 people running around they

188
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,140
saved it for this for this one because

189
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,060
there is

190
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:54,020
brave heart level is gigantic hi super

191
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,060
cool and I can't wait to see that I just

192
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,520
have my home screen so I can marvel at

193
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,930
all the different individual guys

194
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:03,380
because I once see he's like hey we're

195
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,060
actually seeing more of a kind of this

196
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:08,510
time oh I said I said that when we went

197
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:10,810
over to this mountain we saw multiple

198
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:12,650
skyscrapers and buildings and different

199
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,570
streets the same alley with and I was

200
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:16,760
like we see we see more of makanda in

201
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,130
this film than we do in black panther it

202
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:21,200
was crazy but yeah that was super

203
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,750
satisfying and they they managed to even

204
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:27,770
make some poignant jokes making fun of

205
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:29,630
the fact that it's a comic book movie

206
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:32,720
for example Scarlet Witch stays up in

207
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,830
the tower the whole time while

208
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:35,390
everybody's working their ass off

209
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:37,850
sweating and beating the shit and

210
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:40,670
bruiser style and then finally she comes

211
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:44,120
down or and then she helps out when some

212
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,540
razor tank on she murders a bunch of is

213
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:51,020
fucking crazy and then the what condon

214
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,060
were one of the royal guards the Royal

215
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:56,030
Guard leader she's like well I would see

216
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,680
if there's the whole time and I was like

217
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,990
exactly that's what I was saying but it

218
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,520
wasn't like a frustrating thing it was

219
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,320
like it yeah the get your ass Daphnia

220
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,640
her you know because she was probably

221
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,520
over there protecting vision a really

222
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,650
good job I'm making sure like the

223
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,930
battles are staged and individual teams

224
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:14,030
going out doing their own thing Thor

225
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,010
restarting a forge in order to get a

226
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:19,280
brand new hammer now Thor has an axe get

227
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,960
out of here there's like God of War this

228
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,730
is got a board mimicking Marvel and now

229
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:24,830
Marvel making mimicking god of war here

230
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:28,010
and and Groot handle it Groot is the

231
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:32,240
handle it's are not great himself it is

232
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,510
kind of screwed but yes groots arm is

233
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,730
the is the handle for his axe and when

234
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:40,850
Thor comes it's so fucking tight because

235
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:43,610
it's the god a god is fighting with you

236
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,530
and you're like yes and if I was one of

237
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:47,209
those wakandans and I saw him Donovan

238
00:10:47,209 --> 00:10:52,779
Joe everyone right and they do win until

239
00:10:52,779 --> 00:10:55,970
everything goes calm and and what I kick

240
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:58,430
their ass they started treating and they

241
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:00,020
blow up all their ships before they can

242
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,330
retreat but then it gets real calm and

243
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:02,850
they

244
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:05,639
those ports over once he gets all of the

245
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:08,160
Infinity stones from the battle on Titan

246
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,339
comes back to her one right thing

247
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:11,940
exactly

248
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:14,250
all but one you know and and he gets

249
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:18,120
there and he just wrecks one by one all

250
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,949
of our heroes like they're nothing is

251
00:11:19,949 --> 00:11:22,199
the slow-mo scene and then it was well

252
00:11:22,199 --> 00:11:25,199
done well executed and you see that you

253
00:11:25,199 --> 00:11:28,529
know Captain America you know holding

254
00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:31,709
that the Infinity Gauntlet from the

255
00:11:31,709 --> 00:11:38,519
trailers but I like the fact that he got

256
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:40,470
some shots up in there he's the only one

257
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:42,569
that really got some shots on Thanos and

258
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:44,399
then he got taken out Hulk in the

259
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:45,600
beginning is they wanted to beat up

260
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,130
famous the the best but there was a

261
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:51,870
bitch she didn't want to come back out

262
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:54,990
this made Holt a bitch he got some

263
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:59,910
explaining to do yes no oh yeah but he

264
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,709
gets in Veronica and then he beats him

265
00:12:01,709 --> 00:12:03,779
but I like this character Court of the

266
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:05,819
Hulk that he's like a fucking kid and

267
00:12:05,819 --> 00:12:07,709
your hat and he doesn't do what you want

268
00:12:07,709 --> 00:12:10,980
him to do when you want him to do it

269
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,680
we got some talking to do is what a

270
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,779
banner says banner doesn't die right so

271
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:18,269
he's still arranged so he can have this

272
00:12:18,269 --> 00:12:20,310
discussion I don't know if this is

273
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:23,939
setting up an actual banner film you

274
00:12:23,939 --> 00:12:26,279
know an independent one that he can sort

275
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:29,279
this issue out so but one thing I have a

276
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,589
problem with in the Marvel Universe now

277
00:12:31,589 --> 00:12:32,970
is I don't want to see anything I don't

278
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:34,889
want to see ant-man it's not gonna make

279
00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:37,470
sense to me oh yes okay so I go in a so

280
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:40,410
they didn't make one they made a one

281
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:42,149
reference I was wondering why was I kept

282
00:12:42,149 --> 00:12:44,939
expecting anything show up I really kept

283
00:12:44,939 --> 00:12:46,560
expecting this show up but it's like no

284
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,540
they had to go into hiding because of

285
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,430
the public thing that happened and they

286
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:53,160
drop one mention of it the guy in charge

287
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,639
and ant-man is it and manners I read

288
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,910
animation now you know so so they're

289
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:02,730
yeah they're not explained that would be

290
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:05,160
the only one that I would have preferred

291
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,980
them to be in it but I guess in order to

292
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,649
see wasp and ant-man

293
00:13:09,649 --> 00:13:12,630
they need it I mean in the beginning of

294
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:13,320
that movie they

295
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,389
say you know six months earlier just so

296
00:13:15,389 --> 00:13:16,680
I don't believe that half of Earth is

297
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,750
dead well this is gonna be interesting

298
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:22,649
because that world now is half populated

299
00:13:22,649 --> 00:13:25,019
because civilians are dying too so that

300
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:27,329
was the one thing about the Thanos thing

301
00:13:27,329 --> 00:13:30,149
that I I didn't at first when I heard it

302
00:13:30,149 --> 00:13:31,139
on-screen

303
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:33,209
he wants to kill half of everything I'm

304
00:13:33,209 --> 00:13:37,319
like it's fucking stupid I want they

305
00:13:37,319 --> 00:13:39,120
knows to be Thanos I want to kill

306
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,069
everything you know

307
00:13:41,069 --> 00:13:46,230
but over time I grew to like it and he

308
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:47,910
explained it's a different it's a

309
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,009
different take on Thanos and I don't

310
00:13:50,009 --> 00:13:51,060
hate it anymore

311
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:54,870
I they not he's it makes him more

312
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:57,300
complex in my opinion it makes him more

313
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,060
interesting you know he's not

314
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:05,100
necessarily malicious or pure evil he is

315
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:08,370
literally a mad Titan I mean he wholly

316
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:10,620
believes that he is doing the right

317
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,690
thing and I like that and I wish they

318
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:14,130
would have played it up a little bit

319
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:16,800
more I thought it was gonna be from

320
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,209
Thanos his point of view that would have

321
00:14:18,209 --> 00:14:20,220
been really interesting but it wasn't it

322
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,440
was you know we had pockets of teens and

323
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,940
we had to get all the jokes in and all

324
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,589
the Avengers and and they did the right

325
00:14:25,589 --> 00:14:28,829
thing by doing it like that though I do

326
00:14:28,829 --> 00:14:30,720
have that alternate film in my head up

327
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,010
from Thanos this point of view yeah so

328
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:36,990
everybody dies we have 14 major hero

329
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:39,000
deaths at the end probably the number is

330
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,699
probably wrong but we'll go back and

331
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:45,060
look and it opens it up so the final

332
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,240
scene job what is it

333
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,579
they are the after credit scene Nick

334
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:53,579
Fury is sending a message before he to

335
00:14:53,579 --> 00:14:56,699
he turns into does him in his agent

336
00:14:56,699 --> 00:15:01,019
reason yeah a galactic beeper is a

337
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:04,459
beeper it's a galactic beeper and

338
00:15:04,459 --> 00:15:07,170
Captain Marvel symbol is on there and it

339
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:09,509
is the red and blue symbol because we've

340
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:11,069
seen some behind the set photos where

341
00:15:11,069 --> 00:15:13,019
she's green yeah and that's probably

342
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:14,490
just a flashback er when she was in her

343
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:16,290
military uniform or something like that

344
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,899
so I'm excited for that film I actually

345
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:19,720
kind of

346
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,829
I don't know for some reason I thought

347
00:15:20,829 --> 00:15:22,870
maybe she would show up here and sort of

348
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:25,300
help him out and and that would that was

349
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,980
the direction they would have gone if

350
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,600
they didn't have any balls you know what

351
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,220
I mean if they actually stopped Thanos

352
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,680
and stop the fight short he retreats and

353
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,060
then the second film as it comes back

354
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,040
with a second time where she lay helps

355
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,040
him out no he wins and I'm so happy

356
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,620
because you're doing the comics justice

357
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,839
yes you didn't do the storyline exactly

358
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,060
like the comics you know and I I'm

359
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:48,699
almost thankful for that too but you had

360
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:51,519
the balls to kill everybody off now we

361
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,879
all know that the heroes are coming back

362
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:58,120
I mean we know that but um oh it isn't

363
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,339
an interesting way now because what you

364
00:16:00,339 --> 00:16:03,129
can do with this is if certain people

365
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:05,920
drop out of their contracts they can

366
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,439
either ream aterial eyes as brand new

367
00:16:08,439 --> 00:16:10,449
actors they could come in as the old

368
00:16:10,449 --> 00:16:12,670
actors and only do cameos and other

369
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:15,459
films as they age oh that's the old

370
00:16:15,459 --> 00:16:18,430
Steve Rogers the old Captain America you

371
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:20,439
know as we go along or they can come

372
00:16:20,439 --> 00:16:22,689
back in full force and and do their

373
00:16:22,689 --> 00:16:25,449
extended films but now this gives an

374
00:16:25,449 --> 00:16:29,170
opportunity for Marvel phase 5 or face

375
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:31,269
bore I don't know where somewhere

376
00:16:31,269 --> 00:16:33,490
they're for new people to take up the

377
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:35,769
mantle with a few old people cuz you not

378
00:16:35,769 --> 00:16:37,809
definitely know tony has got a large

379
00:16:37,809 --> 00:16:39,670
role in this

380
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:44,079
in fact Thanos recognizes star well you

381
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:45,819
know he just has a soul Jim and so he

382
00:16:45,819 --> 00:16:48,129
can breathe he is oh yeah the axis of

383
00:16:48,129 --> 00:16:50,649
the knowledge so but but but still he

384
00:16:50,649 --> 00:16:52,300
knows you're a really nice speech race

385
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,800
just like look you're gonna die and I'm

386
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,389
you're like real brave and I'm are you

387
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,670
and I hope they remember you yeah that's

388
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:59,230
really nice and that was the other part

389
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:02,470
that got me when when Tony was was

390
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:05,470
stabbed and he was fighting his fucking

391
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:07,600
heart out dude and it was like that

392
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,209
scene it was like that scene in God of

393
00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:13,360
War which the brutality is there and his

394
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,130
armors just fucking ripped and he's

395
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:17,770
still going dude and you you're like man

396
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:20,589
Tony you're my hero dude you're my hero

397
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:22,659
and they fucking stabbed him and you

398
00:17:22,659 --> 00:17:23,980
think he's gonna die I thought he was

399
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:24,829
gonna die

400
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:27,169
fuck man if they make that the fifth or

401
00:17:27,169 --> 00:17:31,549
the I was like but no that's when dr.

402
00:17:31,549 --> 00:17:33,529
strange says don't kill him I'll give

403
00:17:33,529 --> 00:17:35,539
you the time stone and there's like no

404
00:17:35,539 --> 00:17:38,929
tricks gives in a time stone and and and

405
00:17:38,929 --> 00:17:42,049
gives him victory but I think dr.

406
00:17:42,049 --> 00:17:46,700
strange has a plan yeah so I hope he has

407
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,289
a plan because in the comics he's the

408
00:17:48,289 --> 00:17:50,090
one that kind of has the plan and puts

409
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:51,980
them in a pocket universe and stuff so

410
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,480
so they're doing something different

411
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:57,320
here what about the villains sub-bosses

412
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,149
let's talk about those guys I've never

413
00:17:59,149 --> 00:18:01,909
read their well I I I don't remember the

414
00:18:01,909 --> 00:18:04,340
comics were those guys in the Infinity

415
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:08,240
yeah they are different they smash two

416
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,120
together to make them as is but yeah the

417
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,649
children of Thanos is what they're

418
00:18:12,649 --> 00:18:13,519
called I don't know if they're actually

419
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:15,559
children or just a sub generals but

420
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:18,639
you've got a wizard that uses these spy

421
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:21,169
telekinesis and and uses these spikes

422
00:18:21,169 --> 00:18:24,230
and and that's that's good because I

423
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:26,000
didn't expect these guys to be deep I

424
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,710
wanted them to be bruisers and that's

425
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:29,480
exactly where they were they were

426
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,880
threatening you when you open the film

427
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,289
right away they attack and they're

428
00:18:33,289 --> 00:18:34,820
fighting in there and they're in this

429
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:37,070
and and you get this sort of Russian

430
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:38,630
camera style along a straight

431
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:40,940
Steppenwolf where you just didn't care

432
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:43,399
yeah you cared and they did a good job

433
00:18:43,399 --> 00:18:45,110
of making sure are you alright

434
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,820
you know as because they're talking

435
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,679
about Thanos is coming you know Thanos

436
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:49,909
is coming and then before they even

437
00:18:49,909 --> 00:18:51,529
really have a chance to assemble the

438
00:18:51,529 --> 00:18:53,480
team like shit is going on outside and

439
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,340
then they pull this camera style where

440
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,630
you're like walking it I'm like oh my

441
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:58,370
god we're fucking in this dude or we've

442
00:18:58,370 --> 00:18:58,880
it ready

443
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:04,970
shit we're not ready it's just amazing

444
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:06,559
and they gave spider-man spider senses

445
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,269
which was but again

446
00:19:08,269 --> 00:19:10,309
spider-man homecoming was stupid because

447
00:19:10,309 --> 00:19:12,590
there's no spider senses I cannot wait

448
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:14,840
to go back and watch this again because

449
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,600
I really want to see all of it non-stop

450
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,690
action they did what I thought they

451
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:24,169
wouldn't do now you know kill a bunch of

452
00:19:24,169 --> 00:19:25,650
heroes you know

453
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:27,870
and the credits was almost like an

454
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:29,970
obituary he was just like normal it's

455
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,230
just black right

456
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:33,780
standard text one at a time like these

457
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:39,320
are all the people that died and so Wow

458
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,880
cool

459
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,490
great action great visuals there's some

460
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:47,309
emotional gravity there I will say that

461
00:19:47,309 --> 00:19:50,550
I expected more emotional gravity and I

462
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:54,030
think that that at a certain point isn't

463
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:58,380
he had to be like okay don't go to you

464
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,960
know deep with this death thing and go

465
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,260
too far because they could betray the

466
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:07,670
hero's dying in a much more emotional

467
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:12,150
wracking and yes but that was the one

468
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:13,770
that they allowed and that one was the

469
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:15,809
one that's in character he's literally

470
00:20:15,809 --> 00:20:18,660
the most inexperienced he's a he's a boy

471
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:21,179
he's a really small kid and he doesn't

472
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:22,770
want to die and he's like he's begging

473
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:24,300
for his life and it makes you want to

474
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,130
cry but they could have done some of the

475
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:28,110
other heroes in a more emotional way

476
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:37,800
we're gonna so so yeah we didn't even

477
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,000
talk about that so right at the

478
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,760
beginning you know the Asgardians are

479
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,559
fucking obliterated he says he kills

480
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:46,020
half of them but no he kills all of them

481
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:48,929
yeah so I don't know what he means by he

482
00:20:48,929 --> 00:20:51,690
killed how would one trip yeah so he

483
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:54,300
killed all the Asgardians unless I don't

484
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,100
know escape pods launched they're gonna

485
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:59,730
have to explain that later so heimdall

486
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:03,570
manages to Rainbow Road with a little

487
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:05,790
bit of power left get Hulk out of there

488
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:07,170
but it was weird because I thought I'd

489
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:09,540
heard him say the Dark Gods give me

490
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,340
power so you know that's about all

491
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,530
father give me Ben dark power he wants

492
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:16,290
he just wants um okay I guess I'm good

493
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:18,870
he's slightly Ybor he's got some evil

494
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:20,760
blood but he's using it for good I don't

495
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,830
know but manages to get Hulk out of

496
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:24,720
there though he probably should have

497
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,330
gotten lochia out of there - goddamn it

498
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:30,150
but is he can only take one and then

499
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:32,130
Loki dies at the beginning of the film

500
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:34,679
I totally anticipated looking be like

501
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:38,130
here take this and for my life no you

502
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,240
know and I'm probably

503
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,270
boy man he was like he's like I wholly

504
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:44,850
pledged myself to you but he shouldn't

505
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:47,640
have said the trickster god the son of a

506
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,920
Haskell he's like no no don't don't

507
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,110
mention that you are the god of mischief

508
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:56,070
and the god of tricksters he reveals his

509
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:58,830
blade and he makes an attempt it gets so

510
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:02,580
fucking close and I'm like yes dude Tom

511
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,860
Hiddleston had a glorious death and he

512
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:10,290
got choked off and and thorne loses his

513
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:12,270
mind when he sees his brother die and

514
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:19,730
his best friend yeah yeah so yeah

515
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:26,790
Heimdall Loki Gomorrah and vision are

516
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:30,600
the four deaths that occurred before the

517
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,670
garlic and then I think there was about

518
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:33,270
ten

519
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:35,730
you know ten nine ten eleven more after

520
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:38,130
he snapped his fingers and once he did

521
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:40,500
it he went into a different realm so

522
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,900
about his realm I thought I was like the

523
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,770
theater went silent and I was just in

524
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:48,300
Bret I was like in this brand-new

525
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,100
territory well it's like a different

526
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,809
place it's like where he lives now no no

527
00:22:51,809 --> 00:22:55,050
I'm not only in in realms but in movie

528
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:57,480
territory in comic book territory the

529
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,730
villain is going to win this film I knew

530
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:02,190
it at that point I was like that we've

531
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:04,140
never seen a film like this in the

532
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,410
Disney aspect in the Marvel Universe

533
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:09,990
where it's not all you know laughing at

534
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:11,840
the end and having jokes

535
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:16,440
it's somber at the end you lost and so

536
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,880
he goes into this other realm and I was

537
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:21,240
really expecting to see death I really

538
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,280
wanted to see death yeah because I like

539
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,620
I personally like the whole storyline

540
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,960
where he's madly in love and obsessed

541
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,880
with death and he does this all for

542
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,429
death that is completely gone that's cut

543
00:23:32,429 --> 00:23:34,650
out that's not this Thanos that's not

544
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:37,580
this storyline and for better or worse

545
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:41,700
he finds his daughter there in her

546
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,559
Tamura baby Gamora right

547
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,450
you know at first I was like what we

548
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:48,340
haven't he went to another planet to go

549
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,779
assault this other planet and I was like

550
00:23:49,779 --> 00:23:51,490
alright cool but no it was a flashback

551
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:55,659
scene to how he how he you know took

552
00:23:55,659 --> 00:23:57,039
Gamora as his daughter

553
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:58,809
but anyway after he kills everybody sees

554
00:23:58,809 --> 00:24:00,370
her and she's like is it did you do it

555
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:02,049
is it done and he's like yeah and she

556
00:24:02,049 --> 00:24:05,799
looks oh she looks kind of disapproving

557
00:24:05,799 --> 00:24:07,899
but yet she's like is it worth it how's

558
00:24:07,899 --> 00:24:09,460
it worth or what it kinda not really

559
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,080
happy well yeah like what did it cost

560
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:15,330
and something yeah it's it's on screen

561
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:19,749
externalized guilt and because of that

562
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:22,779
scene and him sort of and he explained

563
00:24:22,779 --> 00:24:24,429
what would you do you know the hair was

564
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:26,049
like what would you do anyway if you won

565
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:28,480
you know after you murdered half the

566
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,669
universe he's like I would sit in my

567
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:33,730
home and I would watch the sunset and I

568
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:35,950
would know that I did the right thing

569
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:37,629
and then I had the will to do it

570
00:24:37,629 --> 00:24:40,450
and and he does that at the end and and

571
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:42,279
he kind of led sound a little bit of a

572
00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:45,129
gratifying smile but I gotta believe

573
00:24:45,129 --> 00:24:47,350
that some part of him is a little

574
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:49,570
bittersweet and they might take that

575
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:52,059
element from the comic where when he

576
00:24:52,059 --> 00:24:55,179
wins he's a little bit regretful didn't

577
00:24:55,179 --> 00:24:57,100
he's got nothing to fight left and he

578
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:00,100
sort of lost his drive in his reason for

579
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:03,369
being and battling and this one it might

580
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:05,499
be his guilt that maybe tears him apart

581
00:25:05,499 --> 00:25:08,019
we might see more of this little girl

582
00:25:08,019 --> 00:25:11,499
Gamora you know really tear at him

583
00:25:11,499 --> 00:25:13,149
because he basically has to kill his own

584
00:25:13,149 --> 00:25:15,129
daughter to get the soul stone a soul

585
00:25:15,129 --> 00:25:19,090
for assault is what they say and red

586
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:21,519
skull and I know it was coming you know

587
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:25,119
red skull shows up in a cameo saying you

588
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:27,669
know because remember he left with the

589
00:25:27,669 --> 00:25:30,100
soul stone when he tried to touch it and

590
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:33,070
he ends up on this planet it says baby

591
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:34,899
basically tells him how to do it

592
00:25:34,899 --> 00:25:36,700
he's just the guide for the the stone

593
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:39,399
now and it was a little sad man seems

594
00:25:39,399 --> 00:25:40,690
there's nothing good Morgan do he's

595
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:42,999
literally takes her by damage well he's

596
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:45,340
crying I mean yeah we will bet yes he's

597
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,230
like he doesn't he's not evil

598
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:50,110
I mean he's his goals were very

599
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:51,580
different than everyone else's goals but

600
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:52,659
he's not doing it because he wants to be

601
00:25:52,659 --> 00:25:54,100
a jerk he's doing he thinks he's saving

602
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,400
right yeah which is what I like I know

603
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,300
really good bad guy now I'd say that the

604
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:03,240
only sort of I don't know if it's out of

605
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,910
place but we have one more cameo who is

606
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:07,100
it

607
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:12,180
we go and we forge a new weapon Peter

608
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:16,950
yeah Peter Dinklage is in the film he is

609
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:19,980
a dwarf I don't remember his name so I

610
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,420
don't know if he's actually the doors

611
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:24,540
that actually crafted the hammer from

612
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:27,480
God from North Norse mythology I didn't

613
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,920
catch his name

614
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,430
what did you think of his his character

615
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:36,780
yeah okay and you yeah he for me I don't

616
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:38,550
know I just saw him as Peter Dinklage

617
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:42,060
and maybe 15 feet tall yeah they they

618
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:46,380
made the dwarf massive and I I guess it

619
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,570
doesn't make sense to me because I had

620
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:51,870
that dwarves we're smaller but I guess

621
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:54,060
they're the implication is they are from

622
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,320
a different realm because if you're

623
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,820
talking about Norse mythology there's

624
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:59,070
nine worlds so they don't all have to be

625
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:02,670
the Asgardian size so yeah I don't know

626
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:03,240
I just

627
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,980
and in the mid his voice a little bit

628
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:08,670
lower in order to match the great size

629
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:11,370
and I don't know you just seem like I

630
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:13,620
couldn't see him I couldn't separate him

631
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:16,590
as Peter and and by mizzou is a dwarf

632
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:18,960
but he helps them forge that new weapon

633
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,990
so he's that he has a role in it we

634
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:23,940
don't know if he's alive or dead whether

635
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,880
he was one of the ones that passed away

636
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:29,160
turned to dust but there are two people

637
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:32,690
we didn't see we didn't see in this film

638
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:35,520
anybody know who was a hero that didn't

639
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,980
show up that has been getting mains on

640
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:40,950
the internet and no wonder he didn't

641
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:44,670
show up where the fuck was Hawk I know

642
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:45,900
they they specifically mentioned with

643
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:49,260
him out there oh I didn't hear that they

644
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,880
got a deal with the government and it

645
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,140
was too hard on their family lives he

646
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,610
has kids he used to can't be doing so oh

647
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:57,930
I thought they were talking about the

648
00:27:57,930 --> 00:28:01,110
leader or the old man an ant man the ant

649
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:03,450
man's boss no no no they were actually

650
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:05,610
talking about Hawkeye

651
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:07,800
and ant-man so high an entire time by

652
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:15,060
the defenders the defenders they see

653
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,340
that big-ass ship they start like

654
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:28,110
creeping into the bush so we we don't

655
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:33,420
see hop guy we don't see ant-man what is

656
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,610
your what is your problem with atom war

657
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:37,650
like I don't want so I don't want an

658
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:38,460
easy out

659
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,290
what would been that the easy out where

660
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:42,120
he shows up and just beats up thicknose

661
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,830
for no because Adam more like his super

662
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:45,570
powerful yeah like he's like a Superman

663
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:48,120
almost in the Marvel Universe he's not

664
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:52,080
quite a specter his name but he's not

665
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,720
versatile Sentinel and an inspector is

666
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,830
DC green with the hood but yeah so I I

667
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:00,840
do want to see him though I do but I

668
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,430
don't want him to be that they show up

669
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:04,620
and say oh I did it yeah everyone's

670
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:08,160
everyone's back everyone's cool yeah

671
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:13,650
yeah man it is night and day Joe why did

672
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:14,820
you have to bring that up

673
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:18,650
oh that's exact Justice League vs vs

674
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:21,720
Avengers infinity war you can clearly

675
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,690
tell who is the little kid in the room

676
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:27,390
and the one that's mimicking and and

677
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:30,510
it's just the shell the shell of its

678
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:34,170
great self because DC is great and it's

679
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:36,660
stories are great and you can see that

680
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:39,090
in the Disney Animation yeah yeah

681
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:40,950
totally good DC animation we watched

682
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:43,740
yesterday yeah which I still I still

683
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,690
like I probably love my raining a little

684
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:46,400
bit on it

685
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,440
after seeing this the truly good film

686
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:54,610
but but now I I didn't like Ninja Batman

687
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:57,620
but this one we can all agree a 10 out

688
00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:01,850
of 10 guys a moment in film it's a

689
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:03,860
moment in film whether you like it or

690
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:06,170
not it's a moment in move comic-book

691
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:09,050
movies and comic book movies are now a

692
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:11,660
big part of our movie going experience

693
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:15,710
yeah suck of James Cameron yeah and the

694
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:17,510
fact that it had the balls to kill this

695
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:21,470
many characters off and not be not do a

696
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:24,679
Superman you know dirt rising at the end

697
00:30:24,679 --> 00:30:26,480
they don't make any implication that

698
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,550
these guys are gonna come back in their

699
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:31,040
current forms and though they don't say

700
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:34,610
shit the credits fucking roll and I

701
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:37,700
loved it and so clap and thank you to

702
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:41,570
marvel and thank you to DC thank you to

703
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:44,900
Disney for for allowing them to do that

704
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:48,710
I do make these guys look a lot better

705
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:50,780
it's what they're doing right now but

706
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:53,360
please somebody from Marvel can can you

707
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,490
send some people over there help them

708
00:30:55,490 --> 00:31:03,340
out it's good for competition Joe

709
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:07,730
alright anyways so yeah we're probably

710
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:09,530
forgetting a lawn and we can discuss

711
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:11,270
lore and we can discuss the future of

712
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:13,850
the cinematic universe in our in our

713
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:16,550
follow up video in a week but I do want

714
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:18,260
to say that that I think this is the

715
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:20,750
perfect way to do it we're gonna get

716
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:22,880
another infinity war film and they

717
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,740
stopped calling it part 2 so it's

718
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:25,970
probably gonna be called something else

719
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:28,550
that continues this storyline obviously

720
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:32,059
and who is gonna come back it's great

721
00:31:32,059 --> 00:31:35,390
it's fantastic the speculation is all up

722
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:37,280
in the air because you could literally

723
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,830
do anything with this and if I was one

724
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:41,270
of the actors and I wanted to come back

725
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:43,520
a bit a little nervous you know my my

726
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:47,559
contract negotiations a little in the

727
00:31:47,559 --> 00:31:50,270
little and jeopardy well we'll see we'll

728
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:52,460
see but now a new team of arrows can

729
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:53,809
come we're gonna get Captain Marvel

730
00:31:53,809 --> 00:31:56,179
female superhero that's like a Superman

731
00:31:56,179 --> 00:31:58,820
I can't wait for that and ant-man and

732
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:04,309
wasps and Doctor Strange probably has a

733
00:32:04,309 --> 00:32:05,509
sequel up in here somewhere

734
00:32:05,509 --> 00:32:08,809
and then of course he's good no he

735
00:32:08,809 --> 00:32:12,440
didn't he didn't turn into dust oh shit

736
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:16,249
he did damn man I forgot about that no

737
00:32:16,249 --> 00:32:19,909
yeah I know mundane thing like yeah that

738
00:32:19,909 --> 00:32:21,379
was a shocker like I was like he's gonna

739
00:32:21,379 --> 00:32:23,299
survive so one thing we were talking

740
00:32:23,299 --> 00:32:24,320
about like you said that there was an

741
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,960
emotional there was people really upset

742
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,149
when he was gone by yeah though and so

743
00:32:29,149 --> 00:32:30,019
people are gonna have a different

744
00:32:30,019 --> 00:32:32,539
reaction so you may not have right I

745
00:32:32,539 --> 00:32:34,639
repaired myself because I was like I

746
00:32:34,639 --> 00:32:37,789
want everybody to die yeah and so it's

747
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,169
like there's some emotional moments for

748
00:32:39,169 --> 00:32:40,700
other people they're like no that's mine

749
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:46,490
that's my hero I want to be that guy why

750
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:48,409
is war machine around no one likes that

751
00:32:48,409 --> 00:32:52,999
guy I know Don I'm sorry you like Don

752
00:32:52,999 --> 00:32:55,249
know I was like what did he die he could

753
00:32:55,249 --> 00:32:57,200
have died so I know none of us like war

754
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,850
machine dong zhuo no he was actually

755
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:00,529
really some really big actually like the

756
00:33:00,529 --> 00:33:04,279
original actor Terrence E I really liked

757
00:33:04,279 --> 00:33:08,869
him I wonder why he I just - because we

758
00:33:08,869 --> 00:33:13,429
already paralyzed him he just I don't

759
00:33:13,429 --> 00:33:16,039
know he just seems out of place but god

760
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:18,139
damn man he had some great moments dude

761
00:33:18,139 --> 00:33:20,389
he had enough ain't not enough where I

762
00:33:20,389 --> 00:33:22,970
was look that's a fucking Thai war

763
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:27,309
machine may earns his place dude is he

764
00:33:27,309 --> 00:33:30,889
blowing shit up he does probably the

765
00:33:30,889 --> 00:33:33,289
second most damaged no the third because

766
00:33:33,289 --> 00:33:35,600
it's Thor and Scarlett Winchester those

767
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,029
are the ones you know who in terms of

768
00:33:38,029 --> 00:33:39,409
power level was a little bitch in this

769
00:33:39,409 --> 00:33:40,779
film

770
00:33:40,779 --> 00:33:44,059
they even show up Joe stop it with debry

771
00:33:44,059 --> 00:33:47,269
knows who was a bitch who has immense

772
00:33:47,269 --> 00:33:50,960
power but didn't really even show it yes

773
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,909
the whole game vision is getting this

774
00:33:52,909 --> 00:33:55,580
ass fucking knocked around yeah he's got

775
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:58,860
a power of an infinity because game

776
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,750
use it in the very beginning though he

777
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:04,470
is coming down fine even he'll fine

778
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:09,060
he's like but still amazing and the one

779
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:12,179
time he does that a fucking scepter can

780
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:16,169
block the got-dang infinity stone I

781
00:34:16,169 --> 00:34:19,830
don't profess oh I don't think so that

782
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:22,589
should the power of those stones should

783
00:34:22,589 --> 00:34:25,109
be enough to shatter any speck I thought

784
00:34:25,109 --> 00:34:27,270
they were maybe explain later but that

785
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:29,940
scepter can can contain the stone I

786
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,260
thought they were gonna explain what

787
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:34,409
nice this is a fucking random spear if

788
00:34:34,409 --> 00:34:35,940
you did that was the spear that was

789
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,560
specifically designed to remove the

790
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:40,109
stone from him remember okay it wasn't

791
00:34:40,109 --> 00:34:42,300
the same stone that Loki or the staff

792
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,429
had located use because it has that kind

793
00:34:44,429 --> 00:34:46,409
of same shit I was different oh yeah

794
00:34:46,409 --> 00:34:47,490
okay okay all right

795
00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:50,940
but yeah so so vision didn't really live

796
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:53,550
up to his sort of he was power level

797
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:56,480
with an infinity stone in his fucking

798
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,210
they just had a special weapon

799
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:01,530
apparently that caught him by surprise

800
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:08,040
he wasn't able to phase out yeah yeah

801
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,589
yeah that got me to that got me to I

802
00:35:10,589 --> 00:35:13,650
like cuz because they are continuing the

803
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:15,390
love story line between vision and

804
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:17,369
Scarlet Witch and they've escaped or

805
00:35:17,369 --> 00:35:20,250
there have a little you know sex are you

806
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:21,780
know I don't know in the in Scotland and

807
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,580
they want to be together and they think

808
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,230
about let's just get away yeah that's

809
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:25,770
what I meant

810
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:31,830
and say but there's extra sex yeah yeah

811
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:35,160
not in the movie but so they they were

812
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,349
thinking about just not being heroes

813
00:35:37,349 --> 00:35:39,330
anymore and just kind of doing their own

814
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:45,450
thing but yeah and I really always hoped

815
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:47,460
someone get this man a shield

816
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:49,290
I wanted to get him a shield but they

817
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:51,180
gave him this stupid little half fuckin

818
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:54,300
arm thing I'm like nah these two shields

819
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,849
and then also likes now give him a damn

820
00:35:56,849 --> 00:35:58,090
shield and he

821
00:35:58,090 --> 00:35:59,890
made it round and captain would have

822
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:02,710
done hell yeah actually dude I love that

823
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:05,850
scene where but they're like okay the

824
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:09,100
what are those spider beings or fucking

825
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,270
ravaging dogs

826
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:12,160
yeah space dogs come around the

827
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,420
perimeter and they're like fuck we can't

828
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:16,000
let them get to vision and there they're

829
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,550
breaking through so let's just charge so

830
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:20,170
that they'll come back to the center and

831
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:23,260
when they charge like everybody's riles

832
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:25,120
I just wanted to get up and start

833
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,650
running and it was awesome because you

834
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:29,440
saw the two guys who were the fastest

835
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,810
runners it was fucking Captain America

836
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:33,580
and Black Panther running at about the

837
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:35,350
same speed and I couldn't see well yeah

838
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:37,300
who was ahead and I was like oh my

839
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:40,960
goodness so oh fucking just man just

840
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,290
manly just you'd want to you want to go

841
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:46,150
out and battle with it you know and they

842
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:48,940
just start destroying people you

843
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,770
reminded me of the beginning singing

844
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:54,610
with Thor he's a man for your boy yeah

845
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:59,440
he's yeah I smell pirate angel Drac he

846
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,430
just has his speech his obviou he points

847
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:05,650
out the obvious is his thing and it is

848
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:08,950
the funniest shit I love it because it's

849
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:15,280
always unique obvious mess anyways he's

850
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,800
talking about Thor and fucking star-lord

851
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,230
sort of butting heads because he thinks

852
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:22,210
that Thor is trying to hit on Gamora but

853
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:25,120
he's not really and starlooks gonna get

854
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:33,070
in joke about his physique I did not

855
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:35,860
expect Chris Hemsworth to look as large

856
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:39,280
as Batista and and he looks as large as

857
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,540
the Jesus I don't know if that's just a

858
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:42,310
trick of the camera where they kind of

859
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:43,870
had him in front because I don't think

860
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:47,410
Chris Hemsworth is as big as Dave I mean

861
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:48,730
I think they're probably same height I

862
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:50,320
mean they're both very yeah but I think

863
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,380
he's a little bulkier but man God dang

864
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:56,800
great film it fully earns the 10 out of

865
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,370
10

866
00:37:57,370 --> 00:37:59,770
it's probably like a 9 out of 10 film

867
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:02,170
but the fact that they killed off the

868
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:04,330
characters and they don't apologize for

869
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:08,400
it is a moment in cinematic here

870
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,589
turian in comic book movie history that

871
00:38:10,589 --> 00:38:17,010
raises it 2.10 yeah alright guys thank

872
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:19,559
you so much for watching and we could

873
00:38:19,559 --> 00:38:22,079
discuss more of it leave your ideas of

874
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:24,720
comments down below we didn't talk a lot

875
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,339
about oh how did it compare to the

876
00:38:26,339 --> 00:38:28,020
comics and do we find it disappointing

877
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:31,319
versus the comics cuz me and Joe Jordan

878
00:38:31,319 --> 00:38:33,359
really I don't really remember it you

879
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:34,500
have read it

880
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,420
what's your opinion is it disappointing

881
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:40,230
or like you have to separate yourself

882
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:43,529
because so so many of the characters in

883
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:44,880
the stories leading up to this one have

884
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,770
veered so far off from the comics like

885
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:48,720
if I wanted to be the comics I would've

886
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,799
stopped watching these movies when they

887
00:38:49,799 --> 00:38:51,569
call the movie Civil War and it was that

888
00:38:51,569 --> 00:38:54,630
right because I was yeah yeah Civil War

889
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:57,150
was a tiny little dog so compared to

890
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:58,650
what it was in the car I can't do

891
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:02,420
everything exactly and honestly guys

892
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:04,559
superhero films are here to stay I'm

893
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:06,839
gonna be fucking 80 and we're gonna be

894
00:39:06,839 --> 00:39:08,910
watching a new Captain America you're

895
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:11,460
watching a new Ironman because here's

896
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:13,289
how I think the future of the thing is

897
00:39:13,289 --> 00:39:15,660
gonna go they're gonna have a few cameos

898
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:18,089
for these original characters as long as

899
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:20,700
they can until they just say fuck it and

900
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,529
reboot the whole thing I just want them

901
00:39:22,529 --> 00:39:24,510
to be done within five years or so but I

902
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:26,220
know they met on but another five years

903
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:27,390
well if they don't finish it what they

904
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:28,770
haven't liked in the queue right and

905
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:30,000
then once all those are done they're

906
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,470
like alright cool University and then no

907
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:33,779
more cameos from no original Captain

908
00:39:33,779 --> 00:39:35,910
America give it the original Tony Stark

909
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:38,039
know you've reboot the whole thing ten

910
00:39:38,039 --> 00:39:39,150
year break and then reboot the whole

911
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:42,420
thing I know that hey yeah break a damn

912
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:45,000
no superhero films from Marvel for ten

913
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,279
fucking years they can come by that time

914
00:39:47,279 --> 00:39:48,839
they'll have x-men back they'll be able

915
00:39:48,839 --> 00:39:50,819
to do fantastic for these ones no what

916
00:39:50,819 --> 00:39:52,529
I'm saying is is you want you know

917
00:39:52,529 --> 00:39:54,960
Supreme Court don't you fucking bring

918
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,349
this bad I want them to stay on I want

919
00:39:58,349 --> 00:40:00,660
em to be on and you cannot make me like

920
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:03,329
phantasm or that's a challenge to you to

921
00:40:03,329 --> 00:40:06,029
make me license back I am so excited

922
00:40:06,029 --> 00:40:08,130
about yes and I think that they'll take

923
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:11,460
breaks from franchises you know like

924
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:13,920
guardians of the galaxy Thor Iron Man

925
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,950
and put forth its

926
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:19,559
x-men you know Wolverine and the the

927
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:21,050
yellow and blue suit

928
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:24,200
I can't wait for that so that's probably

929
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,820
what will happen and then yeah there'll

930
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:27,890
be like a five year break for Thor or a

931
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:29,570
ten year break and then it'll come back

932
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:31,310
with like a matter and then I'll hate it

933
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:33,890
yeah probably because I'm like no that's

934
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:36,140
not my that's not my Thor yeah that's

935
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:38,600
not my Tony Stark I'm sorry but you're

936
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,640
gonna have this problem it's it's gonna

937
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,420
be a problem

938
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:43,310
ten years from now where there was no

939
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:46,220
face like I wanted Tony Stark to look at

940
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:48,770
Doctor Strange and talk because I'd like

941
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:50,210
to talk about being facial hair bros

942
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:53,630
yeah if they do have the wacky facial

943
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:55,460
hair I really wanted that too cuz I'm

944
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:57,350
not looking at their damn face right but

945
00:40:57,350 --> 00:40:59,690
they they jockey dab it same thing they

946
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:03,080
barbed each other yeah he's like does

947
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,330
this guy never stop talking and and he

948
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:06,950
said could you please stop blaming on

949
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:10,910
the fucking well of the cosmos I wanted

950
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:12,830
him to treat Tony Stark the way he

951
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:18,710
treated Thor in yeah that was the record

952
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:21,080
where he's just like constantly slamming

953
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,730
them into things and just and stuff just

954
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:25,370
just to be a jerk but so so Joe you

955
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:27,560
didn't notice anything like bullshit cuz

956
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,970
you're always the one that notices you

957
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:30,290
know what they could have just done this

958
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:32,180
and then it would have been over yeah

959
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:33,650
they could have just had Gilligan not

960
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:35,210
show up and they would rip the gut lid

961
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:36,830
off in the movie what okay so that's one

962
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:40,790
another one that I noticed is you know

963
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:42,680
how the fucking warlocks can literally

964
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:45,590
open up a realm to somewhere else they

965
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:48,440
do that to the big bruiser the hope of

966
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:52,370
the manty Hulk guy bad guy and like cut

967
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:54,320
his arm off oh damn that should be your

968
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,660
fucking opening move before you even let

969
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:59,360
these guys do their movies but then we'd

970
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:03,410
have no damn battle you know so they had
