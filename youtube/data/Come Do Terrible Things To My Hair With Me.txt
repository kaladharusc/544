1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:14,320
you know what I'm saying I asked on my

2
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,820
facebook what you guys wanted to see and

3
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,740
someone suggested actually that i

4
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:20,710
refresh my ends here and I've been

5
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:22,240
thinking about what to do with my hair

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,359
because seven months ago I dyed my hair

7
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:30,009
a semi-permanent navy blue color and

8
00:00:30,009 --> 00:00:32,739
this is the result of seven months of

9
00:00:32,739 --> 00:00:34,630
not touching it I think we can all agree

10
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:37,180
that the terms semi-permanent is

11
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:40,120
absolute bullshit this is here forever

12
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,519
so I was looking on YouTube for some

13
00:00:42,519 --> 00:00:44,559
ideas about what to do to the ends of my

14
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,809
hair and I came across like an entire

15
00:00:46,809 --> 00:00:49,719
genre of videos of people just getting

16
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:51,760
blue dye out of their hair which is

17
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,980
apparently thing and I came across this

18
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,710
channel called offbeat look and three

19
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:59,140
years ago she posted a video about how

20
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,870
if you crushed up vitamin C tablets and

21
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:03,609
mix it with shampoo and do that a couple

22
00:01:03,609 --> 00:01:06,040
times like massage it it apparently gets

23
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,900
some of the blue out without having to

24
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,460
read bleach it because I know you guys

25
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:11,260
want me to do insane things to my hair

26
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,270
but I've been growing it out and it's so

27
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:15,100
healthy and so nice and I'm really

28
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,140
enjoying it so I'm trying to just do

29
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,270
this thing where I let it go out like

30
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:21,340
any rational hairdresser I imagine would

31
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:23,170
be like chop this shit off and just

32
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:25,540
start over it's like having somebody on

33
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,220
you softball team that's not very good

34
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,710
but they're good 15 morale let's not cut

35
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:32,140
them let's keep them so it's like pretty

36
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,240
healthy but I don't want to bleach it

37
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,920
again and I don't want to cut it I just

38
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,620
want to like make it fun and fresh for

39
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,690
summer you know because it's it's very

40
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:43,330
pretty I like it I don't hate it but I

41
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:44,710
would like it to be like a little

42
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:46,660
fresher so I want to delve into a

43
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,400
territory that I've never been one I

44
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,350
want to try that vitamin C treatment

45
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,510
that she suggests it we crush these up

46
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:54,670
we mix it with shampoo we massage it and

47
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,890
then we see what happens then my plan a

48
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:00,670
is to I've never used a toner in my life

49
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:03,250
I am so excited at the idea that if I

50
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,020
got some of this blue out I could maybe

51
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,120
tone it into a color that was like a

52
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,069
silvery ash I think that's very

53
00:02:09,069 --> 00:02:10,450
ambitious I think it would be like a

54
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:12,630
green gray ash if we're being real

55
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:15,090
and then my plan B is to just throw some

56
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,520
purple on there which I read this bottle

57
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,660
and apparently I died that hair I did

58
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,960
that hair my brain no I was reading this

59
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,670
bottle and this apparently glows under

60
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,440
black light I don't have a black light

61
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,250
to test

62
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,750
what I think it would be cute though if

63
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,160
our hair matched each other this isn't

64
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,690
what I dyed your hair with but I mean

65
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:35,040
it's similar to what it looks like now

66
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,750
right if we had matching hair you're

67
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,280
expecting it look this good

68
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,010
expect disappointment so yeah I'm I'm

69
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:43,170
going to try and lift the blue see what

70
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:45,210
happens don't have high hopes for it I

71
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:46,710
think bleach is really the only thing to

72
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,690
get rid of this and then we'll try and

73
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,700
tone it and then if I hate it we'll dye

74
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,890
it purple so basically my hair is gonna

75
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:55,080
go through a lot today take a moment of

76
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,150
silence for the torture I'm about to put

77
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,970
my hair through your hair I'm so sorry

78
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:02,640
love Jenny the good thing about vitamin

79
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,890
C is that unlike bleach like it might

80
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:07,170
dry my hair out a lot which is okay but

81
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:08,850
it's not gonna damage it let's get

82
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:13,020
started beads seem like enough I'm just

83
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:27,020
gonna wrap it in this and just oh oh

84
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:37,910
it's already getting out my hair Beach

85
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:40,200
so apparently if you're gonna do with

86
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,850
this method just make sure you wrap it

87
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:46,650
in like 70,000 plastic bags okay there's

88
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:49,650
definitely still some like tablets in

89
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:54,900
there but I'll just oh so then she says

90
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,380
take some cheap shampoo so I got this

91
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:01,800
family sized bottle of swab but $2.99

92
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,500
each put it in here and girl you gonna

93
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:09,650
make yourself a beautiful pink

94
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:17,090
oh it was like a lot thicker

95
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,609
I fucked up somehow already whoops and

96
00:04:19,609 --> 00:04:21,019
then we're gonna leave this on for a

97
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:28,220
little while 30 minutes hi welcome to my

98
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,680
salon first just dip your hair in this

99
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,550
shit

100
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:36,530
wait a second holy shit look at the end

101
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:38,720
maybe it's just cuz they're covered in

102
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,419
white pills but like that looks like

103
00:04:41,419 --> 00:04:44,150
it's lifting on the ends already like

104
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,800
she did this treatment like a couple

105
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,419
times in a row you know and like let it

106
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:49,699
sit so I don't even know I just think

107
00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:51,229
it'll be really cool if I could get some

108
00:04:51,229 --> 00:04:53,330
of this out I could tone it into like a

109
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:55,340
silvery color so I think that'd look

110
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,710
pretty okay it's coming out of the ends

111
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:00,740
it really is yeah is this kind of like

112
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:03,139
lighting my brown hair very professional

113
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:08,830
way to do this this parts all blue I

114
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:12,289
feel disgusting but I am interested to

115
00:05:12,289 --> 00:05:14,360
see if this works at all I just can't

116
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,460
believe that I dyed my hair in navy blue

117
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:19,430
said been months ago and it's still in

118
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:19,820
here

119
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,680
some people do something called a bleach

120
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,590
wash where they're like bath bleach bath

121
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,080
where they mix like bleach with shampoo

122
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,789
or conditioner or something but they're

123
00:05:28,789 --> 00:05:30,139
like how to live color on your hair

124
00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:33,139
without bleach okay mix bleach shampoo

125
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:35,919
yeah but that's bleach I like this

126
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,840
experience all right so I think that I'm

127
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,970
just gonna like massage this and leave

128
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:43,039
this in for 30 minutes and then we'll

129
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,229
wash it and see how the first round wet

130
00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:47,960
if we want to do another round my pants

131
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,750
I got on my pants might be I smell like

132
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:55,760
B what a DIY hack no it's been about 30

133
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,919
minutes I've been rubbing it I can't

134
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:59,210
really tell there's so much weight stuff

135
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:00,800
in here I'm gonna rinse it and see what

136
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,360
it looks like and then we'll decide how

137
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,580
to proceed it doesn't really look like

138
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:07,880
it did a whole lot my hair down here

139
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:12,020
feels outrageously dry so dry and bad

140
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,810
like just real bad and I really don't

141
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:17,060
think it did like a whole ton but to be

142
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:17,960
fair the

143
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,310
girl and a lot of other people that have

144
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:21,199
used this say like you should do it more

145
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,419
than once so what do you say we double

146
00:06:23,419 --> 00:06:25,220
down and do it again so we'll do it

147
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,960
again just to say we gave it a fair shot

148
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,360
like you can't blame me for trying I see

149
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,800
somebody that's like crush up some

150
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,330
vitamin C pills and it'll get the blue

151
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:33,979
out of your hair like I'm here to try it

152
00:06:33,979 --> 00:06:45,590
I'm here for that yeah but bleach it

153
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:47,990
they'll probably just fall off I just I

154
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,699
didn't want to throw purple on here and

155
00:06:49,699 --> 00:06:51,110
then have it come out like the worst

156
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:54,979
color you've ever seen you know you're

157
00:06:54,979 --> 00:06:57,139
anticipating my failures that are you

158
00:06:57,139 --> 00:07:04,940
saying damn it Tom I think the lesson

159
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,349
that I've learned over the last seven

160
00:07:06,349 --> 00:07:08,000
months is that if you dye your hair and

161
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,979
navy blue it's just never coming out

162
00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:12,050
like did you notice any difference even

163
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:13,070
in the slightest

164
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:16,970
no don't squint at me okay it's helping

165
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:20,720
a little bit stop it's been about thirty

166
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,139
minutes again I can tell that my hair is

167
00:07:24,139 --> 00:07:28,370
just dry maybe better than bleach but

168
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:30,590
like it's real bad Finn you know what

169
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:31,180
I'm saying

170
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:34,430
feels like I might as well bleached it

171
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:39,440
the texture is disgusting just do all

172
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,469
that for oh if I tone it and it comes

173
00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:44,419
out but is that gonna be even worse to

174
00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:47,120
put the power on top of butt so what do

175
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,159
you think I should do I think you know

176
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:51,919
let's try the toner I've never used a

177
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,810
toner it's like a whole different world

178
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:59,780
I'm ready one part one part no more two

179
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:02,620
parts that was very scientific

180
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,660
I'm gonna do this you just slap it on

181
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,000
here Oh should I wear gloves it's too

182
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,740
late now just forget it

183
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:12,850
am i doing what even is toner even this

184
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:14,979
honestly might be like my worst hair

185
00:08:14,979 --> 00:08:17,740
video of like what not to do ever it's

186
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,680
so wet why is it so wet I don't get it I

187
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,570
can already tell that this isn't doing

188
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:23,650
anything at all

189
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:25,660
which means like if you have blue green

190
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:28,630
stuck in your hair your choice is to

191
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:31,060
bleach it or diet something else or cut

192
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:33,430
it off cuz none of this is working so

193
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,529
use enough of this I don't know how this

194
00:08:35,529 --> 00:08:39,640
work it's like a bottle of cologne like

195
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:47,200
what is it six years just set a timer

196
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:56,610
for six years four years Julian

197
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:59,680
it's been 30 minutes and I can tell

198
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,470
nothing is gonna happen look it's

199
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:04,930
exactly the same I've never spent this

200
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:07,180
much time doing absolutely nothing to my

201
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,190
hair it's like when you like do a braid

202
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:10,870
for like an hour and then either side

203
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:13,029
you hate it at the end it's like that

204
00:09:13,029 --> 00:09:15,550
times dead I'm gonna rinse this out it's

205
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:17,620
time to execute Plan B and I hope that

206
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,810
all of plan a didn't ruin Plan B but

207
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,610
where we gonna throw that purple in here

208
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:24,160
I need a fresh summer look and I'm not

209
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,930
gonna let this bullshit get in my way

210
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:35,770
wait did I just start the video or have

211
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:37,930
I been making it for hours look I

212
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:39,520
watched the Turner now isn't it a

213
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,290
shocking transformation

214
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:48,220
I feel sad aren't you glad that I had a

215
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,260
plan B rule number one of being a Virgo

216
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,089
is you always prepare for worst-case

217
00:09:52,089 --> 00:09:55,060
scenario all the time oh it says shampoo

218
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:58,830
hair then dry

219
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:03,420
that's your day that bit really it feels

220
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,100
worse than the time that I burned it

221
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,160
really yeah you want to feel it oh my

222
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,900
god this is the way you do hair right

223
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,150
you separate separate it into two large

224
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:14,520
sections and just do it I started off

225
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,900
this purple doesn't go in my hair I'm

226
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:19,170
going to lose it oh this doesn't look

227
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:21,510
like is dyeing my hair at all what even

228
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:24,180
is this what did i buy did I done fucked

229
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:24,690
up

230
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,280
it looks like it's just turning it blue

231
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:30,270
again it's turning blue it's literally

232
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:33,840
just darker blue wait bitch what I have

233
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,400
some hair fall do you want that honestly

234
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,920
yeah but you have extra purple a little

235
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,750
bit mix with conditioner is it cuz I

236
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,640
just toned it and it's not like sinking

237
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,410
in they're gonna use me as like a

238
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:45,720
tutorial in beauty school where they're

239
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,190
like this is what happens when you use a

240
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:51,300
toner before I color am i oh no but then

241
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,710
at least you will have help someone in

242
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:54,990
the making of this speech no I thought I

243
00:10:54,990 --> 00:11:01,220
was buying purple dye oh oh

244
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:04,860
just squirt some in there alright Julian

245
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,380
lent me some of his dye mixed with

246
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,630
conditioner so we can try to make this

247
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,910
work at least there's like die in here

248
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:17,220
always so oh oh that's better right

249
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,770
that's gonna be purple but there's like

250
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:21,660
so much stuff it's like not evenly

251
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,900
coating it oh oh be just a disaster

252
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:28,920
Beach to look cute yeah how did a fuckup

253
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,620
this bad I'd be really out here doing

254
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,650
dumb shit it's finally caught up to me

255
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:37,710
all of my dumb decisions I'm paying for

256
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:40,650
them I can't get any color to saturate

257
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:43,020
this strand why would i lighten it to do

258
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:45,480
this so Dom it's been a minute though

259
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,070
since my hair's been Purple's very

260
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:47,880
exciting

261
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,070
oh good there's like spots in here that

262
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:52,410
are just still blue oh it's gonna look

263
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:55,320
weird and janky

264
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,320
it looks like shit

265
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,450
something tells me my technique really

266
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:02,790
isn't gonna pay off this time this is

267
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:05,070
starting to look better or worse

268
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:07,650
really I guess just like the vitamins

269
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:09,780
theme gonna sit here and try and rub

270
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:13,170
this into these blonde bits hope I come

271
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:15,000
out with some sort of result that makes

272
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,030
any sense whatsoever I'm hoping I can

273
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,500
pull out a win all right

274
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,300
well I'll see you back in like 30

275
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,370
minutes and then the time it takes to

276
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:25,800
wash it out and dry it will see what I

277
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:31,980
done did I think it looks nice

278
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,320
you better boy because this is all I got

279
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,140
I like I love it I think that it looks

280
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,540
so much better than the super faded blue

281
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,340
green even though that was nice like to

282
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,860
a point there's definitely some parts in

283
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:47,940
here that my strategy of just creating

284
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,310
two parts and glop in some hair dye on

285
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:52,170
has done me dirty but you know I think

286
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:54,750
it's dimensional it's hair couture it's

287
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,850
one-of-a-kind couldn't be created even

288
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:59,040
if you tried Beach I like this color

289
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,510
because I know that this fades too

290
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:03,060
although I promise you even if this

291
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,490
washes out you will still see that

292
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:07,530
Bluegreen underneath here it's gonna

293
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:10,140
hang on until forever Beach so I think

294
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,270
it's really nice for summer to have like

295
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:15,330
a nice updated color on the bottom which

296
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:18,270
allows me to healthily grow out the rest

297
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:20,490
of my hair yes it looks like I did it

298
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:23,520
myself but you know what I'm free bitch

299
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,380
you don't have a black light but I am

300
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,060
curious if it would glow under a black

301
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,040
light at all I do love purple though I

302
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,050
think it's a very flattering color on

303
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:36,510
literally almost everyone the salon

304
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:39,750
always pulls it out the salon always

305
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:43,570
pulls it out

306
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:46,090
this is definitely a tutorial of what

307
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:48,220
not to do when you could very simply

308
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,710
just put some purple on your ends and I

309
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:52,600
still managed to fuck that up and the

310
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,640
whole entire beginning of this video is

311
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,320
like stuff that just doesn't need to

312
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:56,860
happen

313
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:59,980
Wow now we matter you jealous speech I'm

314
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,380
coming for you well it was almost a fail

315
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,030
and I was really worried and I was also

316
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:06,220
worried that between the toner and the

317
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,780
color like my hair was gonna start

318
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,930
falling off

319
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:13,570
yeah strongly focused please don't leave

320
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:15,520
me any comments about everything I did

321
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,370
wrong I already know and it's not like

322
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:20,530
I'm gonna learn my lesson but I hope you

323
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:22,330
guys like to watch me do this and I

324
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:24,370
honestly was incredibly curious if that

325
