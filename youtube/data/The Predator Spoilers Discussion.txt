1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:19,800
okay wow the movies stupid okay it's so

2
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,250
stupid

3
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,960
Oh Olivia okay the olivia munn no I

4
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,310
don't know where to begin

5
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:32,070
okay so the kid is bullied at school

6
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,829
because he's on the spectrum and he acts

7
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:37,710
weird but does he really act all that

8
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,239
weird I don't think so

9
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:41,190
but he's just super smart and so he

10
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,110
couldn't apparently understand predator

11
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,660
technology just by looking at it which

12
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,399
doesn't make any sense to me because the

13
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:49,289
Predators language you know it's written

14
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:51,000
in a specific way you'd need some kind

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,760
of decoder but fine the technology maybe

16
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,129
gives him the ability what about that

17
00:00:56,129 --> 00:00:58,379
predator to mass that had this mini

18
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:00,809
shoulder cannon on the on the predator

19
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:03,840
massive only that that knows exactly

20
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,939
where the enemies are

21
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:09,090
this little kid you know is Halloween

22
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,369
trick-or-treating now it's sounding like

23
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:13,049
an alien vs. predator bill

24
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:15,299
he's trick-or-treating with the predator

25
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:18,299
mask on some guy throws something at the

26
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:19,890
back of his head and makes him feel bad

27
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:21,990
and the little predator the helmet

28
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:24,479
shoulder cannon fires and kills the dude

29
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,270
the little boy killed more people in

30
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:29,869
this film than some of the military guys

31
00:01:29,869 --> 00:01:33,780
anyway when you see how stupid but yet

32
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,030
entertaining it is you know you want to

33
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,750
see that oh boy why is that in my

34
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,450
predator film Predators have human DNA

35
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:45,240
now that was that pissed me off I don't

36
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,619
know what they were trying to do there I

37
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:53,159
think that pissed me off so I don't know

38
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:56,040
they took the DNA in predator 2 or

39
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,920
sometimes babe rip some spines out and

40
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,500
they use the spinal fluid to take all

41
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,600
our strength to like go from little

42
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,600
predators

43
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,030
okay I took that completely wrong but no

44
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:08,860
no that makes sense that you know if

45
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,390
they're 13 foot tall they're doing

46
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:11,800
experiments they're trying to do a next

47
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,320
evolutionary sense and then it does make

48
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,940
sense of where they are predators and

49
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,130
they want to be the ultimate hunters

50
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:19,990
look the burners did create quite a

51
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:22,330
bunch of unfair technology to hunt

52
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:24,760
humans everything they fight is well

53
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,680
below their level at least on earth

54
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,870
maybe on other planets they fight much

55
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,790
stronger shit but this guy shows up with

56
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:33,190
XO army and I'm like holy fucking legs

57
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,570
like now you can't even shoot the

58
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:36,520
frederick sep 4 when he makes his head

59
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,959
vulnerable and that's why everybody

60
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:40,890
jumps on this guy or the plot dictates

61
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:43,300
exactly and that's when olivia munn

62
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,610
jumps on him and then fucking thomas

63
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:47,770
james jumps on and everybody's jumping

64
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:49,360
on him and I'm like I ain't going

65
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,940
nowhere near as my fucker we lick you

66
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:54,600
and you fall like 15 feet in the air so

67
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,970
alright so best a plot line that their

68
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,890
creditors are upgrading there's a

69
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:01,840
faction of predators it's like fuck this

70
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,239
we don't want to upgrade we don't really

71
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,220
know that no know that the other faction

72
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,200
of predators had nothing to do with the

73
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,459
DNA thing at all

74
00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:12,400
nothing this movie was about one of the

75
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,440
Predators wants to give us weapons to

76
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,150
fight the other predators I took but

77
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,680
that doesn't make any sense because

78
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,790
we're nothing

79
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:20,709
they give us he came to give us a gift

80
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:23,680
and then when he wakes up instead of

81
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,170
saying good for you and your predators

82
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:31,030
coming yeah he's like kills everybody as

83
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,980
if he's hunting if you wake up and

84
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,690
you've got guns pointing at you there's

85
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:37,930
nobody waiting guns oh yeah there were a

86
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:40,570
few guys then he's chained to a bed and

87
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:42,910
he's like wait a minute okay well what

88
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,530
about this the first thing he does when

89
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,150
his ship crash lands he's already

90
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,560
killing people in the jungle he's

91
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,140
killing the snipers team if he came to

92
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:53,019
bring them a weapons so just hit the

93
00:03:53,019 --> 00:03:54,790
predator seas of gonna quit what yeah

94
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:56,530
it's important that's why he didn't kill

95
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:57,970
Olivia Munn when she was naked I

96
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:00,250
understand that that's been a part of

97
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,540
better than or forever

98
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,850
what if he's coming to bring humans

99
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:06,310
weapon to fight other predators and he's

100
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,840
not gonna immediately say you I've got a

101
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,260
gun

102
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:11,709
fuck you he's giving you a gun it

103
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:16,269
doesn't make sense yes it was it makes

104
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:18,220
it so we have to talk about what happens

105
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:18,590
at the

106
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:20,840
what happens at the end I want a job I

107
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,730
want to tell them about this short jump

108
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:25,370
oh ok so the whole part of the movie is

109
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:27,169
there's little predator who's like

110
00:04:27,169 --> 00:04:28,910
normal size he's like eight feet tall

111
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:31,250
and little predator crash lands here and

112
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,360
he's escaping from all the other

113
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,250
predators who don't want him to give us

114
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,930
something that's in the pod and they

115
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:37,550
think it's a something that's gonna stop

116
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:39,650
global warming it could be technology it

117
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:42,530
could be anything and so big predator

118
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:44,090
kills a little predator for it calls him

119
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:46,250
a traitor and then at the very end when

120
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,870
they find the pod the big predator dies

121
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,150
everyone is happy and it opened the MU

122
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:52,160
is over but yeah it keeps going it

123
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,660
should have ended a really long time ago

124
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,690
and you're like oh god no this pod opens

125
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:59,240
up and I was like we were excited I was

126
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,530
like it could be something cool oh my

127
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:06,560
god is the fucking alien he's gonna

128
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:14,720
bring a and then they open the pod and

129
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,030
it turns out it's just a weapon that

130
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,680
turns you into something that looks like

131
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,090
a predator it's like an Iron Man it's a

132
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:22,550
predator suit it's a human predator suit

133
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:26,870
it's Iron Man predator oh my god it

134
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:30,110
attaches itself to a scientist and all

135
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:32,060
of a sudden his demeanor changes forget

136
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:38,780
it all be that's my see my new suit I

137
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:41,599
hope it comes in 42 long and lean oh god

138
00:05:41,599 --> 00:05:46,190
are you all got crit the creams levels

139
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,950
went to 11 don't Telegraph the movie

140
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:52,370
like that if you were gonna like the

141
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:54,620
ideas cool like okay I'm gonna I'm gonna

142
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,570
hunt predators now okay that idea is

143
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:58,669
cool but maybe instead use predator

144
00:05:58,669 --> 00:06:00,050
armor from a crash-land ship or

145
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,430
something like that and then and piece

146
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,050
it together maybe the predator helps you

147
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:04,340
out and you put it together and then you

148
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,050
go against it but no there's no fuckin

149
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:08,630
Iron Man suit it comes together exactly

150
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:11,060
like Iron Man and this film wants to be

151
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:12,860
Marvel they want to create the Marvel

152
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,310
Universe

153
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,860
every company Fox is trying don't you

154
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,450
see this now boys they're trying to

155
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:20,000
duplicate the Marvel Universe feeling

156
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,440
they're put of comedy and and and movie

157
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,440
potential so how do the two plot lines

158
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,659
connect right so they said that big

159
00:06:29,659 --> 00:06:31,849
pretty little boy is trying they once

160
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:34,879
little boys spine huh so big predators

161
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:36,289
so it turns out like why is he

162
00:06:36,289 --> 00:06:38,209
interested in the little boy because

163
00:06:38,209 --> 00:06:41,209
they think that autism like while autism

164
00:06:41,209 --> 00:06:42,919
is like the next step of human evolution

165
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:45,619
so it's not a defect it's actually

166
00:06:45,619 --> 00:06:48,349
everybody who's autistic is the next

167
00:06:48,349 --> 00:06:50,149
evolution of humans they're much smarter

168
00:06:50,149 --> 00:06:52,399
or much better than normal humans so

169
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:53,779
that's why the predator wants to take

170
00:06:53,779 --> 00:06:56,360
his autistic spine fluid and then go in

171
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,909
and breathe okay that's not why he's

172
00:06:58,909 --> 00:07:05,659
there yeah it is no he's there don't

173
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:07,219
make sense and so he just shows up in

174
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:10,269
there's a bonus he just like Oh

175
00:07:10,269 --> 00:07:13,219
obviously he's modified because he's so

176
00:07:13,219 --> 00:07:14,809
big so he's gonna go and modify his

177
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,999
other friends with autistic but he was

178
00:07:16,999 --> 00:07:18,289
traitor hunting he was a little kid

179
00:07:18,289 --> 00:07:20,689
hunting he brought the dogs to hunt

180
00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:22,519
Raider down I got you yeah but it was a

181
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:24,009
multi-mission you can have two midgets

182
00:07:24,009 --> 00:07:27,439
but the thing is so over everything you

183
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:30,199
just convenience convenience getting

184
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:32,959
people together you know they bring in

185
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:35,479
this scientist olivia munn who is

186
00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:37,909
apparently really smart and she's coming

187
00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:39,079
with all these really intelligent

188
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:41,509
conclusions they see how intelligent

189
00:07:41,509 --> 00:07:43,189
okay sorry the camera died there so

190
00:07:43,189 --> 00:07:46,129
olivia munn is giving helpful advice but

191
00:07:46,129 --> 00:07:48,050
yet they want to kill her yeah the

192
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,309
medical team wants to kill her for no

193
00:07:49,309 --> 00:07:50,719
reason you kill her and then they are

194
00:07:50,719 --> 00:07:52,129
your killer and then later on the mood

195
00:07:52,129 --> 00:07:54,649
yeah killer they try to put three finds

196
00:07:54,649 --> 00:07:56,269
in the film even though she's like the

197
00:07:56,269 --> 00:07:58,219
only one discovering like all these

198
00:07:58,219 --> 00:07:59,689
different things about them and Stubbs

199
00:07:59,689 --> 00:08:01,789
like what the fuck she has a microscope

200
00:08:01,789 --> 00:08:04,159
in a trailer home and she like figures

201
00:08:04,159 --> 00:08:06,829
out the there galactic plot she's like I

202
00:08:06,829 --> 00:08:08,809
looked at this stuff no it was stuff is

203
00:08:08,809 --> 00:08:11,300
the you know the DNA from everybody no

204
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,979
it was the kid that figured out all the

205
00:08:12,979 --> 00:08:14,300
galactic stuff because a little drawing

206
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,279
little maps I guess to the predator

207
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:18,409
homeworld and shit just from looking

208
00:08:18,409 --> 00:08:22,399
into the mask of the predator oh okay

209
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:25,939
so towards the end they have a firefight

210
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:27,949
at the ends where they confronting the

211
00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:30,139
scientists and they're all shooting and

212
00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:32,180
then the big bad predator shows up

213
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,159
starts murdering the team murdering

214
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,319
everybody then for no apparent reason it

215
00:08:36,319 --> 00:08:38,240
goes in the ship instead of finishing on

216
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,199
if everybody else

217
00:08:39,199 --> 00:08:41,930
- he's truck okay he's trying to destroy

218
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:43,639
the gift that he's trying to give to the

219
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:45,250
humans so he blows the ship

220
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,170
then goes out on a hunt okay I started

221
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:48,850
making a little bit of sense now right

222
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:50,770
no it was the very next thing that

223
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:53,770
happens makes absolutely no sense that

224
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:55,060
have been killing each other the entire

225
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:57,520
all right the predator goes you're on

226

260
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,370

261
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,230
cannons in that way and then it fires

262
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:37,450
and his head's gone he's like I got the

263
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:38,920
predator and then something you know

264
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,740
make some noise and yeah it was real

265
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:44,670

266
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:48,850

267
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:51,160

268
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,230

269
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:56,530
turns out that he's like alright I'm

270
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,450
gonna leave this planet now but our team

271
00:10:58,450 --> 00:10:58,930
isn't

272
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:00,910
with the big-ass predator they all run

273
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,860
and jump on the ship with no plan

274
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,769
whatsoever the loonies jump on the ship

275
00:11:05,769 --> 00:11:07,749
with no plants or with olivia munn in

276
00:11:07,749 --> 00:11:09,189
tow and she's shooting her grenade

277
00:11:09,189 --> 00:11:11,439
launcher and her and her small arms fire

278
00:11:11,439 --> 00:11:14,290
at the freakin when we've seen this this

279
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:15,639
predator ship could you know is

280
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:16,240
bulletproof

281
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,269
whatever then he activates his shield

282
00:11:19,269 --> 00:11:22,240
which rips one guy in half Norden his

283
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,790
legs okay he drops into the forest but

284
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,199
somehow everyone just assumes that he's

285
00:11:26,199 --> 00:11:32,679
dead thank anyways he goes under the

286
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:34,569
shield while his friend stays on top of

287
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:36,189
the shield and I never got that guy's

288
00:11:36,189 --> 00:11:38,980
name Nebraska Nebraska is right like

289
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,949
that I really like that actor and he was

290
00:11:41,949 --> 00:11:44,499
a serum saying some of these characters

291
00:11:44,499 --> 00:11:46,959
in the loonie teams were really fun and

292
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:50,199
I like this guy and he has a glorious

293
00:11:50,199 --> 00:11:53,079
death where he realizes he's fucked he's

294
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:54,639
on the outside of the shield and he's

295
00:11:54,639 --> 00:12:01,629
like just playing with EJ throws himself

296
00:12:01,629 --> 00:12:03,309
into the fucking engine while shooting

297
00:12:03,309 --> 00:12:05,649
it and that takes down the Predators so

298
00:12:05,649 --> 00:12:09,689
a glorious death and then he proceeds to

299
00:12:09,689 --> 00:12:13,089
fight this thirteen foot tall predator

300
00:12:13,089 --> 00:12:17,970
with Olivia Munn maybe a field work

301
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:25,209
jumps on is bad magic space magic know

302
00:12:25,209 --> 00:12:27,279
that you have open intake but you just

303
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,629
hope that no one no bad guys shoot

304
00:12:28,629 --> 00:12:43,449
inside your intake all right so the ship

305
00:12:43,449 --> 00:12:46,449
goes down and they have a drag-out fight

306
00:12:46,449 --> 00:12:48,429
which again action is good it was fun

307
00:12:48,429 --> 00:12:50,230
you know Olivia Munn jumps on his back

308
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:52,259
but she goes from this like teacher

309
00:12:52,259 --> 00:12:55,540
scientist thing to like a more

310
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,790
aggressive mercenary than all the other

311
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:00,040
mercenaries towards the end yeah Thomas

312
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,259
Jane jumps on his back and does this and

313
00:13:02,259 --> 00:13:04,120
you kind of leave Tom Shaye's look like

314
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,610
crazy and he has this glorious death and

315
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,740
you're like okay that's fine but when I

316
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,240
love your mom doesn't towards the end

317
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,220
it's like what was a very best wedding

318
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:14,230
this was halfway across the forest

319
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:16,600
because she like on Broadway is running

320
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,240
like to the spaceship and then there's

321
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,370
the space dog which doesn't make any

322
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:23,890
sense which they cut her dog yeah I got

323
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:26,380
they look like the dogs from

324
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,300
ghostbusters you blow with like the

325
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:34,270
weird dreads and no there are so many

326
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:36,940
the like the film just goes flip it at

327
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,620
the end it just says fuck it we do or

328
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,930
whatever that we want throws in the

329
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:44,350
kitchen sink and it is entertaining to

330
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:44,589
watch

331
00:13:44,589 --> 00:13:47,860
if only when your jaw is dropped in that

332
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,960
final scene where they realize the gift

333
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,029
that he's giving everybody is this human

334
00:13:52,029 --> 00:13:54,610
predator fuckin web and if it's such a

335
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:57,720
good weapon why didn't you like wear it

336
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,690
all right what is it specifically

337
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:03,700
engineered for humans I don't know I

338
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,410
said why wasn't he wearing that badass

339
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:10,440
predator killer suit to battle the movie

340
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,850
what's my favorite is at the very end of

341
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:14,040
the movie where they're like Oh

342
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,180
scientist man who are you and then the

343
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,440
kid has to look up and give him his

344
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,310
entire backstory because there's like oh

345
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:23,650
this is the world's leading cybernetics

346
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:25,029
expert and they that such and such as

347
00:14:25,029 --> 00:14:26,320
such it's like cybernetics it's like

348
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,529
like the t1000 yeah so they wrap it up

349
00:14:29,529 --> 00:14:32,410
nicely this this yes they wrap it up

350
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:37,120
what I'm being sarcastic

351
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,940
this unstable sniper is not the head of

352
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:43,779
the ExCom force for the human beings his

353
00:14:43,779 --> 00:14:47,260
son is the most smartest you know a

354
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:50,290
scientist on the team who actually works

355
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:51,810
there and has his own best a

356
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:55,029
seven-year-old kid this is gonna be so

357
00:14:55,029 --> 00:14:57,550
fun for people to tear apart but it is

358
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:03,640
entertaining oh I didn't I said 6 out of

359
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,400
10 it is slightly above average because

360
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,550
why it is got good action it's got

361
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:12,130
fascinating predator technology and lore

362
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:13,660
and they just say fuck it let's do

363
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,200
whatever it knew what it

364
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,660
to do it was being stupid it was being

365
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:20,120
crazy over-the-top on purpose in my

366
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,370
opinion I thought it was like whatever I

367
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:23,870
think I knew that they wanted to be this

368
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:26,420
doe yes do you know how many fucking

369
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,340
jokes are in this film how can you

370
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:30,890
literally not stop trying to crack a

371
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:33,590
joke and not think well this is nothing

372
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:36,260
like the Arnold though this is exactly

373
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,910
like the Arnold film they weren't saying

374
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:40,490
that they knew they could never fucking

375
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:42,170
live up to that film so they with the

376
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:44,150
complete opposite direction this

377
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:46,730
couldn't be any more different from the

378
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:48,610
Arnold film this is super serious

379
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:52,280
tension-filled just mono e mono I love

380
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,810
how the original printer just falls

381
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:56,150
apart everybody's dead and it's just

382
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:59,300
human on fuckin predator actions let's

383
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,370
do this right now and this film is like

384
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:05,440
jokes jokes jokes action action action

385
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:10,840
whatever garbage let's go explosions and

386
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,670
super super funny and then they jump the

387
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,470
shark at the end please give us more

388
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:17,330
money it's kind of thing go see the next

389
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:22,960
one yeah I do you guys want to see

390
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,130
sequel to this with that suit actually

391
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:35,660
being on me going for sequel uh I still

392
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:38,450
still after all these films they have

393
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:41,090
not done the predator storyline that I

394
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:43,310
think would work where the Predators

395
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:45,470
have to work together with the humans

396
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:50,120
against a bigger threat no well yes

397
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,730
you're right the original AVP but that

398
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:54,560
one fucking sucked because it was in a

399
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,810
pyramid and it wasn't it wasn't military

400
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:59,630
wasn't cool it was just some scientists

401
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,850
lady and well they already dig your idea

402
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:03,830
then I know they'll never go back to

403
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:05,990
like colonial Marines and fucking shit

404
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:07,970
like that because ABP fucked it all up

405
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:11,180
and do the AVP comics they'll never do

406
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:14,510
it because yeah so it is dumb schlock

407
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:17,660
and there are so many things like it's

408
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:18,860
gonna be so entertaining watching

409
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:21,589
youtube you know break down when this

410
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:24,410
film comes out on DVD it is gonna be so

411
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,360
much fun

412
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:36,320
Wow anything else with the scientist oh

413
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,920
yeah

414
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:41,160
Jake Busey so his father got killed by a

415
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,200
predator and now he gets to be in the

416
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,210
film he doesn't get a glorious death we

417
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:46,890
don't even get to see him get hurt I

418
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:48,600
think he shows up at the end when he's

419
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:53,130
already hurt they could still use him in

420
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:54,540
the next film I want to see him in the

421
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,370
next film if they do it I don't know

422
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:57,990
that this is gonna get a sequel I don't

423
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:00,930
know how well it's doing three I want to

424
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:03,180
see the predator license get driven into

425
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:07,170
the ground here we're kind of here but

426
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:19,140
it's just fun well what would have made

427
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,050
it better be easier cuz there were a lot

428
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:24,180
of moments in this film where I was like

429
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,220
oh you're onto something and we one of

430
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,690
my favorite parts about the first movie

431
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:30,750
was that it was almost silent for the

432
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:34,500
last third yeah and Joe there and it's

433
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,570
excellent because of that and they just

434
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:39,000
talk so damn much yes none of it made

435
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,710
any sense or was just the needless

436
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,960
exposition where we were learning about

437
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,150
things that didn't matter and they could

438
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:47,880
cut a lot of the little side things out

439
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:52,290
if they had they didn't need the be

440
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:54,360
autism as evolution thing at all if it

441
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,680
just been we need to stop them from

442
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,540
getting this weapon because if humanity

443
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,130
duplicates this then when ya do our

444
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:01,170
thing if it just focused on that and

445
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:02,280
have been a little bit more focused

446
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,080
tightened everything up a little bit and

447
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,520
hired so little kid plotline now

448
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,440
completely yeah hire someone like really

449
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,400
knows what they're doing and you'd have

450
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,260
the kid in the Halloween bullshit know

451
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,060
what it like so like what the mummy film

452
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,680
right where they remember the mummy

453
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,600
where the kid has the thing on his arm

454
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,880
it's locked on have it back like that's

455
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,380
why the kids important that predator

456
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,000
wants him because he needs that to get

457
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,440
off the planet and so you've involved

458
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,790
the kid he still gets to be there and do

459
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:26,250
all the things but I we don't need this

460
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,590
like unnecessary motive for the

461
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:29,730
Predators that they really didn't

462
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:31,380
resolve it all he needs a spinal fluid

463
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,910
so he wants a capture him alive

464
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:35,160
you've never done that they rip your

465
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,080
spine out and they take it as a trophy

466
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,410
and I wanted a little

467
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:43,320
information the info-dump all the time

468
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,330
with a lot of exposition in the predator

469
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:46,920
back store in the prayer home world and

470
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,480
what they're doing if it was more

471
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,400
mysterious and then maybe at the end you

472
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,370
kind of get a few lines on oh this is

473
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:55,290
why this big one came so there's no I

474
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:57,300
would totally rip off the kid character

475
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,400
and it would be the scientist and this

476
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,310
loony bin team and they this alien

477
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:05,400
crash-lands it's protecting something it

478
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,710
wakes up it feels threatened so it is

479
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:10,080
killing everybody but eventually it

480
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,630
fucking calms down and then that's when

481
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:14,970
the big one shows up you know and they

482
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:16,680
fight and they fight along with the

483
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,390
scientists so Olivia Munn gets to do

484
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:20,160
more the main character gets to do more

485
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,840
and the loonie team gets to do more

486
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,580
throughout the whole film without doing

487
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,900
that all this new kids getting bullied

488
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,520
all the where's the little kid oh I

489
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,050
gotta save my son on a football field

490
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:30,180
from the predator dogs with police cars

491
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,580
and this and that all that stuff gone

492
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,590
instead just put everybody in danger put

493
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:36,030
them in the jungle like they did or the

494
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,890
forest like they did here have these

495
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:40,500
badass show downs and then finally you

496
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,060
know the predator instead of being

497
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:44,940
completely obliterated by this new

498
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:47,190
predator he gets a walked over there was

499
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:49,530
no battle that trailer battle that was

500
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:51,300
the battle yeah they they punch each

501
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,650
other a couple times and then he just

502
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:54,510
punches he rips the guy's mask off and

503
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:56,430
he punches head-on and well he punches

504
00:20:56,430 --> 00:21:03,380
him in the face a couple times and until

505
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:06,780
the poster is of a predator holding a

506
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,340
predator school and your little predator

507
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,810
on predator they're gonna fucking fight

508
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,730
or something and and it the fight is

509
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:14,250
there in five seconds so if they would

510
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,380
have instead he would have escaped there

511
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,150
and the Predators helping them and the

512
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:19,740
Brenner realizes man these humans are

513
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,540
damn good fucking hunters they're damn

514
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:24,210
good soldiers or whatever and we though

515
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:26,520
we're different we're both working for a

516
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,380
cause I don't want my people to lose

517
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,570
their way on you guys or protecting your

518
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:32,160
planet and all this other bullshit and

519
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,310
then he heroically sacrifices himself

520
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:36,750
right would have been better and then

521
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,850
they realized man that guy that Pryor

522
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:41,340
was fucking sweet and but it's too bad

523
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,140
the gift he was trying to give us got

524
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,150
blown up and then they realize oh shit

525
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,830
it's not blowing up and they press the

526
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:49,470
button and there's this fucking suit and

527
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:51,389
then you cut it off there you don't

528
00:21:51,389 --> 00:21:53,279
stupid where the kid is a scientist he's

529
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:55,139
as his own fucking desk he's like the

530
00:21:55,139 --> 00:21:56,309
smartest guy in the world just

531
00:21:56,309 --> 00:21:58,349
introduced a scientist character in the

532
00:21:58,349 --> 00:21:59,969
last five minutes in the movie and then

533
00:21:59,969 --> 00:22:01,229
he's like oh I hope either heaven in my

534
00:22:01,229 --> 00:22:05,099
suit says you know that yes it is

535
00:22:05,099 --> 00:22:10,499
schlock I'm changing my ring cuz my

536
00:22:10,499 --> 00:22:12,119
movie was way better but of course all

537
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:13,889
movies are gonna be worse compared to

538
00:22:13,889 --> 00:22:15,659
the ones I can come up with in my head

539
00:22:15,659 --> 00:22:18,450
hire me Fox all right Shane black call

540
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:19,079
me please

541
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:23,429
all right this is one probably one of

542
00:22:23,429 --> 00:22:24,659
the longest ones we've done but it's

543
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:26,940
predator I love that shit to be good I'm

544
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,079
a big guy he's better than I expected

545
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:33,229
because my expectations were pretty low

546
00:22:33,229 --> 00:22:36,599
well all right guys sir we're missing a

547
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:39,450
lot Thomas Jane and what is it key and

548
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:43,109
Peele what's his name peel or Jordan I

549
00:22:43,109 --> 00:22:47,059
don't remember keegan-michael key and

550
00:22:47,059 --> 00:22:50,129
Thomas Jane badass characters and they

551
00:22:50,129 --> 00:22:52,559
have a badass death they try to take on

552
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,809
this predator themselves and I

553
00:22:54,809 --> 00:22:57,959
unfortunately had they flesh that was

554
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:58,950
something that could have flushed out

555
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:01,799
but we get like whispers about like that

556
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:03,749
one of them loses his mind and exit

557
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:06,509
friendly fires his own nope that's not

558
00:23:06,509 --> 00:23:08,279
yeah that was keegan-michael key blew up

559
00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:10,649
half of a convoy a friendly convoy and

560
00:23:10,649 --> 00:23:11,999
the only survivor in the convoy well

561
00:23:11,999 --> 00:23:13,619
Thomas Jane right and I think that

562
00:23:13,619 --> 00:23:16,349
trauma has bonded them I like them but

563
00:23:16,349 --> 00:23:18,629
they whispered that once in like when

564
00:23:18,629 --> 00:23:21,389
it's like man you guys are complaining

565
00:23:21,389 --> 00:23:23,549
about you get the whole exposition of

566
00:23:23,549 --> 00:23:24,839
their story they have to sit there and

567
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:26,399
talk for a paragraph and now you're

568
00:23:26,399 --> 00:23:28,320
saying well we know that because we got

569
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,379
we got 30 seconds of 500 characters that

570
00:23:31,379 --> 00:23:32,940
we didn't want and the one cool line

571
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,409
that we they're the thing that we get

572
00:23:34,409 --> 00:23:35,609
and we supposed to have like whistles be

573
00:23:35,609 --> 00:23:38,070
touched by their simultaneous death and

574
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:40,079
I didn't care because I got 30 seconds

575
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:41,579
of their backstory give me

576
00:23:41,579 --> 00:23:43,529
ignore all of the other ones all of the

577
00:23:43,529 --> 00:23:45,450
real bad ones that just give you more

578
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:47,219
fleshed out a little bit more and it

579
00:23:47,219 --> 00:23:50,039
means more I can agree with that all

580
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:51,869
right sweet I just wanted to mention

581
00:23:51,869 --> 00:23:53,459
them because they were good characters I

582
00:23:53,459 --> 00:23:55,469
thought that he was totally miscast and

583
00:23:55,469 --> 00:23:56,999
all of his jokes are can be completely

584
00:23:56,999 --> 00:23:59,549
out of place and they kind of work but

585
00:23:59,549 --> 00:24:02,039
it worked because at this point you

586
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:04,079
realize the movies not trying to be what

587
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:04,669
you wanted

588
00:24:04,669 --> 00:24:07,999
to be and is it entertaining yes but

589
00:24:07,999 --> 00:24:09,919
it's like maybe this could have worked

590
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:11,960
better if you used a whole new alien

591
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:15,220
race and we can get something brand-new

592
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,929
man it's really hard to make a predator

593
00:24:17,929 --> 00:24:19,730
film you really cannot live up to that

594
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:21,710
first one you can't put the predator in

595
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,210
the city it's hokey you can't put the

596
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:27,019
predator in suburbia it's hokey I did

597
00:24:27,019 --> 00:24:29,059
improve it thank you Joe you're my pie

598
00:24:29,059 --> 00:24:35,289
you're right we don't need a kid in it

599
00:24:35,289 --> 00:24:37,549
three out of ten see you guys on the

600
00:24:37,549 --> 00:24:44,630
next angry Joe show bye guys

601
00:24:44,630 --> 00:25:15,000
