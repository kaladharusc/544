00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:06,420
streamer bleeEEeEeh is latest example of twitch th0t harassment problem. ~owen wilson wow~

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:11,200
did they just use the T word? tWiTch? hAHA funny.. (omg im dying that was so funny L. O. L.)

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:19,180
i'm purposely censoring the name aAAaAnd the face of this individual because i'm not bringing this up as much as it is for her

4
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:21,010
more than it is for uh

5
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:23,800
this article and issue in general.

6
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,060
because daMN OLD MAN OH BAM, it's this article (can you even english?)

7
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:28,920
*burp*

8
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,290
PAINfully one-sided. FIRST of all,

9
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:38,880
hEEeAAaAh, this is the photo that they chose to represent this ~individual~

10
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:43,900
mEANWHILE any article from polygon they'll grab the ugliest (hey thats mean i like her outfit)

11
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:49,320
screenshot they can find from the video. it's hilarious. like what is this? (i agree) huh?

12
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,100
ALSO, if you google the name of this ~individual~ you get a wiiide

13
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:58,289
arrangement of diFFErEnt type of photographs.. but of course

14
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:05,140
there's nothing wrong with this, which is why they chose *THIS* picture *giggle* and not all these other ones. just pure coincidence.. ;)

15
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:11,950
now i knew this streamer before because of a clip that sort of went viral because she's an IRL streamer and

16
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:14,170
she was working out at the gym

17
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:17,189
but she was told by the staff that she can't work-

18
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:22,360
she can't have her camera face so that she shows other people in the background

19
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,930
but instead she just goes &quot;there's no camera&quot; *giggle* (wow genius)

20
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:32,540
*inhale* LET'S WATCH

21
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:45,890
you know stretching is DEFINITELY important. we got no problems with stretching. there's just a lot of stretching going on. (you like that kind of stuff dont you pewds?)

22
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:51,100
sorry, (its ok)  but if i cared about not being doxxed, i would not go to people saying where i live

23
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:57,260
in fact, i avoid saying where i live at most points, even if it's commonly known. anyway, the staff comes in

24
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:00,020
Girl: That's why I'm not filming anymore.

25
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:05,620
Girl: I don't have my camera set up today

26
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:09,800
Worker: ..Some people just keep complaining about it...

27
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,740
Girl: Who's complaining?

28
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,820
Girl: I don't have my camera set up, like

29
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,600
Are you saying I can't be at the gym?

30
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,020
Worker: No...

31
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,620
Girl: Yeah, I don't have my

32
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,900
Girl: No I'm just--

33
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,800
Girl: No I'm not filming I'm just skyping one of my trainers

34
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,790
*giggle* she doesn't have her camera. just like..

35
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:32,820
&quot;i'm not recording right now. okay?&quot; what are we watching this through then? (hmmmMMMMM)

36
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:37,040
i can see the camera right there on your left shoulder. [correction] right shoulder

37
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:44,209
she keeps saying &quot;i don't have my camera. i'm just skyping my trainer.&quot; trainers just sitting there like

38
00:02:44,209 --> 00:02:46,209
&quot;keep stretching. that's right.&quot; (you go girl)

39
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:49,579
Girl: Yeah I'm not filming though I'm just skyping one of my trainers

40
00:02:49,579 --> 00:02:55,359
Did she just say I'm skyping my trainers, is that what she calls her twitch audience? What's up my trainers?

41
00:02:55,359 --> 00:03:00,859
Thanks for watching me workout today

42
00:03:00,859 --> 00:03:04,639
My trainers

43
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:11,769
So anyway, he runs away he doesn't know how to face this you're not filming she's not filming everybody that's an important distinction here

44
00:03:11,769 --> 00:03:19,180
she's not filming at all live streaming is not the same as filming everyone knows that he's basically playing on the fact that

45
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:24,240
Technically, yes, live-streaming ioan isn't the same as recording, but they end effect is the same

46
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,600
Girl: Pretty sure..

47
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,040
Cuz I don't have a backpack, I don't have my tripod

48
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,500
I don't have my camera set up

49
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:36,400
She doesn't have the camera she says that at least a dozen time then guy number two shows up

50
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,080
Guy2: Hey, Excuse me, I know a lot of people have already about this

51
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:39,700
But..

52
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:43,720
In regards to the filming and the live-streaming

53
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,620
You're not allowed to do it

54
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,560
Girl:I'm not I don't have my camera

55
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,360
Guy2: You are lying

56
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,600
We have your account open

57
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,140
We know you're live here

58
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,420
Girl: But it doesn't record it.

59
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,600
Guy2: but you are live

60
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,920
It's still the same here

61
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,100
It's still the same deal.

62
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,780
You're on social media..

63
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:02,200
You have other people around you

64
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:09,700
The problem here is that other people are working out in the background all she has to do which the guy says as well is

65
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:14,340
Move to a wall where she doesn't show other people. It's a pretty reasonable

66
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,060
Request but she doesn't back down

67
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,400
Guy2: I know it's not the first time

68
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,920
Girl: Before it's been that I can't have my camera

69
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,420
Guy2: uh-huh

70
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,900
Girl: In here

71
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,220
Guy2: Have you never been told about the live-streaming?

72
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,640
Girl: No, they said don't have your camera in here

73
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,260
Girl: Before they said it's fine if it's more focused on me

74
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:38,500
Guy2: yes if it's only you or yourself and you're against a wall where nobody else is filmed, it's fine

75
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:42,640
Girl: So you want me to be up against a wall?

76
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:50,440
And then the big boss shows up Caitlin Caitlin

77
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,800
Girl2: Caitlin

78
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,300
Girl2: you gotta shut it off

79
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,160
Girl2: so either...

80
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,360
Girl2: you don't film here anymore or...

81
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:04,980
Girl: What is wrong with myself? I don't understand.

82
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,980
I think I'm being phone harassed

83
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,880
cuz it's like, I don't even have my camera here

84
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:14,210
Don't have my camera here. Oh, really?

85
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:21,140
Yeah, she pulls up the livestream. I don't have my camera. Oh, really?

86
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:24,440
Just move to a wall it's not that big a deal

87
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:30,420
Girl: ...feel uncomfortable though

88
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:33,500
Why did you say it was fine?

89
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:39,460
Girl2: what I said was...

90
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:42,060
Girl2: I've actually had your followers call and--

91
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:45,080
Girl: That's what I'm saying, I'm being phone harassed!

92
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:45,900
That's the thing.

93
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:51,690
That's the thing I'm being phone harassed other people are calling you guys so I'm being harassed

94
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:57,960
She's trying to divert to the fact that a lot of times when IRL streamers go to certain places

95
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:04,310
The people in watching the livestream will harass that place and keep calling in to annoy and get that person kicked out

96
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:11,960
So she's trying to make it seem like that's the problem when they mentioned it many times. Just don't film other people

97
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,240
Girl: I'm just gunna leave.

98
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:18,760
Girl: I'll go to a gym who is more understanding of their members careers

99
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,200
Girl: I'll just leave

100
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,320
Girl: I'm leaving the establishment

101
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,140
Girl: ok?

102
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,160
I get it. Sometimes you face confrontation

103
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,280
You don't want to admit that you're wrong. So you act like an idiot and this time it was on camera

104
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,210
It can happen to anyone

105
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:32,660
Okay

106
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:37,860
And it's not the end of the world, but most people know this streamer because of this clip and I find it interesting

107
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:42,200
How polygon doesn't mention this video anywhere in

108
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,960
This article obviously they don't have to mention it

109
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:51,930
But again Google any article of polygon with me in it, and you'll be damn sure

110
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:59,130
they'll bring up my entire history feed and most news articles do this why the different treatment now the main reason for

111
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:04,970
This polygon article isn't because of this clip. So it's again fine fine

112
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:06,690
I just find it interesting

113
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:10,530
the main reason for this article and the main reason she's getting harassed is because

114
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:16,830
Streamer bla-bla-bla has been hiding her marriage to keep donations rolling in from ell of the day again

115
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:23,130
Polygon's article never mentions this at least beyond a rumor about her being married

116
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:27,270
Therefore hinders that relationship because her audience who has built a relationship

117
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:33,950
with her feels cheated still she isn't responsible to disclose her relationship and then saying that you know

118
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:39,960
The people that harass her are just trolls and no feeling empowered to use degrading misogynistic

119
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,360
insults when situation like this occur and

120
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:48,530
Polygon and the stream are saying that people don't donate to me because they think it improves their chances with me in a in some

121
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,720
romantic way that's just isn't true

122
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:58,589
and I love this because not even polygons own commenters agrees with the state in the articles, which I I've never seen before

123
00:07:58,589 --> 00:08:03,229
The top one saying people in particular young men absolutely do this

124
00:08:03,229 --> 00:08:08,029
It's stupid and delusional and she can't be blamed for some of her fans misunderstanding

125
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,469
How real life relationships work

126
00:08:09,469 --> 00:08:15,199
But pretending it doesn't happen at all is a smidge disingenuous this leading to that

127
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:20,640
The comments was shut down on the article because it was just too much

128
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:24,280
Senior editor Ben Kuchera saying there hasn't been a single

129
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:32,550
Stand-alone common in here that doesn't focus on criticism of the victim. Not one. I'm shutting it down victim

130
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:41,130
Interesting choice of words as long as you're a victim you're not allowed to be criticized senior editor polygon everybody

131
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:48,329
Absolute Saint what a hero now. Don't get me wrong. I don't agree with people being harassed, but you think I've never gotten harassed?

132
00:08:48,329 --> 00:08:51,750
you think I will get the same treatment from polygon and

133
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:59,519
essentially this whole article is the same thing as the biased one that blatantly called me a sexist then ignore all the issues that

134
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,910
Alinity had done because as long as you're a victim

135
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:05,790
You're not allowed to be criticized and all the bad behavior gets brushed aside

136
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:12,019
She isn't responsible for the perceived relationship her subscribers have with her. I agree.

137
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:16,110
I agree with both statement from this article, but here's the thing

138
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:17,399
polygon is

139
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:19,110
deliberately bending the truth

140
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:24,180
just enough to get their argument across when really you look at the other side of things and

141
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,910
The whole thing falls apart and I'll demonstrate

142
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:31,550
People don't donate to me because they think it improves their chances with me in some romantic way

143
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:36,060
That doesn't mean she is required to disclose everything even if a rumor is true

144
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:42,230
She's entitled to play into a role on Twitch if she wishes I mean again, I kind of have to agree

145
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:44,940
She she doesn't have to tell people

146
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:49,380
That she is in a relationship and I don't necessarily believe that

147
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:55,920
Everyone that donates to this person does it because they hope to improve their romantic chances in some way like that's ridiculous

148
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:01,339
So it looks like they have a pretty strong argument here. Right? Well, here's the problem

149
00:10:01,339 --> 00:10:04,890
She didn't hide that she was in a relationship. She

150
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:08,060
Blatantly lied about not being an a relationship

151
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:16,520
And not just in a relationship. She's married, but then there's clips of her saying this

152
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:25,920
Girl: ...I'm single

153
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,200
So again, if she

154
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:35,340
Doesn't get donations because of romantic hopes from fans. Why does she lie about being married?

155
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,340
Feel free to answer me polygon

156
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:42,110
I would love to know what you have to say about that. If you don't want to tell people they earn in relationship

157
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:46,710
I'm absolutely fine with that and I would never assume that someone donates or

158
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:52,010
Whatever just because of some romantic way, but why would she lie about her marriage then?

159
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:59,820
I don't care if she shows up her body and she gets donation. That way I don't care if she lies to get more money

160
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,280
it's just walking the line of

161
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:07,320
Pretending that you don't know what you're up to and even lying saying no this doesn't happen at all

162
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:12,590
People don't donate because they hope some romantic chance with me. People know that's not true

163
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:16,620
Polygons commentators knows that's not true and they may not

164
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:22,700
Outright say it, but I know that they know it but sometimes they do say it

165
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:50,480
Sometimes they think the live stream is off when it isn't and certain things comes out like this female streamer

166
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:56,480
aAaaAAaHhh

167
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:02,779
The twitchy girls shriek of Terror

168
00:12:02,779 --> 00:12:05,630
Raynella

169
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:10,820
I got $40 from a couple weirdos, I just make so much money doing nothing

170
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:18,290
This brings me to my final points. Yes. We are at the end everybody but to the most important conclusion

171
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:20,529
Falling on and twitch are both gaming websites

172
00:12:20,529 --> 00:12:28,339
and in my opinion they are both hurting female streamers female gamers in particular because if they cared about female gamers they wouldn't

173
00:12:28,339 --> 00:12:32,449
Constantly brush aside all the issues and bad behavior

174
00:12:32,449 --> 00:12:35,990
They wouldn't constantly look away and give free passes

175
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:40,810
It's creating more and more uproar from the same people at the bottom line

176
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:45,829
It's hurting actual decent female streamers that just want to be taken seriously

177
00:12:45,829 --> 00:12:49,420
Because they get grouped in with these other eat streamers or whatever

178
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:52,149
You want to call them in my opinion not all of them?

179
00:12:52,149 --> 00:12:56,329
But a lot of them are just more interested in making a buck through parasocial

180
00:12:56,329 --> 00:13:04,940
relationships but if you criticize them you are a sexist just like vice called me blatantly in their headline and in my opinion

181
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:10,850
Media a lot of times care more about throwing labels around controlling

182
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:15,980
Ideas rather than fixing actual problems that they're pretending to be

183
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:22,610
Rioting for or fighting for and if you don't believe me take it from another twitch streamer

184
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:27,059
whatever she's doing it's whatever but I do feel like it's

185
00:13:27,059 --> 00:13:29,949
There's dreamers like who don't do those things

186
00:13:29,949 --> 00:13:38,499
because I get called like an e-girl or a thot and I feel like it's undeserving and I feel like

187
00:13:38,499 --> 00:13:41,379
People are like this now

188
00:13:41,379 --> 00:13:43,359
because of

189
00:13:43,359 --> 00:13:46,479
What's going on?

190
00:13:46,479 --> 00:13:51,179
Well, I don't know if that's true it's just how I feel

191
00:13:51,179 --> 00:13:52,749
or what i think

192
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:56,159
It for this video one like equals one copy strike

193
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:03,000
Hope you guys enjoyed I would love to hear your comments and thots on this. See you tomorrow
