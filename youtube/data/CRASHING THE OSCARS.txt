51
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:21,380
I'm the only one at the Oscars right now things having kicked off yet on the red

52
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,380
carpet

so we're just walking through checking things out

54
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:29,669
but if this is what it looks like before it starts i can only imagine what it

55
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:32,009
looks like after it starts

56
00:04:32,009 --> 00:04:35,139
look at this group

57
00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:36,600

64
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,900

65
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,900
Casey goes everywhere

66
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:08,270

67
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,340
to stand

68
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,830

69
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,900

95
00:06:55,330 --> 00:07:00,100
I had to see the seat at the academy thought that I was worthy of you

96
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,730

97
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:08,520
ok so it's totally cool this is the seat

98
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:12,629

104
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:53,510
honestly he was in the seat for like 10 minutes at the beginning of the show and

105
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:54,889
he's been gone over city

106
00:07:54,889 --> 00:08:00,770
k started coming to create this is what it looks like there

107
00:08:02,009 --> 00:08:04,420
the classroom videos

108
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,160
and

109
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,169
just a little

110
00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:10,949
I left the theater is getting boring in they're gonna go on a little bit like a

111
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:20,639
trouble finding mission soon i can dig up the show's happening right now and

112
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,319
live broadcast is happening now

113
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,939
these for some reason give us backstage at right here

114
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:31,540
you hear this

115
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:38,260
did you see all those oscars in America and he's an inspiration

116
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:50,570
briefly

117
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:56,260
markets like you've been talking to Ryan my favorite celebrity of the news right

118
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:56,770
here

119
00:08:56,770 --> 00:09:03,550
like when I'm having a very exciting to be saying this is something

120
00:09:05,089 --> 00:09:11,360
rolls backstage at the Oscars during the broadcast

121
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:14,790
I think we should go back

122
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:19,510
all right I feel up on the west we are

123
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:23,860
gone places that we should not have gone to like where the winners go

124
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:29,170
it's been fun but I feel a little bit like an interloper don't belong here so

125
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:31,870
i'm going to get out of here now go back to my seat

126
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,160
get away

127
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,790
this is the stage behind

128
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:38,610
I mean it's good fun but I'm gonna get out of here

129
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:41,610
this is the best actor

130
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,500
understanding comes out go

131
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:03,850
- he'll be in order

132
00:10:07,779 --> 00:10:10,779
yeah

133
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:25,970
let us not take this planet for granted

134
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:28,970
I do not take tonight

135
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
official airline that can be emotional George

136
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,550
and that's it

137
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:48,620
oscars are over that they could bring him so he and projection is the hard

138
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:51,620
part by

139
00:10:53,860 --> 00:11:02,230
yeah
