00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:33,920
got approved
 
(NOOOOOO)

EveRyOnE press f for european union

18
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,980
what did article 13 say?

19
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:40,720
well, people were saying:

20
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,760
that now you can't upload footage

21
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,600
if you go in a game match

22
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,760
you can't upload footage of MEMeS

23
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:47,580
okay :(

24
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,180
they will restrict content in the european union

25
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:51,120
for everyoNE

26
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,080
for who uploads and whatever you can access

27
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,460
there will be a

30
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,600
YEA LET'S ADD THAT

31
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,660
have we not suffered
ENOUGH?

32
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:03,620
alright?

33
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:05,060
we dealt with Ajit Pai

34
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,600
WE DONT NEED
ANYTHING (rip table)
MORE! (rip)

35
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,960
SO what really article 13 means hasn't really been clear

36
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,340
until now that youtube's cEO Susan Wojcicki

37
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:16,280
spoke out in a blog post published a few days ago

38
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,720
and it doesn't look good, it looks like

39
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,600
&quot;I'll be moving to India, and you as well&quot;

40
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,580
if it is what she's saying...

41
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:29,320
for those that don't know article 13 is a legislation crated by the EU parliament

42
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,940
with the intent to protect copyright for everyone

43
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:35,240
and protect your content online.

44
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,160
it has a good intent, but the way it's written

45
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:42,180
It threatened anyone uploading on major platforms

46
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,240
and people accessing content on these platforms

47
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:45,840
Basically

48
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,340
Any content you don't own 100%

49
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,140
You will not be able to upload

50
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,720
This video for example

51
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,940
Has already broken that law

52
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:54,440
so

53
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,620
bye pew news

54
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,400
bye

55
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,100
(pop)

56
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,720
This is so sad, I'm gonna be out of work soon

57
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:03,180
now this passed in September, and it is very confusing,

58
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,440
I'm not gonna lie

59
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,000
so, we get these crazy articles

60
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,180
saying that

61
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,780
the man behind EU's copyright law

62
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,420
is surprised by what's in the proposal

63
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:14,280
unaware of what exactly he voted for

64
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,020
to be clear

65
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,000
he knows what he's voting for

66
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,100
the problem is that people are interpreting what the law means differently

67
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,460
this is what I think

68
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:24,740
but what Susan Wojcicki said in the blog post

69
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:25,340
is that

70
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,340
they support the goals of article 13

71
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,340
but they say that the parliaments

72
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,340
approach to it is unrealistic

73
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:34,140
and that uh copyright holders

74
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,800
often disagree on who owns the content

75
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,600
and YouTube cant really take responsibility for that

76
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,000
So they're just not gonna host the content

77
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,040
as an example

78
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,180
They bring up

79
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:45,780
DESPACITO

80
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,400
oh no

81
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,320
What am i gonna do?

82
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,600
Without despacito

83
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,320
Because apparently

84
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:50,820
It's their song

85
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:51,740
I didn't know contains

86
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,860
Multiple copyright

87
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,060
maybe it has samples in it

88
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:54,860
I don't know

89
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:55,920
they're basically saying that

90
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,860
no company would

91
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:57,960
take this financial risk

92
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,480
It just woudn't be

93
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,340
worth for youtube

94
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,700
to do host this type of content

95
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,360
so they would just block it

96
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,740
YouTube said that they've had taken steps already to

97
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,920
address copyright infringement

98
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,400
&quot;Content ID provides the best solution&quot;

99
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,440
and i can't believe

100
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:10,980
I supported

101
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:11,700
Content ID

102
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,320
because it's God dam awful

103
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,620
I mean

104
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,040
I made a cover of Despacito

105
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,980
and I got a copyright strike

106
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,120
so it's already pretty dam bad

107
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,000
like it was 20 second of a video

108
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,460
that i lost all the revenue on

109
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:26,600
it was a ten minute video that had nothing to do with Despacito

110
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,680
but that's how content ID works

111
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,320
I can't imagine it being worse than that

112
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,730
{laugh}

113
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:38,470
clarify sort of some of the things that
Susan mentioned and they're saying that

114
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:44,530
YouTube would be forced to block
millions of videos existing and new ones

115
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:48,310
in the European Union it would
drastically limit the content that one

116
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:52,690
can upload to the platform in Europe so
basically they're saying when this rule

117
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:56,080
passes we're just gonna block the
content so it's some pretty scary and

118
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,310
dire consequences it's not just for
people uploading is also people watching

119
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:04,150
it's really weird I was looking around
and I saw a lot of Artie's actually

120
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:09,280
support article 13 you have James Blunt
apparently my name is James Blunt I've

121
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,310
been so lucky to be able to make music
but the next generation of artists

122
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:15,810
coming through need to get a better deal
when their music is used online I

123
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:19,780
believe we need a world where the effort
and creativity that goes into making

124
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:24,940
music is rewarded fairly that's why the
proposals in Europe to install online

125
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,680
services
get licenses for the music they use are

126
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,190
so important to performers and
songwriters who are trying to make a

127
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:35,720
living and build a career in music what
are you talking about like can you

128
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:40,610
explain what the problem is what is the
problem is Dean blunt not earning money

129
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:44,600
of his music like what is the problem
someone explain to me what is the

130
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,950
problem that so desperately needs to be
fixed for creators even have people like

131
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:52,970
Paul McCartney signing a letter an open
letter to the European Parliament saying

132
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:57,170
not going against article 13 saying
endorsing it saying that music and

133
00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:01,430
culture matter they are heart and soul
that they just don't happen they demand

134
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:04,970
the hard work of people what are you
talking about what's the issue

135
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:10,220
what is article 13 solving if it's so
important at least that message should

136
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:14,480
be clear you can look at frequently
asked questions on on their website it

137
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:19,400
doesn't answer this question at least
for me it's just very vaguely describing

138
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:24,380
nothing more cross-border access for
citizens to copyright protected content

139
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:27,470
online
okay cool what does that mean you need

140
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:32,270
to be more specific fair rules of the
game for a better functioning copyright

141
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:37,370
marketplaces what game what are you
talking about which stimulates creation

142
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:42,920
of high quality content how it's the
Commission banning minions

143
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:49,250
some good old Mami's the Commission is
not banning Mami's oh oh characters or

144
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:54,590
any reuse of content allowed under
exceptions or limitation to copyright so

145
00:05:54,590 --> 00:06:00,530
basically characters parody and pastiche
are protected thank you you for defining

146
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:05,180
memes for everyone
good job it's all characters and parody

147
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:12,890
and pastiche that's it I can't wait for
all the pets teach in characters I don't

148
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:18,500
trust you Parliament to define what a
meme is I just don't I don't trust

149
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:24,410
anyone over 50 to tell me what's the
best for the internet ecosystem okay the

150
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:31,040
problem I and the thing that worries me
is that as an example this happened in

151
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:36,590
Spain I think a few years ago where I
don't know if this is necessarily true I

152
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,569
should probably shouldn't
talk about it but people were saying

153
00:06:38,569 --> 00:06:43,309
that an article similar to article 11
which is also very bad was introduced

154
00:06:43,309 --> 00:06:47,719
into Spain and it said that Google had
to pay for a new segregation but Google

155
00:06:47,719 --> 00:06:52,159
just decided to shut down Google News in
Spain so if you live in Spain you can't

156
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:56,029
use Google News because of this law that
was added and it worries me because I

157
00:06:56,029 --> 00:07:00,889
think they're just gonna do the same
thing now instead of figuring out

158
00:07:00,889 --> 00:07:05,719
whatever it is because clearly wants you
to do something and they're saying well

159
00:07:05,719 --> 00:07:09,319
we're already doing and what you're
asking for is just enough that we can

160
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:14,149
take responsibility so we're just gonna
shut down the whole thing that's how I

161
00:07:14,149 --> 00:07:19,009
can best interpret this mess so EU is
saying hey what we're proposing isn't

162
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:22,909
that bad and Google's saying yeah it is
and you give us no choice so we're just

163
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:27,349
gonna have to nuke everything so it is
actually in that regard deeply

164
00:07:27,349 --> 00:07:33,529
concerning to see where this is gonna go
I guess I'm gonna move to India maybe

165
00:07:33,529 --> 00:07:39,439
I'll start a music channel next news
okay all right that was boring I get it

166
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:42,829
but let's move on to something more fun
something I really wanted to talk about

167
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:49,699
last week the Diablo immortal press
conference yeah let's watch it yah blow

168
00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:58,819
has brought millions of players around
the world together to slay demons yeah I

169
00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:03,049
love sling demon whoa one of those I
think what do they look like they

170
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:08,779
increasingly connected one our mobile
devices keep us closer than ever

171
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:13,669
through our friends family why is he
talking about phones why is the man

172
00:08:13,669 --> 00:08:21,909
talking about phones so we knew we want
to use mobile devices as the platform

173
00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:29,569
for a new Diablo game because nothing
brings a family together like slaying

174
00:08:29,569 --> 00:08:42,379
demons Jesus Christ we are so excited
about this game now I know so is the

175
00:08:42,379 --> 00:08:48,740
audience this legendary PC title that
had diehard fans for years people pay I

176
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,690
don't know how much they pay hundreds of
dollars

177
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:53,990
probably to go to this press conference
where they say we're gonna announce

178
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:59,870
something new and exciting it's a mobile
phone game a cellular device thing

179
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:05,560
because you use that for your loved ones
oh that's why ok it's not because China

180
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:10,070
the mobile market in China is just
bigger than ever and you'll learn a ton

181
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:14,990
of money from doing that the best part
about this is that they had a Q&amp;A

182
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:19,820
afterwards and the reaction is a
beautiful hug just was wondering is this

183
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:31,700
an out of season April Fool's joke

184
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:41,870
blow experience on mobile no it's a game
that we're doing because we like

185
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:46,610
connecting people and no other reason at
all we're just like connecting people

186
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:51,620
it's all about connecting people
everybody will get to play everyone gets

187
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:56,510
to play wait there's enough there's
another thing that I love look at this

188
00:09:56,510 --> 00:10:02,450
dude look at these dude coming up before
absolute legend can you imagine if he

189
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:10,790
were that damn that would be the best
marketing of all time see I actually

190
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:13,640
asked the question that you were
supposed to ask because they always

191
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,760
screen you before they're like hey what
question do you want to ask him oh yeah

192
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,070
I want to ask him about the difficulty
in the game that's probably where that

193
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:25,280
guy in the back did and then he went
what the fuck is there any plans to make

194
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:33,770
this strictly mobile forever
are there any yeah this the current plan

195
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:40,910
is to be on mobile both Android and iOS
we don't have any plans at the moment

196
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:46,820
and like how he says it like it's a
breakup like are we like done for real

197
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:52,510
or is just like I think it clean mobile

198
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:58,400
dominoes even made an ad just for this
this is not an out of season April

199
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:02,880
Fool's joke you will get a treasure
chest when you purchase our pizzas

200
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:08,250
is Christ the desperation you of course
have people with the best take on this

201
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:13,830
ever April Fool's joke oh sit your
fucking ass down and people are

202
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:17,430
applauding in the audience you're all
fuckin babies yeah you do applauding

203
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:21,630
you're all babies you're rude first of
all yeah but you're all fucking babies

204
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:25,710
little little five minutes of area'd
fame and you're in your fucking video

205
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:31,770
it's it's disgusting
yeah and now you're yeah you dude is

206
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:35,700
that what we want when we want it sex
grow up it's so gross

207
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:45,300
it's grow up so gross shut up kids we
relaxed up shut the up children shut up

208
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:49,410
I get that it's so easy to just point to
all these fans and be like oh just grow

209
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:54,120
up it's just a game oh you're not you if
you don't like it just don't play it but

210
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:58,850
it's like they announced this thing it's
for fans to be excited that's what these

211
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:03,510
conferences are about it's for fan
excitement if they wanted to make a bone

212
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:06,870
mobile game just to earn a bunch of
money just announce it somewhere else

213
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:11,640
this I know that's where the other like
tech conferences or something like that

214
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:15,960
this is a bad move I'm sure the game is
not that bad but it's clearly not what

215
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:20,130
people want and if they're making a
Diablo title for title anyway just funny

216
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:25,380
it's just funny seeing seeing all this I
don't know it's probably just me I feel

217
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:28,170
like it's one of those things where Brad
is watching this edit and he goes this

218
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:30,960
is really not that interesting Felix
okay I'll move on

219
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:42,959
Oh actually speaking of Blizzard you
guys see this so funny

220
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:50,649
epic games one announcer epic games one
developer of the year publisher of the

221
00:12:50,649 --> 00:13:22,959
year Wow why would you do that digi why
you don't stupid youtubers I love it

222
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:27,190
okay let's move on something more
interesting Washington Post decided that

223
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:32,680
apparently that there's one post too
many good joke Felix uh post Malone is a

224
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:37,600
perfect pop star for this American
moment that's not a compliment post

225
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:44,500
Malone you think you know but you had no
I dear he is literally Satan let's see

226
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:48,220
what's wrong with poach Malone you might
know post Malone as the SoundCloud

227
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:52,779
rapper who went triple platinum for his
debut track white Iverson you might know

228
00:13:52,779 --> 00:13:57,339
him as the genre-bending artist
combining country grunge hip-hop and

229
00:13:57,339 --> 00:14:01,089
just about everything else or you may
not know him at all

230
00:14:01,089 --> 00:14:08,770
but you should Malone is huge I like how
they had this kind of music where have I

231
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:16,450
heard that type of music before just
makes anything automatically like they

232
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:20,470
were about to reveal the biggest thing
ever does album stony beat out Michael

233
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:25,209
Jackson's Thriller for most weeks and
top 10 on the top R&amp;B hip-hop albums

234
00:14:25,209 --> 00:14:29,890
chart this is a thing the media does or
people in general I would say they love

235
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:35,170
to overplay your influence when it's
convenient and under play it at any

236
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:40,870
point Ellis so if anyone messes up
they'll go like oh PD PI said this to 70

237
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:44,200
million people I know I'm making this
about me but this is an example when the

238
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:48,399
video may be guess like 4 million views
but 70 million people I imagine just the

239
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,360
negative impact that we can't ignore
this so they're saying that he's bigger

240
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,170
than Michael Jackson Thriller which is
not the album is still the best

241
00:14:56,170 --> 00:15:00,339
selling album of all time like nothing
has changed he's not even near it so

242
00:15:00,339 --> 00:15:05,470
whatever barn Austen Richard post he
became post Malone the same way Donald

243
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:09,730
Glover became childish gambino through a
rap name generator execs at his record

244
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:14,860
company Republic Records have described
Malone as the Donald Trump of hip hop oh

245
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:19,720
my god he's literally Donald Trump yes
because he said if you're looking to

246
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:24,250
think about life don't listen to hip-hop
no how could you say that my life is

247
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:29,589
ruined post Malone his music one of the
shallowest bastardization of rap to date

248
00:15:29,589 --> 00:15:35,139
and I don't say that lightly Washington
Post published this these this whole

249
00:15:35,139 --> 00:15:40,600
article it's not bad but it's written
like a blog post hate piece I mean I get

250
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,709
it you don't like something that's
popular I can't under percent you know I

251
00:15:44,709 --> 00:15:50,649
feel that okay but why is Washington
Post posing this it's so cringy and

252
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:54,850
trying to steer it like he's connected
with Donald Trump somewhere and that his

253
00:15:54,850 --> 00:16:00,699
influence is somehow corresponding it's
this bizarre just following him online

254
00:16:00,699 --> 00:16:05,470
he seems like such a sweetheart like why
his post Washington Post posting about

255
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:09,850
post Malone that was a weird sentence it
talks about how shallow his lyrics are

256
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:15,670
and how dumb and young his fans are and
how bad his performances are and I get

257
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:20,829
it if you don't like him and to be fair
any music on the top charts is usually

258
00:16:20,829 --> 00:16:25,600
pretty damn stupid okay we're why
because it appeals to mass audience I

259
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,050
mean it's always been like that pop
music has always been shallow it's

260
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:32,110
always been dumb and that's what people
want you're just opening your eyes to

261
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:36,760
that now it just sounds like another
example of old people or the older

262
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:41,019
generation not understanding the younger
and this has always been the case but

263
00:16:41,019 --> 00:16:47,230
seriously questioning constantly these
big media companies for posting articles

264
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:52,360
like things are they so desperate for
clicks and views that the only way they

265
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:58,480
can resort to is just public character
assassination pieces it's ridiculous

266
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,230
don't get me wrong I actually agreed
with a lot of points on the article I'm

267
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:08,230
not saying it's it's bad in itself but I
think going after posed and that the mix

268
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:13,189
we politics is
pathetic last but last news okay we

269
00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:17,839
finally made it to the end superwoman
lily sings to take a break from YouTube

270
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:23,120
that is a weird title another one of
those BBC even reached out to me wanted

271
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,390
me to comment about mental health
because I've talked about it I'm getting

272
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:31,070
a little annoyed by it I'm not gonna lie
it's like shut up shut up children just

273
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:35,390
take a break one thing I've learned is
just take a break if you need a break

274
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:40,100
just take a break YouTube themself even
confirm this myth saying that that is

275
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,549
not true if that is somehow if you take
a break that will hurt your channel

276
00:17:43,549 --> 00:17:48,380
according to an analytics and statistic
that's just simply not the case if you

277
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:52,910
need to take a break just take a break
and I think at least what I've learned

278
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:58,040
is that if you post a video that you are
taking a break you make this big thing

279
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:02,870
about it then you're not solving the
problem that you have and this might be

280
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:07,040
hard to understand but youtubers thrive
on these things

281
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:11,990
Lilly sings she's been doing YouTube for
awhile she knows how it works she knows

282
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:16,250
if she makes a video saying I'm gonna
take a break it would lead to articles

283
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:20,150
like this it would lead to more
attention and that's the reason why she

284
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:24,110
wanted to take a break to begin with
that probably her channel isn't doing as

285
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:29,120
well and probably she's not happy with
what she's making so what's the best way

286
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,620
to get people's attention well a big
announcement it was something that isn't

287
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:37,309
clickbait or is actually real I don't
want to take a break there's many

288
00:18:37,309 --> 00:18:41,650
reasons Harrison for most my mental
health I'll be real with y'all I am

289
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:49,340
mentally physically emotionally and
spiritually exhausted I've been doing

290
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:54,230
YouTube consistently for eight years for
eight years I've been putting out videos

291
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:57,470
and for a lot of those years I've been
doing it twice a week plus the daily

292
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:01,940
vlogs it's been a lot I've enjoyed it I
love it but that doesn't take away from

293
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:05,090
the fact that it has been a lot which
leads me to the second reason I want to

294
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:09,080
take a break my content straight up I
haven't been super happy

295
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,830
with a lot of the content I've created
you know so she knows what she's talking

296
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:16,370
about
okay talking to a lot of youtubers from

297
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:21,890
my own experience if you are feeling
overwhelmed just like I say just take a

298
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:25,670
break
trying to monetize everything that's the

299
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:30,650
problem not every decision to make has
to be for your YouTube channel but

300
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:35,740
that's the mentality of youtubers that's
how a lot of us live our life you know

301
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:41,120
so I understand that it's hard to let go
of that but I think it's annoying seeing

302
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,710
these kind of like praised for making a
statement about may taking a break

303
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:51,230
because now that is just gonna be
further trend I think moving forward

304
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:56,840
since now this is an approved clickbait
by BBC News the other thing is I would

305
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:01,220
say at least from my personal opinion
our perspective is do other things get

306
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:05,300
other hobbies I think what of course
you're gonna feel drained out if the

307
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:09,800
only thing you do is YouTube because if
YouTube doesn't go well well that's the

308
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,340
only thing your life revolves around so
of course you're gonna feel like shit so

309
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:17,510
while I encourage everyone to take a
break if you feel overwhelmed and I'm

310
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:21,410
not trying to underplay taking care of
your mental health I don't think this is

311
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:26,120
a positive message to be spreading but
that's just my opinion anyhow that's all

312
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:30,740
for me for now thank you guys for
