the White Castle on Myrtle in Brooklyn and we're here to test out the new impossible burger the idea has been around for decades replaced that juicy burger with something a bit healthier thanks to startup impossible foods which is using science to create a 100% vegetable based burger that tastes and bleeds like the real thing to test this out we got 10 regular cheeseburgers and then 10 impossible vegetarian burgers to do a little compare and contrast [Music] we're gonna taste them to see which one to see if they taste different but first some really really really detailed close-ups [Music] overachiever this is neat no this is impossible yeah that's what I thought this is a neat burger right yes yeah that looks much more like this okay we're gonna start this test by first sampling the regular beef traditional White Castle slider familiar not to I will say there's nothing distinguishing Li beefy about this does this like beef or a burger or steak like a mushy wet you finish it okay now the moment you've all been waiting for this is the impossible real-life vs. impossible foot photo it does look better it looks better and it's heavier is heavier it's denser so that's high enough it smells smoky it smells beefier than the be okay right [Music] I like it better it's a little everybody laughing yeah it's not even close to a veggie burger or a tofu burger

[Applause] [Music]", "label": "G"}, {"data": "this afternoon I'll be flying from San Francisco to New York City in jetblue's mint first class suite this will be a comprehensive review of that experience [Music] now I've always been a very big fan of the Jet Blue like regular economy class is my favorite economy class this new first class experience it feels a little different from other airlines [Music] and now a brief tour of my suite over here on the window side of this big open kind of shelf like space it's honestly a lot of space I don't know what it's meant to be used for like a second person a small person could sleep up there I have a little door on my suite here ready now there's no shower on this plane obviously if not an Emirates plane dreams do come true I am showering on their friends but they do give you nice moist clean smelling towels to sort of clean yourself up with I mean you've got two power outlets they got one pen and USB great way to charge your camera batteries when you're making airplane to review videos mid-flight additionally there's a third power outlet on the right side I don't know I mean that's a lot of power out I appreciate it that's a lot of power outlets now just the right ear seat here is a cell phone holder water bottle holder [Music] TV here probably like 15 inches your TV remote is located right here [Applause] now over here is like that maybe another cell phone holder I got my toothbrush in there then there's this gigantic cubby right here I don't know what this cubbies made for its huge they turned the lights on your city over here our proceed legroom is pretty ridiculous the massage is not like those massage chairs at the mall I'm eternal [Music] compared to my bed at home it's lumpy and compared to an airplane seat it's an absolute dream foods here now one of my favorite parts a JetBlue or all the free snacks you get in the back but in the mint here you get actual dinner but the menu is a little different from other planes they give you all these choices of what you can get and you get to pick three from all the choice I'm gonna go with the ricotta gnudi the gross grilled salmon and the beef stew [Music] nope that's good so here we got my three dishes [Music] overall it's a pretty fantastic seat the amount of space but that's also my main criticism first class situation on [Music] see all the seats in mint cost the same you pay the same price whether you're in these big seats or in one of the two-seater see first class has a one-two-one one-two-one configuration meaning the people sitting in front of me and the people sitting behind me also in first class have a half the amount of space that I have but he's cost the same price [Music] p1 I know this is on my flight out here I was in one of these seats it was great don't get me wrong but it was also exactly half as good as the seat I'm in right now and that's why it's my main criticism these seats they should cost more money or something because they are way better than the others teat and every time I've flown in I'm always jealous of people that get these seats versus me in those other seats I know it's like that's not a big thing to complain about but it is like this is way better than what those people Weaver [Music] it's like 1:00 in the morning we're about 25 minutes from New York City the nice gentleman just gave me this a confetti cookie delicious thanks doubt me it's go right right please the German Shepherd aerosol [Music]", "label": "G"}, {"data": "[Music] this is gonna be like kind of a sappy love story videos I'll

it when it's cold love it when it's hot I love that even though you totally hate exercise you climb Lions head with me once in 2011 and I love you so much for that one time you thought you were eating raisins but you are actually eating live maggots I loved that one time in 2012 when when in order for me to get back together with you I had to sit down with you and agree to terms that you had typed up and presented to me at a meeting in a park [Music] I love that you support my races even though you need my races I'm like the homemade spectator for mild and I love I love that when your business

else in the entire world [Music] not just good [Music] you're just [Music]", "label": "G"}, {"data": "[Music] what are you getting for breakfast Oh probably the French house in Amsterdam with uh Peter MacKinnon here guys great dancer check this out from vlogs Pass see this bridge right here right here that's where I proposed to Candice so many years ago Oh Candice was actually supposed to be with me today instead I brought ah then I brought Peter so if you don't know Peter Peter is a fantastic youtuber he's a much better youtuber than me we're gonna spend the day where Peter teaches me how to make better vlogs thanks Peter no problem man [Music] we're in like the Courtyard hotel and they were like oh my god there were some people following us I think we're smiling though Peter what did you do before YouTube like why are you why are you why is your skill set with the camera so so next level the last job I had I spent seven years filming magicians around the world so I've had kind of the expertise the working expertise for seven straight years filming everywhere and then why why take your I take your skill set and your huge ass camera to YouTube I just I wanted a platform where I could share myself without limits and without anybody telling how I could do it so I figured that was just the best way and the best platform for it [Music] many years ago do you have any place to recommend to the right thank you [Music] down totally down you're like I'm really happy twelve-year-old Peter I've rode a bike and like had like the longest time and I'm pumped how am i doing the vlog by the way I think you're doing great so if everything looks good so far the cinematic sound when I read some bikes I do how do I make your globe float oh wait I can I got it I got it I got it Oh what you think renting bikes is a it's a good idea absolutely so we're gonna we're gonna start here come down here over here through here up here which I'll get into this bond Oh excellent penmanship winds how long did it take you to get to your first million subscribers well I guess wait for it wait for it it took nine months come on that's insane all right thank you sir [Music] [Music] you look good back there Peter they take their bike rules here really seriously so you got to stay on the correct side of the road you gotta obey traffic laws how is it you can vlog it there's a child coming at you how can you blog and ride anything I'd love to know that ready going through the tunnel my thesis on vlogging is that I try to do the best production quality I can but the story comes first so I never let my camera get in the way of the story that's why I don't carry a monster like this is because I don't feel like I could be spontaneous with such a beast yeah this definitely this definitely it's a beast you get used to it but this is turned into like a romantic honeymoon [Music] it's his first time in Amsterdam it's amazing here but we spending a lot of time in this kind of threshold to this parking garage because we're just getting so soaking wet its cinematic though its cinematic let's throw in a little bit of mckinnon slow-motion ready [Music] it's that kind of weather today where you can't be waxed it's just cold enough work you're wet and cold you'll get pneumonia we're just gonna wait for the rain to stop why is your lighting in your studio so good yeah I never used to die never used to put the work in the lighting always used the window and I was like wouldn't a light forever and then a friend of mine was like no buy a light so I bought a light diffused it set it up nice with a boom mic and everything and then suddenly if production values went through the riot in the studio and I turned my light out it looks like there's like a flashlight do you need to defuse light you can use a shower curtain you've got IKEA and buy a shower curtain just throw something in front of that light so it's softer then it'll look like just money Oh real quick we were having a lovely day on our bicycles and enjoying all that Amsterdam has back at the hotel Peter actually is staying in a separate hotel but then I checked in here and this hotel is huge so he's gonna sleep on that our couch and then I'm gonna sleep in the bedroom which is just down the hall so I said last week we remember I posted the video about Chantal that I wanted to put more energy into using my channel to talk about creators that I really liked and whose work I really liked so even though we're having fun and just out here sort of Peters channel if you haven't seen it Peters channel is the channel that I think like he brings a level of production quality to his work in his YouTube videos that there's not a lot of on this platform and I say kind of in jest that he's helping teach me how to vlog but I mean it like he is a he's a total practitioner when it comes to the act of photography and cinematography how do this is his vlogging camera it's not even a joke Peter's not he's no small youtuber Peters a very big youtuber he's very successful on the platform but if by chance you don't know of him or don't know of his work should definitely check it out it's below and he has like despite all the funny stuff he has genuinely like showed me a few of his tricks and how he achieves like the crazy production quality that his stuff has it's now heavy this is you could do it well you hold it by one of course better oh come on alright I'm try should we go return the bikes now yeah let's go take it back do you remember we're ready bikes home I think we go I think we go around but we have to hurry because the place is gonna close and then we're stuck with the bikes I miss the fall okay this is the coolest passport I've ever seen what what are these this is like yellow pages dude this is good what is that thank you Thanks so looking ahead what do you what do you hope to accomplish on YouTube what's the what's the master plan Peter I think master plan I just continue what I'm doing it's like the first time in my life I've been able to actually like work for myself and just have fun and like no limits so like maintaining that until the next thing grips me and I want to go after

product ok this this is a finished product up I have been waiting so long for this and I was especially heartbroken after losing my boosted boards in Colorado that look better hotel or exposed and man oh man I love to have one of these bastards while while i was in South America 40 boosted me likey are boosted board version 2 as abusive work better and there's one thing I know and that is that the only thing better than a brand-new version to boosted board is two brand-new version to boosted boards don't really need two of these things probably not to get overexcited and get two of these yeah any regrets none what so i boosted what is what is that was was loaded mean alright boosted five ready to be christened very very minor change of plans actually take the unmarked boosted six here instead of boosted five because the paint doesn't seem to want to dry and I like got all of my clothes in my hands I'm just gonna take the new new one that having pornero on yet i always say that i'm going to do a comprehensive review of things and then I never do but this is going to be different besides my camera I don't know of a gadget i have in my life that I take more damage up in my electric skateboard alright it's faster it grips the road better it's like it's like sticks to the ground and I know they said something about improved trucks and improve wheels but like you can really feel the difference it's like it like quarters like a lambo all right the rest the review is going to be to be continued remember book hi remember before when I said that my family was my number one in the spoofs it borders number two i promised candace i'd be home by six so we can do something tonight it's 603 so i just got home and nobody's here but check this out remember when Francine did that modeling for Juicy Couture it's her modeling photo all gigantic and frame like really you're good man for sending this over to find girls that they were in the pharmacy yeah she made it to find a friend seen this is uncharted territory for you that in mind that ladder give her some space and baby sleep Candace's asleep you know all this awesome traveling and only exploring everything I get to do it's amazing and I'm thankful and I'm happy everyday at the opportunity to do these things but at the end of all of it i don't think there's anything that makes me happier and feel more fulfilled than being home with the family sorry guys I don't mess up your wedding maybe sneak through their congratulations", "label": "G"}, {"data": "and my friend welcome to Chicago yeah

world's largest truck stop eighteen miles the world's largest truck stop eighteen miles to wow I really want to stop again what do you want to stop there it's the world's largest truck stop you . are you getting excited about the world's largest truck stop yes there's an antique shop and you don't buy antiques which one is the world's largest truck stop with this is gonna be a right i'm already disappointed it didn't even look as big as the other 12 wow look at all the pins you can get wow wow is like meet there on i-80 that's like maybe it'll stop here where you just on a whim thought that

it's like a church bell our winter talk longer far too she goin sushi was not good we have a very very long way to go tired of driving see there's this constant conflict between wanting to be as efficient and fast with your time as possible and not wanting this entire trip sitting in the car finding a balance there is elusive I brought the boosted for living that is just like kind of get out of the car gets there you need to proof before yeah yeah yeah yeah after midnight now hopefully it's our last fill up we're still very far from Colorado chatting in this gas station nice going to go ahead and end the episode there is a bit of a cliffhanger will we make it to Colorado tonight will only keep driving will keep making you listen to crappy use it who knows tune in tomorrow to find out

13-mile run this morning a little bit of green just bright head into the office really feeling the summer health cake punch summertime that's good [Music] and three [Music] what's up man [Music] I own six six boosted boards and right now four out of six are broken three out of six are in the shop two out of six kind of worked so you had to make a note on that because it's got a limited range maybe the battery's dead might be one of my really old ones it doesn't go very far so tomorrow tomorrow is the big day for Candace tomorrow's the day of her like huge party an event and whatever it's called for her company Billie sue most of the day today's going to be spent working with her to help prepare for the big day Thursday May 11 [Music] I would say only three to four times a week I heat my lunch up using a paint stripping gun direct heat kinda like a broiler get the job done [Applause] [Music] it's great I was supposed to meet Candace there but then she just asked me to meet her at home so now I'm going to meet Candace at home you know 10 years are you I'm doing hey how many lost party got in this one hot I got the G Wagen but it's what I wanna buy for my girl no fun I like it damn G maybe Candace and I are on a very special mission right now see tomorrow well tomorrow when this is posted Thursday is her party her event and we have a fun idea which involves a super car or a cool car being parked in front of her office we're going we're going to we're on a mission right now this kind of do it just right Houston I want to say he's so sight look him and his friend of the same exact car this guy's got the coolest cars ever believe these cars manling up a Lambo the Ferrari McLaren Porsche is that how you want to our car have you ever been here before what about that this is your favorite make my high school life this is a car that canvasses dad had when Camus was in high school and shoot on occasion borrow the NFS from him and drive it not even a Hello if you see a guy man Candace here in the bike walking shoes hey chase you're missing what's going on here this is the New York City Classic Car Club Mike here her Candace is beating on my cue Mike's a friend of I'm and he's that giving us a tour of the newspaper you guys tell you everything about it's going to be the greatest event this week [Music] definitely on the side so here's the concept she's going to have loaner this bright orange bronco park it in front of her shop during the event Thursday night and then on the side it's going to say Billy company vehicle five inches 6 inches 7 inches I think they've got a tape measure it should always be bigger than you think father this is not mine my lips look like it but personally I would have gone with the Lamborghini here but Candace and I have different tastes thank you Sarah for having me thanks for loaning my wife your car I'll see you in a couple of days the way that that operation works there is you have to be a member of that Club but if you remember you can borrow any of those cars whenever you want I don't know why anyone alone want to be a member of a country fun right and they don't even have Lamborghinis at country clubs just dolls this is a safe here this is where her party's gonna be it's going to be well her office is just down there but this is where the party's going to be in here it's going to be awesome in the window is where there's gonna be the guy who's welding people's gold bracelets on and then Jeremy is going to be in there doing free tattoos for people and then let's go in not digging here I don't know what else popping you've gotta where you're going to have a DJ you're gonna you get pizza yeah she has somebody giving you booze are you getting the keg know what else I want everybody to know how cool this is gonna be it's hot I'm here what else is there music this is the big one look at this is the big one this is the big launch for Billy well yeah it's happening this is big deal of succeeding one two three one two three funky so this here this is the VIP rooms if you're a privileged invitee you can come into this room and just just enjoy yourself really maybe you want to maybe you want to find the ladder let's go home now so that's where that's where the parties univee can be great it would be exciting how many people did you invite not enough Morgan [Music] are you excited or nervous about the party I service because when you get involved I get nervous if you put all these expectations on me I know are all party that was not the response I was expecting kind of naively realizing right now as I finish this edit that a lot of you might be wondering if you can come to the party on Thursday night the answer for me is yes but the answer from campus is probably no it's a small space and she's going to have her like magazine editors and important people for her new business there but I mean I'll be there if you want to come say hi take a selfie in the street or something like that I'll be there with my skateboard I don't think that Jeremy should have enough time to tattoo all of you [Music] also those pictures right there they're not that's not Candace that is not that is not picture that's kid", "label": "G"}, {"data": "you're standing in front of it I can take your picture [Music] today is the big day tonight is the big night it is Candace's company's billy's launch party and it has a lot to deal with today so i'm being a really good husband right now because she forgot her cellphone at home so i'm bringing it to her because that's what thoughtful husband's do good over here every dumped adrenals ok she's freaking out a little bit you're freaking out a little bit too many people already Candace yeah why you're making me feel all stretched out nobody cares I guess ocean if that makes sense their dumpsters out front that I think should be moved but Kansas doesn't care about I care it's next New York City what are you gonna do and in dumpsters or cars this is not a porta potti all right wonderful excellent I know I may never see what is he the guy did you you didn't burn yours oh she's a great mother safe roses rehearse are you

a very successful company there's nothing sexier than a hard-working successful focused woman well I wouldn't certainly wouldn't say that their group I would say they're more sunlight than chicken white and I don't need to work it belongs anywhere near those days there's no step psychology that is me making the chickens ship from pocket well naked open it slightly profit I think Papa so more fries and chicken got the thin layer before the Emperor swear I'll quote I think both of us are pretty sexual jake has an affinity for Taco Bell are those new today Jake they just came out with the naked chicken this is not like a commercial for Taco Bell in fact don't eat them they're not good absolutely good at all no no no no I don't know why I run when you first took a bite you were like oh this is enjoyable and then you had your juice and the whole acquired special visitor today special special visitors today at being headquarters here not not Jake yeah but Justine's special I'm here because when Jake was talking about the red camera you cut him off and I was very upset so also I need to go here you know there was a three people loyal that would call me out on that and Justine is one of those can we go see the cameras came to cut you off really yeah [Music] very very very exciting day today at beam we are inching closer and closer to actually like publishing some content which

two canvases party officially started two minutes ago I'm late I call thereafter how sales were going she said they're going great so excited for that girl you always want the best for the people you care about the most but you see them try things you see them struggle through things and it's just like I believe in you everybody believes in you and then you see it all come together you see the fruits of their labors it just feels great [Music] [Music] [Applause] are going on here it's so close here if you need to run down rather than going it's over everyone has been very respectful and polite like waited in line for their stuff and like bunch of selfies and things like that it's just a little bit like we're all a little bit overwhelmed by what's going on outside like Morgan's taking a nice hiding back here though Mother's Day to me is sent into a heart [Music] I'm excited I'm doing it I'm getting a gold chain lasered onto my arm [Music] our hand into the box is happening I don't feel anything done good thank you sir you're welcome to master your crowd this is the official Billy I salute your chain on this occasion and it is Billy on this side story yeah [Music] it's going pretty well out there how do you think it's going good right people are really taking to the vodka shots things are loosening up now we're an hour and a half into the party two and a half hours 63 and a half hours to go why would you make it so late three and a half hours to go great crowd out there you put on a good show [Music] [Music] party's pretty much over it's like 11 o'clock no idea what really well a lot of excitement a lot of enthusiasm for his new brand much-deserved I think she did agree it's time people eat at home right so how are you going to get the strangers out strangers at this little time to leave music off at the end the night big success mega major success Oh", "label": "#"}, {"data": "you could hit this thing with a hammer and not break it [Music] [Applause] ready ah today's episode of tech review Tuesday we're gonna be asking one simple question which is which SmartWatch is the best SmartWatch [Music] and I do want to apologize for not having this week's tech review Tuesday intro complete dan who does the intros out of town will get to next week before I get into the specifics of each watch let me a little context so that is the SmartWatch spectrum on one end to be extreme is simply a watch this just tells the time doesn't know anything else they tell me the date just the time on the other end is a fully-fledged wrist computer and then the middle you have like a fitness sports focused watch and then what I think is probably the the best competitor to the Apple watch [Music] that's the spectrum now before I get into the intimacy's of each device there's another major factor to keep in mind as context when considering a SmartWatch and that is how much of a pain in the ass are they for what they give you in return and there is a very literal inversely proportional rationale to how much a SmartWatch can do versus how much you have to well how big of a how much of a pain in the ass it is [Music] so here is how the SmartWatch analysis will be taking place I'll be testing the watches build quality ecosystem capability and battery and this will include a regular watch watch the Garmin Phoenix five plus the Apple watch 444 millimeter and the big size galaxy watch now really the reason why I included a regular watch in this is because it's just sort of axes of control bibble quality first up on build is the Phoenix five plus the build quality is excellent on this thing it does have a crystal face like the Apple watch beyond that all the way around this is it's all stainless steel this is this is my old old one you see it's a little bit T it's a little bit scratched up a little bit weathered but these things are tough so overall they're good build quality on the on the garment now the series for Apple watch this thing is truly stunning like to hold in your hands does feel like you're holding a piece of jewelry look at that action smooth you could tell Johnny Ives just like polish this thing clean very impressed with the build quality of the Apple watch my previous Apple watch this is the generation 3 Apple watch it exploded I mean it literally exploded what I think happened to some salt water got under the screen battery expanded screen popped off but it's shattered these things are not built as tough as say a watch that looks like this the Apple watch is next up is the galaxy watch I will say the new galaxy watch has a certain heft to it it's stainless steel it feels dense compared to the old Galaxy gear watches it has a great weight to it it feels really solid the plat the bottom on this is plastic it does feel a little bit I don't know it feels less jewelry like and more electronics like when you when you feel that but it still has a substantial feel to it and the mechanics on it feel feel great here that the galaxy watch does have the weight of the stainless steel which is beautiful overall I've got to give it to the Phoenix 5 with the best build you can hit this thing with a hammer and not Fraser's just kidding next up is the ecosystem starting with our control watch this is just a watch it doesn't doesn't have an eco system there's no eco system none next up is the Phoenix 5 now you can download new watch faces on the app and I think you maybe download some apps for it and stuff but they're not super robust and a lot of the watch faces you can download are a little bit janky installing them is a little bit complicated so there is some ecosystem not a great ecosystem one thing it does well though for athletes is that the data that this collects does communicate with your other exercise apps like like straw or whatever it does that very well so that's kind of the only plus I would give this when it comes to ecosystem this is an area where the Apple watch really thrives and that ecosystem well it wasn't but after four years the ecosystem is now what you would expect from Apple and when you look to the new like heart rate features that this has the EKG features that this has I imagine that the ecosystem around this will only get more and more robust and the galaxy watch does have an impressive ecosystem this is a watch that's designed mainly for use with Android devices like your like your Galaxy Notes or whatever it is that you use but this doesn't use androids watch OS or whatever the hell it's called this uses a proprietary operating system that is owned by Samsung called Tizen Wow I think the operating system is really amazing on this it is limited in its its ecosystem because the only watches that carry it are these Samsung watches one caveat that I would say there about the Galaxy Watts it's kind of frustrating about the Apple watch is that the Apple watch doesn't allow third-party developers to design watch faces for it so it's pretty limited the galaxy watch does allow third-party developers to make faces for it so there's a broader selection here I don't know why Apple's so that's so limiting [Music] capability this is where I want to spend most of the times I think this is what differentiates these four devices see spoiler alert I don't know that I can say one is better than the other so really depends on what your needs are with that if you don't need a computer strapped to your wrist then you just get a damn watch you never have to think about it Ozzie tells you the time now if you want some smart capabilities well this is why I like the Garmin watch because for me it gives you the bare minimum of what you would kind of want so when you get a phone call it shows up on here you can't answer it on here you can't talk on here same with text messages it shows you the full text message on here beyond that when it comes to athletics I want my heart rate I want my my distance measured I want maps and and this does all of that and does that incredibly well so the capabilities on on this watch are vastly superior to just a regular old dumb watch but they aren't quite as robust is like a full-fledged smart watch this watch is basically a miniaturized iPhone strapped to your wrist and that could be a good thing or that could be a bad thing I will say historically I've gotten almost every I've gotten to I Apple watches before but I've stopped wearing both of them because it just ended up being too much on my wrist more than I wanted to deal with III didn't need all of that there when it was all in my pocket like I don't I don't know why this exists but I love this I can watch my own YouTube videos on this watch now that's a that's a third-party app that probably shouldn't exist but it does exist and I don't know I think that that's cool also for my capabilities perspective the operating system on the Galaxy watch I think is is certainly the best operating system any SmartWatch see because this is a round watch face when you bring up your apps like that you use this dial to navigate your apps and when you want to get into an app you just kind of tap it in the middle now comparing that the Apple watch where you do have a dial but it's this sort of is useful but touching and rotating this tiny little crown isn't quite as intuitive as having one here so judging the capabilities of these devices is very hard because quantity the amount of things it can do is less important to the user and how well it can do the few things that are important to you but the Garmin watch only does a few things but it does them incredibly well the Apple watch does a lot of things but much for how many of those things are going to actually use same with the galaxy watch does a lot of things but how many of those things am I gonna actually use and this really underscores what is kind of my conclusion on this whole thing when it comes to judging which box is best for you the first question is what do you need it for and then last up the easiest is battery life so a regular watch watch a quartz timed battery operated watch batteries last several years we'll just call that ever the single most impressive part about the Garmin is that this thing even though it has a full-color screen that's pretty low resolution and not that bright but a full color screen this battery depending on how much you use the GPS this battery will ask you two weeks if you use the GPS a lot it'll last you like five days the battery in this is incredibly impressive so much so that when I travel I typically don't bring the charger with me the Apple watch they say gets a full day I don't know why they're so modest about this I've only used it for a couple of days but so far I get way more than a full day it's not quite as good as the galaxy watch which gives you four days but I would say it's somewhere between the full day - advertised in the four days that this gives you [Music] so the conclusion here is that it's very very hard to objectively judge something like a SmartWatch because it has a lot less to do with the technical capabilities and far more to do with what exactly are you looking for in something that lives on your wrist I hate having to charge my cell phones every single day and one of the reasons why I've never stuck with the SmartWatch is because I hate having to also charge my watch every single day I also have a tendency to break everything everything I touch so the robustness of a watch is a big priority for me there's been a lot of chatter about the Apple watch I think it's deserving of most of that chatter because it is a very impressive device I do think this is the very best watch you could have on Android even though it doesn't run Android operating system so in conclusion which is best I don't know it really depends on what you want but what is exciting is that they're they're all pretty damn good I wouldn't underestimate these more simple athletic watches if you don't like the square on your wrist I wouldn't underestimate what the galaxy watch can do if you don't like carrying around a cell phone I wouldn't underestimate what a Smart Watch with an LTE chip in it could do I think we've arrived at a very interesting place with wearables and I'm excited about where they go next that is it for this week's tech Tuesday we'll see you back here next Tuesday with a great new intro from Dan mates [Music]", "label": "#"}, {"data": "[Music] [Music] it's been a while since my last vlog it's been like 12 or 18 days for like six months or something I wanted to give you a full update of everything that I've been up to for starters I'm still using Candace's closet to to shoot videos in thank you still eating $1.00 pizza good I'm also still drinking that green juice it's still delicious [Music] still riding like Bruce aboard this traffic still flying my drone I'm still riding my food support while flying my drone [Music] I'm still opening boxes Nike self-lacing hyperadapt oh yeah and my marriage is still perfect [Music] I gotta repair it easy I've been playing a lot of video games and I've been spending a lot of time planning videos that are like bigger production especially my holiday video but you're gonna learn all about soon I haven't done a production this complicated since well before I started vlogging on my way to the airport still doing this kind of a lot and I'm still back at the airport getting back back at the airport [Music] so yeah not like a whole whole lot has changed but then we're like a million more questions about exactly what I'm up to at CNN so [Music] so you know flying down here to Atlanta and this is where CNN's and eight quarters that's that's CNN headquarters right there so we're here for a day when I say we I mean the entire beam team is here in Atlanta with me CNN HQ beam team and this trip is just to meet some of the CNN staff like a lot of the tech people are here in Atlanta just wanted to come down here for a day say hello get to know them you guys look awesome so yeah in the video that I posted last week where I explained that I sold my company beam to CNN and I'm gonna be working for CNN now I gave zero explanation all I said is I don't know what we're doing and that's completely true but there is a lot of context that I can share with you that I haven't shared with you making a video every day on YouTube presented all kinds of opportunities and as I was assessing those opportunities like what do I want next for my own career I realized in order for me to go to the next level I needed to do things that were bigger than just me I needed more resources than I personally had access to as the YouTube channel and the vlog just exploded the opportunities became like I wanted something much bigger and now I had access to it one of the companies I met with was CNN and they were just as excited about working with me from a media perspective like a video TV YouTube everything perspective as they were about what we could do from a technology perspective with the squad at beam and I should say at first I was like this is never but as the conversations progressed I realized just how perfect of an opportunity this is exactly what I've been looking for beam and there are a lot of misconceptions about this but being first of all beam is a company we're a technology company were a software development company and we're definitely more than just the one app that we launched last year and that app we had a really successful launch but the app like you know we didn't compete with snapchat that's why we're shutting down the app now but there's a difference between the app and the company itself in CNN was very attracted to the company itself and it was the app that demonstrated what we were capable of as a technology company one very important distinction here and there's a lot of misinformation about this online especially in other people's YouTube videos who seem to just kind of be guessing all the intimacy's of this deal this was expressly not an aqua hire this is not a situation where CNN hired all of the or some of the employees of my tech company so they could use this guy over here to work on their website and this guy to work on their mobile app and beam the company we are staying together we are not leaving offices we're still gonna be operating on a team headquarters right here in downtown Manhattan in fact we're gonna be expanding and hiring more people to work out of this space right here not one team member left the company not one person was asked to leave the company not one person asked to leave the company we are staying together as the cohesive team we have always been focused on building technology and very in line with the mission that we've always subscribed to as a company the difference now is that we're going to be merging what I've been doing in the media space that is YouTube and what I did in films and what I did in TV and my whole knowledge of the media space and then what we've done in the technology space we're gonna put them together and create a new company and we're operating autonomously we are downtown CNN's uptown we are downtown CNN's here in Atlanta we have total freedom to create whatever we want to create and now we have that freedom with the vast resources of CNN and look I know I didn't answer any specifics as to how we're gonna do that and that's what I met in last week's video and I just kept saying I don't know what we're doing because we haven't defined the wooped and we're gonna take the next three five six months to really figure that out but that's the broader thing like that is what this whole acquisition that is what this entire thing is about the last thing that was like falsely reported ever I don't know where people get their facts on YouTube but this YouTube channel is mine this is my channel to do whatever I want with CNN did not buy this channel from a business perspective from an Adsense perspective from a creative perspective this channel will be my channel to do whatever I want including vlog if I decide I want to vlog in or whatever and again I just think that speaks to the confidence that CNN has in us to build something they didn't want this they want what's next and that was a huge part of what was so exciting for me so I hope that makes sense I hope that adds a little a little color to what I'm up to I'm excited I cannot remember the last time I was this excited for the future for what's to come next I will say I do I do miss vlogging I miss like the get up and go I miss the grind of like make something every day I miss clicking that upload button I miss like your feedback and your comments like I miss all of that but on the flip side of that like I love having my kind of sense of self back when you make a video for the world every day it's like am i doing this for me or am I doing this and the minute I stopped making videos every day I I kind of felt like I I kind of felt like I had my life back and that felt kind of special also not to be too like personal but at night where I used to sit by myself and my underwear in the dark editing my videos now I like sit in bed with canvas and we watch TV and stuff she's really cool I love hanging out with her all right that's it for this update I'll be uploading a bunch of videos really soon I'm doing something crazy for the holidays ah talk to you later [Music]", "label": "G"}, {"data": "I have a lot of fans in Japan yeah yeah should I have done this interview in Japanese [Music] [Music] thank you very much [Music] [Music] check out this framed picture of me here's another one but this is what my glasses and then it's me and it's a record this is remarkable such talent someone made this completely out of Legos there's work harder this is acrylic on wood really special really incredibly well done here but there's a holiday sweatshirt got my got my face on it this is a white sweater this is really cool look that's like all my electronics someone printed it onto a sweatshirt this is a super high quality of luminol skateboard and on that skateboard my face shirt that says my name on it jacket it says my name on it look at the back ego a person's sense of self-esteem or self-important narcissism excessive or erotic interest in oneself and one physical appearance alright I think to be an artist or a painter or a filmmaker creator of any type it means your ego is so big you think that the rest of the world cares about your perspective but even a youtuber who has such a big ego that he makes videos about his life every day because he thinks people care even my ego isn't big enough for all of these awesome paintings of me these are amazing works of art that people have made something but I can't put a picture of myself up and I can't wear a sweatshirt with my face on it I'm just not comfortable with that so I had an idea [Music] today it's hard to breathe with us on today and the other thing my nose is too big for this today in the USA is red nose day red nose day is a day where a whole bunch of money is raised and it's raised to help underprivileged children and that's kids here in the USA in all 50 states and kids around the world who don't have what they need to live a happy and healthy and fulfilling life so here's an idea I linked below a Facebook fundraiser every dollar that's donated today before the end of the day on actually said the date wrong it's every dollar donated today through June 15th 2017 every dollar that's donated will be doubled by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation I'm going to make a donation and here's the thing don't donate a dollar and what I'm going to do is once the fundraiser is complete I will randomly contact people who have donated via Facebook to get in touch with them and see which of these artworks or t-shirts or sculptures or skateboards or or little clay sculptures of me they might be interested in if you're not interested in any of this crazy KC paraphernalia which I would understand well then at least you're donating a dollar or some money the kids really need help I got to go now last year I wore it all day but it really is like my nose is too big for a red nose I gotta go don't late please be generous [Music] Harlan Harlan central island

like me one camera I'll edit it tonight and post it tomorrow so Kevin Hart it was amazing working with you amazing getting to know you a little bit I appreciate you and now a very special tech review Tuesday this tech review Tuesday is more about service than a product you can rent these little scooters it's kind of like uber for scooters you like get the app you push the button and then you just find one of these things and jump on love it here come here here's exactly how these scooter services work [Music] first you download the app and it's just like the uber app or anything else yeah putting your credit card number and some other oh they have you scan the front and back of your driver's license which I don't know kind of creeped me out but I guess I understand why it's necessary then once you jump through all those hoops you open the app and there's like a little QR scanner and you have to scan right here how do you stand it the scooter like beeps or whatever you get on and then you have an electric scooter for as long as you want - scooter companies here ones called bird and ones called line this one's a line scooter what's the difference between a lines for the one it's faster straight up faster birds or slowest like birds are pretty much is like the bird I just mean my dad just gone on it's pretty cool though I'd say yeah it says your line s electric scooters require one dollar to a lock and they charge you by the minute as you ride rates and promotions may vary across different rates so that doesn't tell me how much of all right so I don't know exactly how much these things cost I couldn't find that information online but what I read is it's like about five bucks every half an hour it just depends so they charge you by the minute and the rates are fluctuating five bucks you know what do you think I'm in awesome really good they're everywhere you use them often in like fourth time using em I use them in San Diego like yesterday are you drifting your scooter [Music] it's not really a nice garage to boot the board all right so my my final thoughts on the scooter situation this is for both the lime scooters and the bird scooters I'm of two schools of thought here one is that for somebody who needs transport to get around they're amazing you just jump on you go they get you there but for everyone else who's not using the scooters they kind of make the city a like a messier place to be they're not pleasant the whole idea seems very half-baked it's a half-baked because yes great way to get people around it's part absolute chaos because like the aspect of where you keep these things and how to not get them in everyone's way and just myriad other sort of logistical parts feels totally like no consideration but ultimately I think they're good because I use them and I I think there are very interesting glimpse into a future where like it's not required where there's like a shared transport that doesn't require a car or a bus and it's awesome it's awesome hey max what do you think of the like bird scooters and the lime scooters scooters in general I think there are menace to society and they need to be stopped at all Carly no I mean I get what's cool about them but like as someone who lives around here there's so many times we're like I'm just walking out of a store or like my dog is running out of a store and a scooter like almost runs him over or me and like they're just tourists who have no idea what the hell they're doing here and they're like they're veering off the path they're going the wrong way down the bike path I mean it's just it's it's a mess it's a mess it's dangerous someone's gonna lose an eye and it's all gonna be over [Music] all right so we spent the last 30 or 40 minutes I don't know if I should have been doing this or I'm gonna get in trouble for doing this but I was sharing with max the rough cuts of the Shawn Mendes documentary so he gave me some meaningful feedback because it's still a work in progress all right broadly what are your thoughts I think that this is the best video I've ever seen case you made are you saying let me say that a different way okay okay this is are you both know I think that this is really fantastic this is really great I almost like it more than the adventure and the surprise in South Africa that's one of my greatest that that one that one gets me but this this is real solid man I can't reach it job it's not me it's it's Zach and Brett and me it's the teamwork but thanks for the feet I got to go I got to go back to New York now by Maxie

facade New York City landmark laws and you can get away with so much in the city but when it comes like actually building stuff is an enormous enormous pain in the ass so we're able to overcome that we're making the exterior of 368 absolutely absolutely beautiful this was not from either of my two children but I appreciate this nonetheless in case you revived in have you the Father's Day present your friends at fatherly and Gillette this is not a paid whatever I wasn't aware I had friends at Gillette but thank you for this lovely razor and shaving cream house time with her wife going man oh

minutes problem solved Hey ac number two is in I didn't know you're coming back you call me okay so this is Terrell we're just talking about being a model in New York City now isn't just about being the best looking you're like having the best energy yep but that you have to have a certain amount of social media followers to get booked that's that's definitely a true fact because I've definitely multiple bookings such I think it's Macy's you need um pink 30,000 they won't even book you without ya like you need like the followers influence over life people of our age group especially since I'm 22 so okay so I think that's bull so what I'm going to do is I'm going to link your Instagram handle right there so you can get the job with Macy's oh what's your count now here let me see your feet okay so Carly jor-el has 4815 followers this will be an interesting looks pair and look at these great photos what's a yo if it does go the remainder of this photo shoot is taking place in the roof

get that Instagram hopefully okay yeah bye honey she's five months pregnant and runs two companies you know my wife and I were both footballs to take our work very seriously that's the glue that binds us [Music] are we doing tattoos are we gonna do tattoo review Tuesday because I can't feel tech review Tuesday today because the Sony camera never showed up okay tattoo review Tuesday are you down Tuesday Tuesday okay I talked about doing tattoos in the window of 360 is our first art installation this is Jeremy he's a tattoo artist and just a regular artist Jeremy Oh Jeremy and I used to work together but I had to fire him because we look too much alike [Music] [Music] miss you I'm in a circus okay this is the first cities philosophy okay this is the first contact go one of these why are we doing touching you say is this your idea my idea your idea do you make this me this morning tattoo Tuesday [Music] didn't always turn see the idea with this front space at three six eight there's not two just have like a retail outlet where we sell t-shirts but they have it'd be like an active there's always something going on and that's why we're gonna start with Jeremy having is like tattoo parlor here and then they'll be an area over there where you can't actually buy stuff it's a way of having a part of three six eight be interactive with the public and open to the public when is this am I making any sense yeah these canals just waiting for you to say there's gonna be a skate trap the public that's never for the public that's for us I'm sorry that the legalities of having a public skate park okay so all that's left now is the bit that goes onto my hand and onto my finger and we are done brace yourself for this rose water the fingers painful [Music] all right so this tattoo that says New York City's summer 2018 and really I just drew this in like two seconds on a cardboard box over there and Jeremy put it on my arm but the reason why I got this is like all of my tattoos are sort of notes that capture like a moment in my life I've made a movie about this it's linked below and summer 2018 is like the last summer where before Kinison I have another kid it's the last time with just one baby in the house it's maybe even my last summer where I live in New York City it's the first summer where I started 368 it's the first summer where the Dan was here and this is just it just feels like I really I really like this year has been a inflection point like a turning point in my whole life and this is just a way to capture that moment forever I'll see you back from my trip

recital went really well especially considering the last recital she just stood there she actually sheckly danced this time we're very very proud parents this morning so I have a bit of a problem here with my my bike which is that I travel with the charger to keep this thing full but I ain't got nowhere to put it also I keep a lock with me and I know we're gonna put that either so that's also in the backpack those are two problems I'm looking to rectify today [Music] hey doing locks I'm looking for a lock I want a lock that attaches to my bike in a way that's like seamless I mean this one does like a velcro strap unlike the down tube only more secure than velcro [Music] sometimes it's okay so I don't know how to attach it yet but I think I got the right lock to attempt to attach why are there palm trees in New York City must be some sort of some sort of party happening in there you hear out loud this is this is the block dear [Music] funny story well not such a funny story but true story right right when Candace and I got married we got our dream apartment which was which was this awesome loft right across the street from the studio in fact if you watch the early episodes of the vlogs you'll see me like skateboard and hoverboard remember those things hoverboard from my apartment to this office and the reason why we moved is because 24 hours a day seven days a week with some version of that noise it never ever stops never underestimate the versatility of zip ties so what I'm thinking here is attach the charger right there under the seat run the cable up leave it permanently plugged in and then have the DAC plug just sort of kind of hanging loose and I'll wrap it around the frame first zip tie already feels good and secure all right now I'm gonna run this cable huh into the charging port there and then I need to tighten up this cable which I will do with these lighter-weight zip ties [Music] last sanity to solve for here's what to do with this cable maybe just wrap it around here it doesn't look pretty but that's not the point okay now when I need to charge my bike I can just plug it in and I no longer have to carry the charger hey that's a nice bird thank you I like your tripod what's your bird's name is dusty H projects an art gallery when I was a younger man that art gallery was like the hottest place in Soho to hang out lock the bike up

it's real who's that professor Horatio Hart Ryan it is urgent that you come to my laboratory immediately all right Steele that's me funny little man the computers talking to me Ryan Steele that's me by the way the man who played a professor Horatio Hart here had a very long industrious career Julian if you're out there contact me say up with the YouTube channel I want to see the ten hours Julian combs absolute dead emotionless compilation but we fear most has happened mr. sector professor heart has contacted Ryan Steele one thing we didn't need that's the one day shit if only we could have thought of some way to stop this like murdering him or something horses of darkness empower me take me back to my virtual reality oh we got a lightning snow globe in play he's not messing around that escalated quickly are brave enough guys man you could talk to any windows guys it'd bring another guy on the scream I mean for Christ's sake Johnny still must not be allowed to reach professor Hart this story I'm not saying it's bad you just saying all of a sudden you know got a little more complicated got a couple more characters to follow here now so apparently Ryan and Friends have been targeted by the evil Grimm lore he then sends his virtual henchman to the real world or are they in the virtual world that who cares Saban sure doesn't what was that I think that was a plain robot shooting missiles our car they that's what that was get out of here you guys will be safer in the woods you're not gonna be safer what was it Wednesday gonna be much safer wait oh wow yeah it's the bridge come on on my way to this real structure [Music] familiar faces so one commercial break later and our heroes somehow escape the two attack drones off screen when they stumble upon a rejected art house project in the middle of nowhere what is this looks like some kind of portal or a gateway oh it looks like a portal or a gateway you say how many of those you seen in your time you can just identify them on sight you just like portal portal gateway gateway gateway indoor portal clearly please enter the portal well here goes why are our no but it's probably a good sign that giant metal door slammed behind you yes what do you know about my father sir first look behind you for three be our visors amazing oh say no more professor are its become crystal clear Oh do not be alarmed you're looking through the reality berry okay Toyota turned the virtual reality off has a look that's a little too much for Chile out of there dad is it really you are you live it's a virtual reality play better oh come on that was two perfectly timed you're in virtual reality together man you just leaning right into him must listen to the professor very very carefully dire circumstances must have arisen for him to a brought you here and I can only imagine that it involves Greenland I want to cut you off we don't want to stop you just curious how you know all this weird been for ten years okay why'd you leave me you left me up on a Chinese Hill can we talk about that so VR dad explains how grim Lord can be defeated and that by using the spirit stones from ocarina of time these young teenagers can transform into the Mighty Morphin Power I mean the vr troopers yeah that that's that's what they are meanwhile Ryan tries to connect with his pops but things get a little awkward any pieces out he could at least send an alimony payment in like Bitcoin or something cheap bastard [Music] Brij the professor when you must stop quickly come on do they were just giving you a hail grim Lord what do you would professor grim Lords our professor you're gonna have to step back from the camera so would it kill you to smile for once super transform all right all of a sudden he just that just it just came to him he remembered his instincts when we were kids we didn't we didn't ask any questions didn't we you're just like yeah of course trooper transform damn straight an all-out war and hey these parts were actually pretty cool there he goes he's got a busted shoulder see yeah just actually throw himself off a cliff for that shot so Ryan gets knocked out so hard the episode ends meanwhile in part two Caitlin and JV returned home only to realize they left Ryan for dead in the middle of nowhere whoops I just can't do it dad my god poor guy got hit so hard he reverted to being a baby I tried my best but I'm not goodness I'm a farrier you gotta fear your son use the regular run-of-the-mill failure don't be so easy on yourself JB is there any sign of Ryan yet it doesn't make sense these were his last coordinates wait a minute I see him fuck his dog I wish there was way we could get to him faster he's gonna be okay right I hope so there's something wrong I can't control it oh no hit divert the fucking brakes a neglected to mention that I took the liberty of making a few adjustments on your car all right now you can put the inspirational music on all you want end of the day Horatio you just drove two children off a cliff without tell them alright what if one of them jumped out preemptively hit their head in a rock started speaking in tongues how do you feel then yeah also why do you guys leave me for like 14 hours I'm dying of sunstroke back at the lab Ryan is rescued gets healed up and everything's hunky-dory except for that little Galactic Emperor problem you know nothing big it is certain that grim Lord will launch a full-scale offensive very soon this is the sort of opponent you'll be facing selten toxoid okay slow down don't you roll your eyes at me I don't see you going toe to toe out there in the field with fucking cannon nose those guys are serious you telling me Jeff no Jeff don't go in the ding gang you'll enter your brains gonna get zapped the electricity in your brains gonna get turned off Jeff you okay yeah sure I'm just fine Ryan that dog is a lying son we've got to keep this a secret Jim you've got to promise me that you will never let anybody know that you can talk I don't think the world is ready for it just yet yeah this is the one you got to keep secret you never said that when there were turbo Tron's and cannon noses VR dad's none of that was meant to be kept secret but this one okay the population is not gonna be able to handle that one okay got to put that one behind area 51 back at evil HQ Grand Lord finishes his part-time shift as Galactic Emperor to return to his day job as real estate tycoon slash iguana Whisperer either like a game isn't it what's the name of this game I win oh I know this fun this is my favorite one man I remember that being a lot more fun when I was younger what exactly do you do here everyone else in this show looks like they have a plausible job even Horatio Hart looks like he's got a more plausible job than you woody after catching woody in an act of workplace incompetence Caitlin takes the day off to get the next big scoop on grim Lords advancing army of toy miniatures I said this will let us communicate with him from any computer yes troopers is there a problem oh shit I remember when Horatio Hart used to come on floppy disk those were the days although this looks a bit different than I remember which one that I have I saw me Jose Jose Kong Sally like I said are you a robot stop damn he bade Chinese knockoff after finding irrefutable evidence that grim Lord is a big meanie who smells our hero's suit up and set out to beat him for good Ryan you must go to village I'm sorry to keep just a little bit back even I mean like even here it's a bit close but cuz you like hello Ryan it's good to see you inside your mask can you give me a little key I'd like a kiss just a little one all right guys one of the time now get professor this is like another show I don't think I've ever seen a show like this this is completely unique show I can handle this it's like a video game whoa killed those dudes just like a video game this explosive otter blowing leaves are - yeah this bomb ought to do the trick of blowing everything up not satisfied with the obliteration of grim Lords aerial troops Ryan takes to the ground to finish off the remaining weak and wounded take that sick tour following the deaths of dozens to hundreds Grimm Lord finally admits defeat and the gang celebrates with an awesome slow-mo high-five I called you here to congratulate you on a job well done so what now professor yeah I mean oh we've done with this Grimm Lord God for good well unfortunately there are at least 90 more episodes of this show so probably not enjoy your moment of triumph ah okay you may have won the battle damn dog always double taken making goofs in front of the supreme lord of the universe with the day saved ryan returns to trespassing private property so we can think about his rogue parents once again and a long fight it'll be but if there's one thing you taught me it's to never give up no matter how hard it gets I won't quit until you and I are together again I love you Ted you know after all this it makes me wonder if I'm ever gonna see my dad again he said he was gonna go out and buy me a parakeet but he never came back so either he was lying or he was hit by something large and fast but it's just like dad always told me never give up unless it's looking for me but I'll never give up the search for my old man and I'll find you even if you are a skeleton in a shallow grave on the shoulder of a highway I'm coming for you scuse me sorry to bother you have you seen my dad yeah my dad yeah my dad have you seen him around here he left me here like

is it this is the moment of truth the radiology centers right there and they're gonna like they're gonna look inside my knee and let me know if this is like see I'm not a guy who's afraid of much I'm not afraid of fast motorcycles jumping out of airplanes flying in helicopters risk risk is something I typically do not avoid there are only a few things in life that scare the everliving shit out of me and this video is about one of those things I'm injured something is wrong with my leg and there's definitely a chance that I'll never be able to run your you and I are the same age what does this mean for the rest of your life that's my sister she had a knee injury she kept running and now she's trying to trying to she can't run like she wants to and she'll never be able to again the rest of her life I don't love going to the doctor I don't ever look like the doctor now I first noticed the pain in early July that was like three months ago and here's the thing I run like 60 to 80 miles a week every week and I've done about that for the last 10 years plus you get pains all the time this one was a little different it was persistent it never went away I haven't been totally responsible the minute I felt a pain I went to a guy a running specialist he taught me some stretches I've been doing it you're lying your side faced me and now then get on a diet I'll try to do 50 reps [Music] I shouldn't be able to run I have no business front I broke my leg about a decade ago I broke in 27 places this right here this is all metal and in the hospital the doctor told me Casey you're never gonna be able to run again but I was 26 years old then there's no way I was gonna let that doctor tell me I was never gonna run again and since that day since the doctor told me I'd never run again ever I've run twenty four marathons have done four full distance Iron Man's that's 140 mile races I've done God knows how many other races 5ks 10ks half marathons sprint distance triathlons Olympic distance triathlon is half dissident ironmouth I've done them all I've done nothing but races and running to last decade and for some reason this has got me freaked oh wow go in the moment and I'm sewing and they say I'm possessed it's the oh man keeping 300 like the Romans 300 bitches where the Trojans baby and the moment up in a minute so filing me I could eat shit bout to go I'm doing honey but there's nowhere to go and there's no way to slow if I knew what I knew in the pan I would have been like that on your way you gotta leave all my stuff in here including this camera to go and check me out now now I've got an addictive personality it's why it's why I don't do drugs I avoid drinking I I focus on the things in life that I can let myself become addicted to that's family that's worked and that's running but running running is a unique part of my personality of my brain of Who I am I run almost every single day I don't have my runs when I'm tired I and my runs when I ran out of time if I had more time I would run more I run once a day sometimes twice a day I run a dozen miles on Monday another dozen on Tuesday and I'll keep that going until some sort of external force gets in my way my life in general family friends the noises the distraction my work everything is non-stop everything in life is just absolute chaos I'd have it no other way but through all of that mania through all that cast there's one consistent there's one thing that's mine one thing that I absolutely can't live without one thing that makes me sane one thing that grounds me and that that one thing is running [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] well good news and I've got no news turns out it takes 24 to 48 hours before my doctor gets to review that MRI and I find out what's going on so this is gonna have to be a to be continued episode sorry I don't have a real ending but trust me when I say your desire to find out the conclusion to this story is nothing compared to my desire to find out the conclusion to this story [Music]", "label": "G"}, {"data": "Saigo so what this is here this is the just announced today GoPro Hero 7 black a little over a month ago GoPro invited me and a bunch of other tech journalists about tech journalists play inviting me any way out to this really fun like waterpark mountain bikes David venture to test these things out I haven't been able to post any footage from X that's been under an embargo but here today I get to finally share with you my experience in testing the hero 7 black [Music] look great let's see if there's any sound all right I'm here where are we New Jersey what's this town called I'm here in Vernon New Jersey and right behind me here are you making a video to use the same time making a video filming you filming me filming you filming me okay let's go to this camera this is Nick here he's the founder CEO of GoPro so pitch me on this tell me what this is oh man here are seven blacks the best GoPro we've ever made and it's the biggest leap forward and performance since the original HD hero back in 2009 High Definition was the first thing that put GoPro on the map and hyper smooth is today this is the gimbal killer so we're all about helping people capture their active lifestyles and with activity comes motion and with motion generally comes shake this thing captures the best stabilized video of any camera ever [Music] I gotta put my camera on there [Music] hold on this is Zack here Zack is the guide for downhill mountain biking what what do I need to know do you Zack who's your favorite youtuber [Music] all right so this is gonna be the GoPro downhill tests all I'm gonna do both stabilize and then unstabilized and I'll try to show you like side-by-side but I got to turn this camera off because I can't actually ride with this camera this recording to do that [Music] [Music] do you think that youtubers can vlog with the hero 7 yeah I don't I uh personally I don't understand why you guys are still using these massive cameras when we've made this badass like self capture solution I get it for certain application sort of but yeah you can absolutely vlog with this thing man we've improved the audio performance so increase the dynamic range you get more natural voices and you don't have to be lugging or I mean look at the size of this thing dude by the way to the waterpark this is Jeremy what's up guys Jeremy was a u.s. army green beret Special Forces they say that right yeah you're correct and now is product marketing at GoPro how'd you go from Special Forces to product marketing of velcro you know I decided to get out of the military and got hooked up with their product team I actually tested hero 3 plus for them when I was in the military doing skydives really seriously other wear helmet yeah oh yeah do we go in the same tube get ready thanks guys [Applause] Oh God improved audio I think GoPros have never been known for their great audio [Music] okay how often this thing gets seriously hurt on this slide he can be honest [Music] yeah that's me require neck brace in the morning I think there was a period where a gimbal was really exciting and people were psyched on see stabilized footage that accessible but we've made it even more accessible with hyper smooth rest in peace rest in peace gimbal okay Nick thank you for subjecting yourself to my interviews thanks bro I'm gonna start using this to vlog with it's way lighter [Music] I went to today knowing I was going to see the new GoPro and I had a lot of skepticism I just don't see what the point is in having another GoPro but after spending the day with the same seeing some of the footage seeing what it's capable of I get it it won me over I guess the question that needs to be answered is is this thing worth four hundred dollars and the question I had for Nick and didn't really have a satisfying answer for me was our cell phones now they're waterproof they have 4k high resolution super high quality cameras built into them and if we're gonna spend money on something good you know something better than our phones typically we're gonna target something like this so between the spectrum of a cell phone and an SLR camera where does the GoPro fit in and I don't know I think it's a very I think it's a very tough question if you're professional filmmaker youtuber like me absolute necessity but if you're someone who has limited resources in what you can afford for hardware I don't know that this would be the first thing you'd spend 400 bucks on it is an amazing product it is by far the best GoPro GoPro has ever released I will continue to use this in this vlog and now that the embargo has been lifted I'll actually let you know when I shoot it on the GoPro ok [Music]", "label": "G"},

that makes you think of how your mom cook for you or you spell a perfume or a clone that makes you think of a past lover whenever I smell like a burning building in New York City it it brings back these memories that for them I do it brings back these memories that are completely dormant in my brain of being here on September 11 I mean it's not like traumatic or anything but they are memories that I would prefer not to confront and when I smell like a there's a fire in the city it's just like hits me [Music] honey I saw like a big fire by Houston and like West Side Highway like a proper fire like smoke say that again are you excited that we can have another baby I'm just saying we could if we wanted to we don't can this had a doctor's appointment this morning where the doctor said

get through this episode would be three hours long if I went through all these boxes but I'll do it I'm gonna get through all these just not right now I got to go home tomorrow here on the show I gotta bring you fully up to speed with everything we're up to [Music] [Music]", "label": "G"}, {"data": "[Music] [Applause] this video is going to be a comprehensive review of the video recording capabilities of the iPhone 8 plus versus the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 as a youtuber the video quality on my phone is one of most important things to me so that's the only thing I'm gonna be looking at in this video nothing else except for what these things are capable of when shooting video I built this here rig to record video on that way the iPhone and the Galaxy are both recording the same image at the same time the lenses are as close together as possible enabling me to cut from one to the other so for the rest of the video starting right now every shot will be captured on one of these two phones enabling me to compare and contrast the image from one to the other Samsung therefore this is less of review and more of a side-by-side comparison I will not be issuing an opinion here I just want to show you what both of these phones are capable of okay and now a very brief studio tour using the respective cameras [Music] so this is my camera collection back here on the note here's a good opportunity to see the skin color differences on the iPhone versus the note 8 the iPhone here appears to be like a little bit more neutral and a little bit more dim than the note 8 which offers a kind of feels a little bright here [Music] bin buffer on either of these this outdoor skate for test is a very good test of the optical image stabilization which both of these phones have which should yield a buttery smooth image when you have little movements like honesty [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] these phones both these cameras have manual features to wrack exposure rack focus I'm not doing any of that for this test I'm just clicking the record button and then leaving them alone so this is really a stripped-down raw video test Lady Liberty that is the Statue of Liberty right there I'm now going to test looking at livery [Music] [Music] Samson tends to be slightly more cool and iPhone this is the purple flower test meant to show off also this is a great way to check out the dynamic range these flowers are really bright these are in shade these shouldn't be blown out they shouldn't look white they should still be purple these shouldn't be black it shouldn't be dark they should still be purple this will be the slow all right that just about concludes my test one detail that I didn't capture in that camera test is the iPhone has 256 gigs of internal storage which is definitely a lot it's enough the Samsung though has removable storage so have a micro SD card laying around but that means it uses the same SD card is like a GoPro or a lot of other cameras I prefer that but again this is unbiased sort of sampling I just want to show that detail with you the other thing I needed to say is that this side-by-side technique is something I stole from my friend super-sad he's a much better tech reviewer than me I will link him in the description below what about me I'm writing here man hello something Sam below he contributed to this video zero [Music]",

it's uh it's a warm one I I recognize this this pattern we always get these hot couple of days in September and then that's it and then BOOM it's October and it's freezing so I'm not complaining about this weather I love this weather I cherish this weather and I appreciate it soon and I'll be running in a winter coat instead of running without a shirt on so very happy very happy today ninety degrees out I'm gaming monitors here I mean for one it doesn't really fit on the destined for - it's all can't figure out the formatting hey can you come help me set up my gaming situation ok ok I'll see you I don't know what I'd do without that guy you know I almost got it set up but like it's like 32 by 9 aspect ratio or something and this gonna happen or should I just give up no it's done I did it it should work but the resolution is fixed the game will look epic on this obnoxious like you can't even you can't see the whole thing in one glance alright let me explain what's going on this is like this is a sponsored video we're doing a project with EA around battlefield 5 which is launching soon wait is the game gonna fill the whole screen it should shut and we're in we're in the open access right now multiplayer 5 days left ok let's say anything we're doing a big project with them but right now we're just gonna try to get the game of work but also I just realize you don't have speakers in here let me get speakers let me get speakers Rael I'm in a proper game right now you just die you're logged into my my account you want to try a terrible gamer I'm the worst gamer I'll see you I'll see you so where it gets really into work gets really interesting is over in 368 looks like a storms are brewing out here [Music] I just uh I just wanted to sit up here for the the Vantage so you get a better look of what this space looks like so here's what we're doing we are building down here not like a proper tournament space because we don't have the real estate for that but we're building for for Saturday for tomorrow just like a four-person kind of like practice space and ultimately we'll build this out so it's an eight or sixteen person practice space or gaming space down here but for Saturday we're racing to do a four-person gaming space game and because we're working with EA directly on this they're bringing in a couple of gamers we're gonna be streaming from down here it'll be the first time the 368 gaming space is used and because this is like sponsored by EA and we're doing this with EA it's a it's a big thing I think there's gonna be 64 different gamers on a single server all over the world though and we'll all be competing against one another which is cool but what's even cooler is the fact that we're doing it out of three six eight the hard part of all this is getting this space ready by Saturday [Music] this is all gonna be linked below but if you want to follow along the streams me Saturday at 10:00 a.m. California time which is 1:00 p.m. New York time where it's all below in the description [Music] what day next week is the activation it would be good is if you like give me a tattoo for this scene as I'm talking about okay all right so all right so this is the three six eight store right here this is where like last week's video you saw me in here selling t-shirts we've been working hard to open this space and we're going to open it to the public I think one day next week we have something called the sidewalk permit which means it's kind of expensive you have to pay for days where's new one day I'll let you know what day and on that day in addition to like selling whatever crap we can come up with Jeremy here is going to set up a tiny it's more of an art installation but like a tattoo parlor right here in this window right so yeah tattoos okay so let me explain how it works it's really good okay Jeremy every time okay so here's how it works Jeremy is gonna make a selection of drawings like his little drawings and then we have a website I'll link it is it alive I'll link it below you like go on there you look at his drawings and then you sign up to come get attached it all tattoos are 100 bucks even because that just seems right you can only pick one of Jeremy's drawings do you pick where it goes no they can pick where it goes no face tattoos right no face tattoos no face unfortunately you only do a couple a day but it's still dope yeah it'll be fun and then secretly not secretly like today when you're seeing this video three people today as like as you're seeing this video can come in and get a tattoo I'll link the site below I'm sure they'll already be three dudes lined up but like that's the plan and again it's not about turning three six eight into like a tattoo parlor Jeremy's just a rad street artist rad tattoo artist and we're like [Music] tomorrow notepaper you're gonna be behind here and you even have a peanut gallery out here watching you tattoo is that cool you know last week I made a video about ambition and doing too much and not knowing when to say no and it's just like last night we did that serious lightly last night we did that Taco Tuesday which was a small deal but it was also a big deal too as a first and then even tomorrow Jeremy's a little tight to experiment again a small deal but it's a first and then next week we're opening up the space to the public that's a first this thing we're doing with EA and Battlefield five on Saturday tomorrow that's a first and all of this is culminating like all this is happening at the same time that Candice just keeps like inching closer to the due date the baby is doing like I think for four weeks in two days right now it's just a lot and I couldn't be more excited I couldn't be happier I think the feeling right now is one of being totally overwhelmed and I think the only thing you can do when you feel overwhelmed is just keep going and that's the plan what's good [Music]", "label": "G"}, {"data": "[Music] [Laughter] [Music] this is the DJI spark come DJI spark 5 combo fly more combo pack this is the official DJI spark I did do an earlier video about the spark but that was with a prototype unit this is the official shippable unit as it will appear in stores biggest detail here in this box is the controller for the spark now for this video we comparing the sparks with the controller to the DJI Mavic with controller I do want to make it abundantly clear before I begin this review that I'm not being paid by a I've never been paid 5 DJI this is an impartial review but I'm a huge fan of DJI so it's sort of like a little bit bias because I like the product so much first the unboxing documentation this is the actual drone battery extra propellers solar propeller guard charger AC adapter the charger that's everything the bag yet the case yet the drone itself eight I think eight propeller blade or propeller guards you get the charger and get two batteries and I think it maybe even comes with an SD card this is six hundred ninety nine bucks seems like a good deal now one interesting kid that I did want to zero in on be consisting is all about portability is this is the case it comes with this is the case you need for the battery for the charger for the controller for everything this is the case that the Mavic prompted now the Mavic is a considerably bigger drone them the spark but at the end of the day you need all this stuff with you so you're carrying it all in the case matter case spark case they're almost the same size they're going to take up almost the same amount of real estate in your backpack that's an interesting consideration okay let's get into this then this is the controller for the DJI spark and this is a controller for the Maverick both extremely similar looking devices I will say this one feels the spark one feels a little bit lighter and like maybe a little bit cheaper feeling and the spark does not have this LED readout the nabek controller does have now without having actually use this yet I can tell you the LED readout is not super critical because you always use these controllers of the phone information presented on this LED readout is redundant to the phone not entirely necessary I think they put it on the Maverick because they intended for people to use the controller without a phone but who wants that you can't see the picture to lay out the same buttons are the same got these great little x-wing fighter arms here and that's where you stick and that's where you stick the phone I do want to say as a very strong aside DJ I made a lot of fuss about the fact that you can control these and they're fully operational using justa phone you can also use hand controls things like that I think that's great whatever it feels a little bit like a gimmick to me I want to use a drone to take beautiful aerial cinematography whether it's a tiny drone or a big drone and when you just have a phone you're trying to use essentially buttons that have this kind of tactical feedback you're trying to emulate that using nothing but a touchscreen it's imprecise on top of it being harder to control because of the lack of buttons and this is a really big deal when you're using your phone it's nothing more than the Wi-Fi signal from your phone so the range is severely limited every time I use the spark using just my phone it was never able to get more than really like 70 or 80 feet away from me now in the box here are these propeller guards they attach on something like this propeller guards are really great for two things that if you're a total novice a total beginner they will protect your drone and two if you're flying indoors in really tight quarters they'll also be helpful there and not really for me though [Music] for the extra light test I'm going to go outside to a more open safe location but now I've had this spark prototype for a few months one aspect of the sparked it's sort of hard to capture the review like this is how quiet and discreet it is even thematic when you fire that thing up it does a super fit and it acts a crowd and then it grew loud but the spark is quiet and small and somewhat innocuous people see it as a toy instead of a my single favorite feature of the spark and this may seem silly but this is a big deal for me is the fact that you can just plug a microUSB cable into the spark itself in charge of the battery portable battery charger plug it in this thing is charging right now that's a big deal it can be charging in my backpack alright so this is me setting up the controller for the DJI spark for the first time you have to go into your phone and like literally connect to the Wi-Fi it doesn't say the password button below the password to the Wi-Fi perfectly Wi-Fi password is located under the stickers that are basically inaudible okay I think I've got it just you know that took me 20 minutes to figure out that whole setup process was confusing and frustrating and took a long time but I'm hoping maybe that's just because it was the first time that I did it now at a time for a long awaited flight test now what I'm going to try and do is do some complicated but beautiful cinematography with the drone and then try to replicate that cinematography with thematic compare the two shot so cute [Music] this looks really good [Music] all right I do have to say responsive responsiveness feels fantastic the image preview quality that you get on the screen right here is dynamite my complaints about radio versus Wi-Fi are unfounded it's really really good and the drone is way the hell out there one of the biggest technical hurdles of the spark versus the phantom or any of the other DJI drones is that this only shoots in 1080 that's the highest resolution thematic issue ting natively in 4k now if you're watching this back on a cell phone you might not be able to tell but watch it back in 4k on a big monitor you'll be able to see the difference and it's it's significant [Music] okay despite all my bitching about that Wi-Fi nonsense that was pretty incredible I think it way further than I had expected the image quality on this thing was amazing and [Music] all right so in conclusion biggest concerns with this were around it's like fly ability how easy is it to control in the air because on the phone they kind of suck using the controller it's perfect it's ace it's everything I wanted it's incredible controls are tight they're if they're specific it's responsive it does exactly what you want it to do it just kind of leaves one big question which is the million dollar or a 300 Oller question which is for $6.99 for the whole package do you get this or for 9.99 to get the whole package of the mavet and I think it if you're a novice if you're new to drone this is the way to go save the money and this thing is amazing if you've had any experience or you have bigger aspirations for what you can do with the drone spend the extra money get the Mavic you won't have any regrets both so are great options for drones and I will never stop being impressed and just how tiny you give me [Music]", "label": "#"}, {"data": "are you here for Casey for Casey I'll be right out hey Sean let's login more talking buddy Oh quickie at Mile Run I lost Sean at Mile - haven't seen him since sorry I was late I had to get my run in you know busy morning because at 11:00 this morning Samsung's doing their big like unboxing event so wounded out this morning then I gotta get back downtown to work they did send me a car and driver but I think this traffic's a little bit slower than the boosted boards so I'll meet you there thank you sir this is why I always have to have a boosted board with me I forgot my helmet in the back of that car one block holy Sh look at that line hey Chelsea am i late not yet [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey there good to see you very much look at this screen look I'm standing on it security told me not to come out here but look at this screen I want this in my house Hey he did a big house with that full event Samsung thanks for having me just one quick question where my note ate at you usually really good about giving me the new the new devices hey it's tomorrow it's tomorrow morning look I got one video when I went to see the total lunar no total solar eclipse it was amazing but a lot of people have been asking how did I shoot the actual scene when the Eclipse happen because I had a lot of coverage so I thought I would explain first you should know I had five cameras shooting simultaneously while the Eclipse took place two of those cameras were flying cameras first the perfect overhead shot about five minutes where the eclipse took place I sent a phantom for like this straight up in the air about 1,500 feet above the ground where I was standing camera pointed straight down like this then I set the location to lock so it wouldn't move too much and I hit record and then I just kind of forgot about a second camera the one that went over the crowd just as it got dark that was this custom Casey Neistat Mavic right here setting a trajectory on the app minute it got dark I just hit start through the controller so this thing went by itself third camera that was that wide-angle sping time-lapse shot I got that by putting a gopro hero4 on an egg timer I could Sony t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t and that's why in the last shot of the video when you see me pull this thing down you can actually hear the egg timer fourth shot that's the shot of the Sun staring directly into the Sun that was done using the camera that I'm actually filming this on right now which is a Panasonic Lumix gh2 h5 with a long lens on it and then I put a little sunglasses over the lens to create a filter and film the Sun I had to remember to lock focus and lock exposure before I hit record camera number five was like the can I talked into was like the main vlogging camera and that was this year Sony rx100 mark 5 this I use because it has the best low-light and I knew no matter how dark it got that this thing would give me like a consistent rock-solid image plus the big camera here was busy shooting the Sun and that is how one person shoots with five cameras to get five angles to capture a minute and 44 seconds of totality are you telling me that you built a time machine yeah that was Austin Texas for the South by Southwest Film Festival 2008 [Applause] it was a big day what was taking place there's my friends Josh and Benny safty that's Josh Casey Benny they made this movie I sort of helped them make it I organized the funding for it for that they bestowed me with an executive producer credits but this was us premiering the movie at a film festival for the first time how do you feel about this screening we word nerve it was it was a great movie those guys made a great we made a great movie but this was a tiny tiny theater that there weren't that many people there hey Jeffy is that look that was a really big deal for us Josh and Benny those two guys they're two of my oldest friends there are two people that have motivated and inspired me as a filmmaker my whole life I'm talking about them now because they have a huge feature-length like big time movie that's coming out in all the movie theaters this weekend that's where they started guys ready and they made it they did it their movie that comes out this weekend starts Robert Pattinson that that's huge really handsome movie star those guys did it we used to make movies together when this is what a video camera look like hey Casey say hi hey hey I'm not being paid for this or anything they're just my friends I love those guys in any promotion I could help them with I would do as if that isn't enough to celebrate who produced their new smash hit feature-length movie my dear friend Oscar Oscar is one of the first people that ever worked for my brother and me and we hired him the day after he moved to New York City when he was like 21 or something this video is him opening his Christmas presents from Van and me I know it looks like a lot of money that is like less than one week's pay those were all one dollar bills a movie is called good time directed by the sastras that's Josh and Benny produced by Oscar boysson Oscar how did you go from being my assistant to a famous big-time movie producer just by never taking no for an answer kind of following believing I could do anything which I learned in the nice dad studio alright seriously this guy would just over and over again I'd never seen anything like it you just say you're smart figure it out you're smart figure it out you're smart figure it out I don't care how long it takes just make it beautiful and that sounded a little weird at the time because you're used to work in a restaurant or being a landscaper but it's actually really empowering and it took me a while to figure that out and the more movies I made the more I realized it didn't matter it kind of applies to everything Oscar how did you get Robert Pattinson of Twilight Fame to star in this movie two years ago about two years ago today Robert Pattinson saw an image from a movie that I also produced that Josh and Benny also directed and he emailed Josh and Benny and said I want to do whatever you guys are doing next so Robert Pattinson came to you came to Josh and Danny to be in this movie or a movie yeah and Josh said be careful because when we say we're going to do something we actually do it which is not something that happens the movie business very often I want to bring up the Rotten Tomatoes oh yeah Rotten Tomatoes here Game of Thrones their movies opening this week look at this look at this look at this good time 90% that's more than all these other movies that's kind of it for my plug for good time I'll end this by saying this is not a movie for children there's gratuitous violence there's drug use there's profanity but it is the movie that the young aspiring filmmaker version of me well yeah so psyched I would have seen it and said I want to make it look like a Martin Scorsese movie from the 1970s if that means anything to you okay last detail if you are in New York City tomorrow if you're in New York City August 24th 2017 we're what are we doing like hosting a screening Oscar and I are gonna be hosting a

of Qatar Airways business class experience [Music] [Music] now I do want to say that this video is not an ad I wasn't paid or hired by this company to make it but the flight attendants didn't recognize me last time I made one of these videos and they're being extra nice to me so maybe take that into consideration let's begin by having a look at the amenities kit now in addition the amenities kid I was also given some pajamas I don't need for jobless immersion wearing pajamas but I feel like because of this video I should at least try them on [Music] from a comfort perspective cannot attend home run from a style perspective I would find a little bit of color or maybe like a big fat supreme logo but I put my clothes back on better this slides like 11 and a half hours so the entertainment system is very important looks like about a 20 inch screen or something remote here that sort of looks like an iPhone they have these cameras on the outside of the plane and you can see what's around you that's pretty cool it's like I put a GoPro up there or something impressive bar looking area behind me here I don't know what this area is for I always find planes to be really crowded I like having a little space where I can stretch out maybe do a little exercise get the blood flowing in my legs again so this feels good what are they our planes have Chin's I mean if they can put showers and bars and lounges and airplanes we can't to put a gym on it here business class menu now one thing the lady explained to me is that I can order whatever I want whatever I want there is into mealtime so a lot of options here can I have the pancakes and smoked salmon yep perfect how about a drink before that make some smoothie eat some fresh orange juice I'd like the smoothie please you know or just mix it up for me so I trust your judgment very excited about this whatever coffee we have four coffees you like a cappuccino yeah but you know a lot of days espressos decaffeinated can I have a cappuccino please like a restaurant where's this agency right thank you best thing so far is the cappuccino but the food hasn't come you see I'm not the only one who does that sir I'm not the only one who exercises on airframes the quad deep squat my foods here thank you right second course here this hasn't even my lunch yet I really know what these things are like that I also know remember we're in the soup but they brought me soup in peace good that's the core nineteen weeks [Music] thank you salmon scrambled eggs the salmon has caviar on it she's making my seat into a bed now I'm gonna go to sleep the bathroom's here they're just kind of like regular airplane bathrooms but the lighting in the mirror is sort of a nice touch that and the day also unlimited toothbrush and toothpaste it's a nice gesture body mist kind of smells like an airplane bathroom and like all they're playing bathrooms it does serve as a nice place to go when you need a little alone time all right [Music] tours of this nation doorman International Airport where wisdom in the white earlier well I guess that concludes my comprehensive review of Qatar Airways the verdict for Qatar Airways - thumbs up sailor [Music] Oh sailor sailor [Music]", "label": "G"}, {"data": "so this is not like a regular episode this is more like me sharing a story with you that I want to share with you it's not that it's like sad sad but it's not a super happy or fun story I just wanted to give you forewarning if you're expecting like a fun jubilant blog just come back tomorrow but if you want to hear this more kind of sentimental I guess a little bit a little bit sad of the story well then you're in the right place but this does start out fun it starts out being a fun episode so here okay so this was like a week ago this is before Dan left for South Africa thank you very much see you later be okay I'm just leaving town and I thought maybe I should bring you something is it donuts it's better ah dude get well then I'll see you in a couple of days so today is a road trip day I've got a very very long like what is it six-hour leave six hour and 32 minute drive from New York City up to Vermont where my grandmother is not funeral funeral is instead of a funeral she's having the whole family get together to celebrate her life and there's gonna be like 30 or 40 of us there so I'm sad but I'm also very excited to see my family when I'm not excited about is this dry it's kind of a bummer that Franny and Candice didn't come I understand why they didn't want to sit in the car for seven hours it was smart Candice's it's too pregnant way too pregnant to be in the car and then nobody I didn't have anybody else to go with me so today is a day of solidarity focused in and sitting in my car watching it drive me to Vermont there it is so now I've got about 40 half an hour 40 minutes to kill the shopping mall actually I'm buying a tie for the funeral I'd neglected to bring one so this is fortuitous stop [Music] quick bite to eat now I think the car is probably close to charge I'm back in the car getting it washed I got a full tank of battery I've got I had a food I'm good I'm ready to drop is awesome I'm ready to drive there is one tiny little concern though it is way way further than I thought I mean not like a little bit for the like significantly as in it's 9 o'clock at night I've been driving with traffic like six hours I'm not even halfway there long story long I got a long long night of driving ahead of me [Music] that was kind of all I shot of the whole weekend of getting there see I got to the hotel where my family my whole extended family was staying we got there like 1:00 in the morning I saw my sister we shared a room and I just I decided at that moment that I wanted this trip to be just like purely about being present and being around my family it felt especially relevant because we were there to sort of celebrate the life of my grandmother but I just I didn't pick the camera up again until I left [Music] that's my sister there that's me and my sister so the reason why I wanted to make this video or just what I kind of wanted to share for posterity was my take away from this whole from the whole funeral from the whole family get together see we woke up the next morning if we went to the cemetery in the whole sad part and then and then that night we had this is the night of the funeral we had this big like dinner get together in a room it's sort of like a wedding reception is what it felt like and after we all finished our lasagna one after another my aunts and my uncles and my cousins they all kind of started to stand up and tell stories about my grandmother that's my grandmother and that that's my grandfather that's my mom and that's her mom my grandmother my grandmother my Nana kept a journal of every day of her life and so many your stories shared from my aunts and uncles were directly from that journal they could go back to literally any day in her life and and recall what happened that's my that's my that's my grandmother that's my uncle I'm not sure which one am i laughter that is that's me again my mom her side of the family my maternal side of the family I had eight aunts and uncles or seven Anse and uncles in one mom so my mother is one of eight kids these are them that's seven of them anyways I think that's my mom right there that's my uncle my uncle yeah I I knew that they struggled like my mom always talked to us about how they had powdered milk when they were kids because they couldn't afford like regular milk that comes in a jug they would buy powder and mix it with water and that was the milk that they got [Music] then my aunt started reading off journal entries and there was a couple that were short and there's a couple that were like I went to bed hungry tonight because we all the kids ate because we only had enough food for the kids or there was one that was something like feeling terrible I didn't have enough food for Lee that was her husband my grandfather maybe tomorrow will be different there were there were a lot of those kinds of moments that just painted such a vivid portrait of what of what my grandmother's life was like like raising eight kids and it's hard for me to imagine this whatever was 50 years ago 60 years ago but it just that night there would the family made it so real and so palpable I don't know it's weird I was felt more affected by my grandmother than in those moments that I did in my whole life of knowing her and physically being around her [Music] the model my dad and my brother and cousins and no no no that guy is cousin cousin and cousin there's Nana right there that's me with my cousins and my brothers this is where I lived in a in a trailer park see I live like I think I think right there and that's my grandmother that's my mom that's my dad that's me and that's my baby boy Owen he's big now but that's always [Music] I know I got up to say something I didn't have a fun anecdote from my grandmother's life but when I stood up I just wanted to thank her and acknowledge how special of a thing it was that her the last thing she did on earth before she died was to set aside the money and the resources and everything to have the whole family come together like this amazing trip was her doing and what a special special thing that was to have to have to have us remember her by it was special [Applause] [Music] [Music] well I made it back great trip of really just amazing time with the family [Music] [Music] [Music]", "label": "G"}, {"data": "[Applause] welcome to John's spooky kitchen just came up with that name right now that's how good I am wasn't planned you can't compete with that check out that social blade hey just like one of them guys at Benihana you know those fans you know I've been thinking recently and frankly I got a little teed off excuse the language cuz I was thinking Thanksgivings got a festive holiday food we roast a turkey for Thanksgiving Christmas you got the holiday ham well you got for Halloween nothing what do you do smelt candy corn down into a liquid viscous gold so I decided to come up with my own food that'll be perfect for the Halloween season that's right ladies and gentlemen today we're gonna be cooking a turducken Oh what's the turn up you ask well well obviously that's a chicken inside of a duck inside of a turkey [Music] it's the Frankenstein of foods really borderline unethical okay by the way you might be thinking John how'd you devise that well I didn't that one comes out Paula Dean go right on Food Network Paula's just smile it away but I tell you what the turkey chicken and duck probably aren't true story this is a dish so vile that PETA video condemning it yet hello the Internet today we're going to make a vegan version of a turducken or as it's also known a tofu in a turducken is a chicken stuffed inside a duck stuffed inside a turkey which is probably the grossest I've ever heard of usually eaten by simple eggs that's one bad recipe if you got grandma cursing up a storm over it so now I with literally zero training I'm about to try to cook this thing as you can see the level is advanced baby I burn eggs prep time 30 minutes total 13 hours all right here we go step one the chicken free bird all right let's I have no idea what I'm doing oh she's beautiful I know people are gonna make fun of me cuz they're like what you've never debone a chicken before is that part of the procedures as a maxi pad she was on the rag before she hit the slaughterhouse this just shows how either incompetent my generation or me is so the trick the trick to turducken is you have to get you have to debone this basically so we have to make an incision here yeah who needs these yeah there goes that was I supposed to get rid of the wing well I have well I have okay not so bad not so bad I'm supposed to get that thing right that whole middle out but keep the rest intact now I know this is true but you see the method of doing so is the is the part that I don't understand something about there's a bone here a joint and I'm not a doctor but I think that's what I'm dealing with okay I was I was more scared than the chicken I'm dealing with oh I've sliced myself can you get salmonella in the bloodstream I think I've got the hang of this now there it goes there it goes oh I actually got this anyways there's that she's gone it's gone that is gone whatever is I don't care there we go

insistence [Music] that's his dinner last night and I ran into a friend of mine and this woman there she told me that her son has been vlogging he's young that he's been vlogging in kids at school have been making fun of him because he's making YouTube videos heard that from like uh from a young person the Twilight he was 12 or 13 years old and he was making YouTube videos he also well his parents also told me he was getting teased at school because he made YouTube videos god that just pisses me off [Music] I want to kick off today's episode with a message directly to you twelve-year-old kid who's getting teased at school because you make youtube videos let me explain a truth bear with me here this is for everyone this is for everyone who's trying to do something that they believe in and some is discouraging them against okay ready this line here this line is you over here is now and here is when you succeed now they're gonna tease you now they're gonna tease you now because you don't have success just yet then you're gonna succeed and they'll want to be these are the two phases that will happen by the doubters and by the haters and in between they're scared of you so in those kids at school are picking on you no it's because they're scared of you so they tease you because they know when you succeed they're gonna want to be you now you down here in between now and when you achieve success there there are two things two things that you should be doing and that is to persevere and be determined perseverance I will continue my pursuit no matter the opposition you can tease me you can pick on me you can call me a loser you can be like my friends parents like back in high school and I had a dropout is that a kid to take care of and they looked at me in the Caza Loser and they rolled their eyes at me and they didn't what their kids that hang out me because I was the loser I didn't care I persevered I continued my pursuit determination I will stop at nothing to achieve my goal you are determined and you will stop at nothing so the kids in school are picking on the kids that wanna make youtube videos teasing somebody for doing something that they're passionate about how dare you God get me all riled up at the start of the vlog got some exciting stuff coming in this episode [Applause] that's a big night wait it's kind of a big night but believe it or not I'm running horribly late really have time to dress up properly I'm just gonna kinda throw a little something together [Music] so I'm on my way to the 8th annual or 6th annual or 10th annual or something annual shorty awards the shorter I've been to the Oscars and the Grammys the MTV Music Award but there's a special place in my heart for the Shorty Awards because they celebrate youtubers and snapchatters and social media creators which which have as much cultural impact as people in the movies the people on TV but don't get anywhere near the recognition so I love the Shorty Awards [Music] hi thank you bye Christina have I mentioned lately just how much I love New York City because I really love New York City [Music] I don't love that Midtown traffic though Oh sorry I'm late no worries Helen just started right now so I haven't actually missed anything yet right you have not missed anything I mean any of my duties you've done this any of your duties here toward the end of the show all right you look great dropped off all my stuff fixed my tie [Music] producing green means on a letter our Facebook Tumblr YouTube snapchat you now usually their nominee

went it's also a lot of fun being in Times Square at night [Music]", "label": "G"}, {"data": "[Applause] Hey hey did you finish the tech Tuesday intro I need it for today's episode [Music] drones drones drones drones drones drones drones when you talk about drones you really talk about one brand and that one brand is DJI [Music] pji just dominates the market with hit drones like the spark and the Mavic air and me when consumers youtubers people like me think of buying a drone this is what's generally thought of and that's despite there being a number of interesting competitors that have come to the market like the GoPro drone which is an interesting device because it was dynamic you could take the camera out and mount it on your chest then there are other devices like like this sky do drone which is a start up their tracking technology is amazing but difficult to justify several thousand dollars when for several hundred dollars you can get one of these which which in a lot of ways is superior to the several thousand dollar one but just today I received a drone in the mail from a company I had never heard from the drone company I'd never heard of and they pitched it to me as a DJI competitor this this is the GD uo2 drone let's unbox [Music] I'm waiting for the battery to charge some initial thoughts on the GDU o2 now when you open the box you're greeted by these two things the controller and the drone it feels a little cheap but I know better than to judge a book by its cover you have 4k video obstacle avoidance 20 minutes of flight time just sort of what's expected from a small drone okay alright enough yapping go test this thing where there's a safe place to fly these things that stand behind me Sam is a tech aficionado and it's here to consult on whether this GDU - is worth the damn or not yeah better is that better alright so I'm not gonna do any big sweeping dramatic shots because I don't think you're supposed to out here better do a low flight and really focus on testing two things that is flight control how easy is it to fly in an image quality how pretty is the picture that it yields before I send this in the air one quick comparison with the Maverick air just uh both folding drones alright I'm going to start with the Mavic air as sort of a controls who have something to compare the GDU o2 to [Music] [Applause] [Music] nicely done okay here we go this is the takeoff of the DD you see a man quality doesn't look bad based on what I'm seeing on the phone the flight control though is very wishy-washy it feels like what try to DJ I was several years ago on top of that there's major connection issues I can see the drone it's about 60 feet from me yet I've lost connectivity three times it's a big deal when you're flying these drones [Music] I lost it I watched it crash like right over there there was no control what so it did you see it I watched you just did a dive bomb I mean it was you know I'm only flying about 10 15 feet over the water here for safety and I'm fly over the water to be saved and the thing just we see if we can get it I'd see it make together he gets gone did you see it he's got a poor one out for that drone did you see it though father and son say they heard it and just hit the water and that's kind of it it's in the water what are you laughing how much of you my review now I'm no expert drone pilot I've crashed more drones and I've successfully flown but this was really basic flight and the thing just took off you saw I watched it just zipped and then just went just heal and then that was the end of that no sign of it before I sent the drone up in the air I said to camera image quality and flight controls are what I'd be testing and the failure that was the GDU tests flight I think is solely to blame on the flight control itself flight control by the way is like this software it's what how you interact with the drone as it's fly when you pilot a drone you're like operating a vehicle that is up in the air and any sense of disconnection is like so nerve-racking for me there's so many things that can go wrong and today was one of those days I'm mostly just frustrated cuz I don't even know if I can call this a tech review I don't have the footage from the drift out of today guru welcome Dan good to see you and I don't even know if I can call us a tech review because I don't have the footage to compare against the other what happened I hate to give like a really strong negative review about something but why would you spend the same amount of money on something that's that's an inferior product all the way around went for the same dollar amount you could get something that is superior on all levels DJ I'm DJ I doesn't pay me I just think they make great products I want to do a test with some so that you know that did you see yesterday's video where um look it's literally called instant regret why would you do this it's got six point four million on the scoville scale I don't want to do this right now - no you did you eat - I ate two of them you did eat - I may - if you you can eat I'm going to write this do it do it come on choo choo choo choo choo choo dude he's tough he's touch he made it something is such a big deal watch it watch it go happily it's like I'm not gonna cry it's like the hottest Kyle I can't even talk dude it hurts man youtube.com slash youtube.com slash Sam Shepard I'll see you there good luck Sam", "label": "G"}, {"data": "that was in uh I was in a I was in Denver Colorado yesterday man what an incredible city that is [Music] alright Denver Colorado it's freezing great to be here dart I I love this thing this is why I'm here for Denver startup week I'm speaking at I'm speaking at Denver startup week entrepreneurs small businesses a lot of excited people amazing event but Denver Denver's one of those cities that I could see myself living in it's it's incredible here ok I got a small problem a small problem I'd like to discuss with you in the spring of 2015 in one of the early episodes of season 1 of the vlog I opened a package on camera it's our new coffee machine and this began mail time this is a really funny book by the way couple years it all falls into one of two categories first category is companies small companies big companies companies like shred lights they're sending me free products like lights cuz they want me to talk about their company and what their products are the second kind of mail that I get and this is my favorite my favorite kind of mail are just like packages and letters from people we're just writing to say hi and like and cool stuff like that and sometimes they send me really cool stuff too now here's the problem the problem is I've just got I've got too much stuff look at normally this is a couch here this is where I have meetings is on my couch there's no couch there's just boxes and then more boxes and then more boxes and more boxes and these boxes all these boxes here in my studio right now this is just like from like this weekend last weekend whatever I have a whole nother studio where my office manager Patrick works right there and then my friend Sam shares his space this is his desk but primarily what this entire space is used for is what's on the upper level here and well now now this and I mean all of this stuff here all this stuff this is all stuff that people have sent me over the years and I mean like everything up here is perfectly meticulously organized like skateboards look at look at these skateboards look at this skateboard it's got me on it that's incredible how about a complete skateboard here's a complete skateboard tiny skateboard tinier skateboard big skateboard bigger skateboard skateboard that's shaped like a surfboard funny shaped skateboard but my skateboard rattling hold for skateboards and I have four skateboards in fact in fact I had to build a little thing on top of my umbrella holder here to hold one two more skateboards I need a spot for my little skateboards something someone made for me put it Tyla trees toys shoes clothing light bulbs more shoes pillows blankets and bags but look I have a second a second pillows and blankets been over here blankets pillows cups and posters lilies cups how about a helmet jacket or backpack a mattress television these garbage bags are completely filled up with clothing like t-shirts and hats and sweaters and pants Andy thank you for sending me this shirt really well-designed I really appreciate it I literally have 75 t-shirts at home then two garbage bags over here filled up with unworn t-shirts I don't know what to do with all these t-shirts there are 100 comments below they're like Casey you ungrateful mother fine people sent you that stuff you should show some appreciation I appreciate it immensely and please know that every single person who sends me anything whether it's a one of these letters in the box or somebody sends me a big present or a small present or just a note that says hello every single person gets a response I send everybody stickers and then see all of these up here those are my binders where I save your letters I catalog them I date them and then I put them up there for reference for all of eternity I appreciate every single thing that's ever been sent to me but I still find myself in a position of extreme abundance to have an abundance of food and snacks because I eat all the candy and then whatever weird stuff that I don't want I just give to Oscar hey hey man is Oscar in so I find myself in this position of trying to figure out what to do with all of this stuff and you know living in New York City space is a premium here and it's like I don't want to get rid of anything because I appreciate it so much for the same time it's just kind of sitting in my office over there that I'm paying rent on that's collecting dust so what should I do is the million dollar here Casey we know you like skateboards two guys grew up in Hawaii this is a five foot tall skateboard and it's awesome and I appreciate it and thank you I just don't know where to put it [Music] as come on now in the past I have donated some of the toys to charities who give toys to kids I've donated a bunch of the clothes to places where you can donate clothing and then what I really like to do is when somebody I know or sort of know needs something I just send them all this extra stuff okay seen I said and told him about my nonprofit heroes reading heroes Tomasz blown up hashtag grenade legs I'm gonna share with you the goodies mr. nice that decided to send me Chris was a US soldier knee at his legs blown up in Iraq he wants to make youtube videos but isn't have any camera gear so I sent him a whole box of stuff and a lot of that stuff and a lot of it was stuff that people had sent me that I wasn't using so I was able to pass on to him so I'm looking for something that's more scalable that does something good that here's what I came up with all right so here here's the plan I'm going to be launching an eBay store do you call an eBay store an eBay I'm gonna sell everything that everyone's ever sent me that I don't have a use for or someone else I can give it to then I'm gonna take all those proceeds and I mean every penny like every cent that's leftover that we didn't use on shipping every cent and I'm gonna give it all to whatever nonprofit I feel needs it the most at any given the current situation I have too much male stuff the answer the current situation is to store all the stuff in garbage bags this accomplishes absolutely nothing now the new way current situation the same too much male stuff but the answer is to sell it on ebay what does this accomplish well the stuff this stuff goes to people who will actually use it instead of just store it like me and then the proceeds the proceeds will help those in the most need via charities and things like that so for this first run of stuff that I'm going to sell all the proceeds for that are gonna go to a couple of charities all linked below all of which are currently helping people in Puerto Rico just ravaged by a hurricane three plus million people without power down there they're in the most need right now so I'm going to donate all the cash made from selling all this stuff to help those people I hope this doesn't discourage anyone from sending me anything I do appreciate the mail I try to open as much as I can on camera and I especially appreciate the gadget because it gives me like good content we need to review gadgets like whatever this thing is now I'm gonna pivot this episode for me talking about male solutions to a tech review of [Music] number one motorized bicycle look at this well well so far I like it a lot [Applause] [Music] hey Mira Vasco da Stern yeah can you come test this electric bike with me of course yeah do you want to ride this for the skateboard [Music] hey old life expectations Oscar I mean based on the hallway test I think we're I'm excited to see how this thing goes on the outside so what folds up yeah I don't know much about I couldn't find the manual top speed don't know it's turning ability supply oh geez I guess the question becomes Oscar could you see this as a viable means of transportation in New York City I feel vulnerable on it I feel a little anxious about hurting someone else for the right kind of person you know if you're maybe not is like you don't enjoy the exercise that comes along with a bike it might work [Music] my biggest beef is there's nowhere to put your feet I think that's what this is for your feet are supposed to go here but they don't really organically fall there let's look at some of the features of this thing the center stand here telescoping foot pads or disc brakes yup front disc brake seat there is suspension up front LED display here new york sides it's something you could've in your apartment I mean if I look half as cool as I feel Oscar this thing seems like a home run how I always imagined you [Music] I think we're really asserting some street presence the amazing have a street gang with like a dozen of us and leathers and chaps you know I do he's proud to see the horn everybody yields I found a weakness it's up no power thanks a lot you like this one [Music] this is a steal ability deal ability test alright go no problem dude alright so all in all the review of the hover 1 bicycle is that it's pretty good I don't know what this costs are what the range is but by the time I edit this I will have googled it and I'll put it right here on the screen for me it's still tough that anything that they can compare with the boosted board also always wear a helmet also I'll see you tomorrow here on the block [Music]", "label": "G"}, {"data": "650 or in the morning at $TIME today is my last day it's the last day of this road trip but it's also my last day with my son before I

bear with that I hope you can understand this is a tough tough thing for me I hope someday you get to experience something like this yeah", "label": "G"}, {"data": "[Music] seems like a nice enough cop here's his cruiser but he's gonna like give me a proper summons I'm gonna try my best to talk him out of it but I have a feeling [Music] [Applause] so this is the spot where I got the ticket yesterday and while I was ticketed for wearing headphones which is just the reason why the police officer stopped me and stopped the other cyclists I think was unfair and rather than spending four hours going to court to deal with it I'm gonna spend those four hours making a video to explain why I think it was unfair [Music] [Applause] now why'd the police officer stop me as I was coming down the way his Berg bridge here when I got to the bottom of the bridge I went straight I went straight through this little passageway right here that is not allowed this little hole that was the point of conflict for this whole thing it's a one-way passage way meaning cyclists are only allowed to come through it in this direction not in this direction and that is defined by this sign here that says wrong way if we could go through over here and not hit this construction on all that that'd be one thing if they gave us a separate route but they don't see when you're riding your bike down the waves for bridge and you get the bottom y'all sense if we have three options turn left turn right or go straight [Music] the rule breaker watch this cyclist you see that that was a that was an example of the problem when you're coming down when you're cycling down this bridge it's intuitive to think you can go straight there's clearly a left turn there's clearly a right turn and then because of the fact that this street here Delancey Street is a two-way Road obviously the bike paths would have two different lanes for two different directions of traffic that's not the case that's where it's very counterintuitive why is there not to me it just makes sense you've got it's a flow it's a guess no come down there's straight on real easy safe don't have to worry about anything you see everyone it's hard trying to make this turn here with people walk in and your people cross in but I've seen people pulled over here it's a shitty thing [Music] I would like to criticize the architect or city planner who designed this really counterintuitive somewhat nonsensical traffic system for cyclists here now to me these arrows say traffic goes in this direction which directly contradicts the wrong-way sign the police officer who was a total gentleman and very respectful the police officer explained that yesterday someone was was hit by a cyclist that came through this exact way that's why he was out ticketing people and it was that premise that made me want to make this video because because the public safety is the concern well then I think that's fantastic so here's a simple solution that I suggested the city of New York instead of harassing and fining cyclists like myself how about this what is really here for traffic going in this direction another here for traffic going in that direction that way the traffic eastbound and westbound will be delineated the same way it is for for cars here or the way it is for cyclists on the bridge watch this guy it's just not intuitive to stop you don't know you can't even read these signs watch the stuff now how are we supposed to learn any harder dollars [Music] and lastly I just want the sea to know that I paid the paid the summons I say you to check that's it beautiful braids [Music] because cyclists don't follow the law like they're supposed to pop that guy just went through a red light do you see the Motor Vehicles going through the red light no you don't cyclist is supposed to stop for the red light no I understand I would just all right I would just say that these laws aren't as clear I'm a law-abiding guy I'm just saying it's not clearly labeled I lived here forever got six people here", "label": "G"}, {"data": "duh when I was a kid I wanted to be a filmmaker to me there was no higher artistic achievement than that I watched movies all the time I watched all the movies I bought this book and the Oscars the Oscars were my Superboy would I wear what I say what'd I do Roberto Benigni Pulis Ali feel the played straight like Hanks thank you but more than anything I just wanted to make great they were warned to be cameras not one of the big crew under I wanted to work with the best actors I wanted to read the best strip crane location I want you to all of the one to be the version of the filmmaker that I thought was the only version of the filmmaker ones with the fucking bow ties that's what I thought it meant to tell stories see if you want to be a writer all you need is a stack of paper and a pencil you want to be a painter you need a brush and canvas you can be the next Picasso but when I was a teenager my filmmaking fantasies were at their peak you wanted to be a filmmaker need a resources Italy if that's the right in order to make movies needed all those things all those things I didn't have filmmaking was this exclusive club it was for the chosen few maybe maybe I have to find something else to do with my life but this this was my dream but there's one thing I know about dreams that to achieve them you have to stop at nothing so I spent 10 years chasing it down I said yes to every opportunity that involve picking up a camera bar mitzva videos wedding videos birthday be blind is not glamorous and this is the trailer I used to live in right there but I would not I could not give up I went to camp with I got into something with my own TV show on HBO I got my name on movie posters I got the badges I got all the T's and cross all the eyes of what it meant to be a traditional film if all these people are here to see Theory achieve my dream it didn't feel like I realized the dream it felt like I'd fit myself into somebody else's version of the dream and then I was on an airplane and I realized this isn't it this isn't why I wanted to be [Music] it wasn't the red carpet it wasn't the Film Festival's it wasn't the Awards it wasn't the award shows that shit the more time I spent chasing down the facade of success the less creating I was actually doing how can I go back [Music] in fact it was after winning the biggest award of my career that I just said bucket I just want to make internet videos I'm going to make a movie every day a proper and daily blog I'm just assignment now we live in the future and chances are there's a camera in your pocket that's giving up the big screen but you don't need the big screen 200 people might show up in a movie theater so put it online million find an art in a smaller slightly less small audience find your audience tell your story start a conversation get that idea out of your head and into video knit make it yet

I really only function well when I have a tight deadline obviously I've had a video in my head for a really long time the video that I made for for YouTube called do what you can't do what you can't I had a part two to that and the idea behind it is like to celebrate the fact that anyone and everyone can be a filmmaker now because of technology and like our phones and YouTube anyone can be a creator and I want to make a movie that speaks to that a much better editor than I am we're working on this movie together it's like 40% done deadlines and procrastination okay let's get back to work [Music] that's not blood it's paint this is like for an animation for the movie that we are still that we're still working on we're like 15 hours away from deadline it's coming along we're just coming along slowly she is far more confident than I am which is good because she's the one in the driver's seat [Music] fine good luck tonight I gotta say I'm really really happy that the running thing turned out okay I know that seem like like the best-case scenario just worked out but it was a it did and I'm thankful but it was a big deal for me we're probably gonna make our deadline and good news on the running [Music]", "label": "G"}, {"data": "[Music] summer is the season in between spring and fall it occurs when the Earth on its axis tilts in the direction of the Sun resulting in longer hotter days this summer is 93 days 15 hours and 38 minutes long summer is short summer is special and today is the very first day of summer in honor of making the most out of summer this video is going to be me trying to live out a stupid teenage fantasy it starts at some ridiculous hotel in the south of France the hotel has an amazing shower you can tell everything you need to know about a hotel by its shower it also involves room service lots of room service co-stars my friend Jesse is a great dancer there was this fantasy car but this this was nice but this wasn't it the problem with our driver's licenses because neither a tablet so we had to get this car instead oh all right back to the video and the less cool far this summer fantasy it's something like James Bond jay-z's but again the part wasn't right it's cut be sorry for the interruptions in this we're taking this car back we're losing this part we're gonna drop the whole car scene as hard decision it's not matching the vibe that we're doing the colors back in play we got we got vanilla we got Iowa heritage [Music] next porky see I spend the rest of the year waiting for and wanting summer some has always been a time when I'm in a bathing suit all day kind of look like two dorks some has always been magical it's never been like this but I've always imagined something like this that's all yeah a guy can dream you and you're too close and the girls are too far Tyla come on I mean this is a hard shoot case I don't know how we're gonna make it my favorite favorite part of the production thus far yeah we had a huge boat I don't think we could make a video like this unless you had a type of boat it's the South of France would you expect come on this is my childhood fantasy just go with it [Music] [Music] now I'll be the first to recognize this is not the most original fantasy in the world I mean look at us we're like wannabe rock stars who just got our first advance but that's summer I think summer is the will reminding us to get outside and live a little okay you're driving now [Applause] it's not necessarily about realizing absurd childhood ambitions but it is about having fun and being free to play and enjoying every damn minute [Applause] [Music] my twelve year old self smells a lot to learn but summer leave that without a crazy hotel room a big boat jet skis or that car we never drove it's about the spirit it's about being alive you've got to make the most out of every moment don't worry you can sleep in September [Music] the time it's only 10:00 p.m. come on come on Casey sister make

up the street getting to you what I think of the greatest days in my entire life I think of when my children were born or perhaps when my son graduated high school or today when I was upgraded from business to first pot emirates I don't know what I did to deserve this i really dont snacks writing kit in the air just left by doors like my old house over here total privacy yeah the TV years

I'll deal the journey showering on an airplane I've been 30 minutes here to go to I got five minutes of running water in the shower give me 25 other minutes that's a real working dreams do come true I

traveling and set up being a terrible experience goes from pain meet fault fish", "label": "G"}, {"data": "do you look cold on its ever do you look like a nerd I think you look like a badass dude [Music] [Music] a lot of people have been asking about my bike so let's talk about my bike [Music] today's tick review cheese never advised me to travel back in time I've always sought means of transportation that are different from likes public transportations subways too noisy and crowded buses are too slow calves are too expensive drying is impractical walking this doesn't cover enough distance now if you've watched this vlog you know that my favorite means of transport are my boosted boards so I have so many of them a couple weeks ago I got one of these bikes it's called the super 73 and it's really really interesting a little history on the super 73 the parent companies called lithium cycles and they launched as a Kickstarter in 2016 they started shipping these bikes I want to say in early 2017 or late 2016 it's a very cool company they work with a lot of youtubers and they sent me two bikes one for Candice and one for me kind of thought I'd be like a joke that would sit in the corner of my office this thing's kind of taken over and it's the first means of transport in New York City in whatever 2 or 3 years that has started to make inroads competing with my boosted board for my favorite way to get around and now a closer look at the bike [Music] right before Dan and I can actually shoot the out in the street version of this I have to have Sam teach me how to use the stabilizer and this all that totally said one secret stabilizer package for mr. nice dad yeah it holds the ATD with like the super small lenses it's really useful you think you can handle it I don't know I'm scared of like riding and shooting but it holds the camera really well yeah sort of like a double tap are you Tuesday you mount it on the bottom here and then there's a bunch of different axes to balance locked and twisted ready to go so it's neat is if you want to get the super low drop down shot you turn it over like this and then you can like really get super low to the ground and this is like ultra ultra stable shots yeah [Music] riding a regular boat gotta watch out for potholes yeah be careful of cars gotta be up guys gotta be mindful of the handlebars sitting in between other car most importantly you have to obey traffic laws [Music] so this thing at three what is this we're just pedaling like a madman it's not bad but it's kind of a heavy bike to just pedal number two number two something called pedal assist and basically what that means is after you pedal the motor are you doing as you pedal the motor picks up and takes off for you it's like you have super muscled superhuman superhero power and your legs like watch I'm totally white already watch me take off later [Music] and in the lifeboat [Music] survive [Music] [Music] one advantage this thing has over other electric bikes and bikes in general is it can handle off-roading like grass dirt gravel really well ready [Music] so there's a lot to like about this and and the reason why I think that this thing is kind of brought bikes back into my life in New York City is just cuz of how dynamic it is I put that milk crate on the back so now I can haul a bunch of things the range on its further than my skateboard it's faster than a regular bicycle I don't get all sweaty I do feel a little bit safer on a bike that I do on a skateboard but there are concerns with riding an electric bike in a city like New York for example up until a month ago electric bikes were completely outlawed did you know that it wasn't like as in January they completely out as of October of last year mayor de Blasio mayor of New York City said no more power-assist no more electric bikes so if cops saw you on a bike like that they immediately take the bike away and they give you an up to a $500 fine now as of April 8th of this year like five weeks yes about a month ago exactly actually to the day a month ago exactly today the mayor announced that that he's pulling that back and now bikes are okay if they're power-assist as in they pedal as well which this does so once again this bike is legal but these are kind of the concerns when you're on something that looks like that instead of a traditional bicycle but there is one factor that the super 73 has and maybe just as new but the fun factor I think is higher on this bike than maybe any other vehicle ever ridden in the city would would you agree it's so much fun it's so much fun [Music] one thing you consider though if you live in a city and you have a bike like this is if you leave it outside it's going to get stolen so you gotta take it in [Music] and that's what's required to get this thing into my office uh it's the last question ever so I guess the last it my overexposed it's just so harsh Oh perfect perfect perfect dude the big question Arizona asked is how much of these things and they are right around two grand they have a couple of different versions to get but they start below two grand they go over two grand that's that's expensive it's a lot of money for an electric bike but if you start to compare them to other high quality electric bikes it's kind of in the sweet spot there are certainly bikes that are more expensive and they're definitely having low quality bikes that are less expensive and that's kind of it on the super 73 one thing that I will say is this company seems you're doing a lot of work with YouTube creators I love that Sam here has done a video Sam here send it wide Sam here has done a video it's super 73 she was subscribed to Sam by the way you helped me make this video Jesse who else is done Jesse's worked with super 73 you work with so they just gave me this bike super 73 if you want to work with me more formally I'd love to do something love your product but it seems like a great company it's an American start-up these things are designed in California and I gotta say for for if you're in the market for an electric bike is non-traditional as this is because most of like they look like regular bikes this is like a your yeah this thing's pretty amazing and I have to say Summer 2018 this is probably gonna be my main ride right I'm with it it's so much better ride alright that's it for our 360 I'll see you tomorrow I rode my bicycle past your window last night I roller skated to your door at daylight [Music]", "label": "G"}, {"data": "hello today is October 24th 2018 and for usual I am shooting this video in my studio in downtown Manhattan in New York City what's not usual is what happened will happen in a few places but what happened in New York City this morning Mary and Chris we all just got alerts on our phone telling everyone in the area of 58th and 8th to shelter in place immediately take a look behind me you can see 58 is actually blocked off at ninth Avenue NYPD officers SWAT teams state police all here on scene working to contain the situation there was a bomb discovered this morning at the CN n offices which is in the Time Warner building in midtown here in New York City important detail no one was injured the NYPD great job bomb squad great job happy to hear that a lot of my former colleagues and and friends are at CNN so you can hear me was also and to turn on the TV all the news channels they're running this story just over and over and then if you look at news online like this is the New York Times on Fox talks about a bomb CNN even on BBC which is a more of a global news source top item there is about an explosive and an explosive being sent to New York City and pretty usual they talked about the resilience of New Yorkers that it's still business as usual here in the city of New York so I want to make a little video that's what this is showing you you know people at home people watch this YouTube channel from all around the country and all around the world to show you what it's like actually to be here in New York City as a denizen of the city as someone who lives here you look at it on TV it feels like that the whole city's standing still and everything's stopped because of this like really terrible incident but what's it actually like here I want to make very clear that the people in New York City will not be intimidated that we are going to go about our lives undeterred because the very concept of terrorism is to change us and we will not allow that to happen this is Manhattan now my studio my office is down here in downtown Manhattan the incident took place in midtown here right at 59th Street do you know what happened this morning at the CN n building in Midtown no I think I just got like a notification on my like service alert thing was that there was like a thing that the bomb squad picked up yes yeah I just found out about have you noticed anything like different in the city because of that incident no okay well like we just found out on the train and everyone like got the little notifications on but it was kind of like whatever because we get that all the time for like Amber Alerts I haven't noticed anything have you know [Music] you cannot be terrorized if you refuse to allow the terrorists to win people the city have shown time and again that they stand up in the face of these efforts to intimidate do you know where happened this morning I like I live around there and I got at work amberle er which scared me why I'm not sure there was like type that happened yeah I'm trying to make a movie like what's it like to be in the city on something like that happen Stano is anything any changes would people the city at large when something like that takes place well being new newly moved here and when I found that out in the workplace I saw a shift and everyone's demeanor I think it put everyone in a really sick to their belly feeling and it scared me especially as someone that's new to the this is 53rd and 7th this is about six block seven blocks from where the incident took place this morning I wouldn't know who looking around that anything that today's different from any other day here in here in midtown Manhattan open a block closer so I'm gonna get a little closer and see what I can see there is an increased police presence here but I'm like a block away from the Time Warner building oh yeah have you noticed anything different in the city today because of what happened this morning um well there's a lot of police and like a lot of like you know what happened no there was an explosive device found and that's my mobility oh my god with a block there it's really important at a moment like this to remember the vast majority of Americans the vast majority of New Yorkers are good people trying to live in peace with each other [Music] what I heard they say something like some bomb triggers like my dad when something like this happens do you notice any difference in the way the city operates people is gonna be this typical New York response would just be I'm late for work my boss doesn't care we have to get to work or we have to get where to happen this morning and even this close to it I talked to a lot of people walking by and there's two schools of thought I know what happened and I don't care I've got to live my life and I don't know what happened and I don't care I have to live my life it's the reality it's the world that we live in so people just gonna keep going on people gonna be vigilant but you know we're gonna be vigilant but everyone's gonna keep going you know doesn't stop in the office [Music] on the news and it feels like a huge global event it is and this isn't to undercut the significance of what happened but to really underscore the resilience of people in New York City the city just keeps going no matter what happens are the reason why I love it here so much what they are trying to do is scare us and destabilize us and we will not allow that to happen we are New Yorkers we are smart we are tough we are resilient and we will not allow these terrorist bugs to change the way we live our lives", "label": "G"}, {"data": "What's up my fellow bros?

Dan encasing that you're sitting kinda close yeah I thought this was love story alright so Dan first appeared in like episode the first episodes of 3 6 8 and there are a lot of questions as to where he came from although your accent kinda know people have said they like my New Zealand accent other people think I'm from Australia I had some really strange runs alright so yeah this is the story of how Dan and I know each other Dan's from Cape Town South Africa my wife is South African so we usually go to Cape Town to see your family at least once a year where are you going surfing Muizenberg God so you must have seen like on my profile or something I must have been had a surfing photo or something and that's where the whole shark thing began good to see you if it seemed a bit great white sharks Thanks no joke there's a big like shark sign that day when we went out and there's a black flag I didn't know him and he's like watch out for the Sharks watch out for the Sharks it looks like there'd be sharks lurking around no I don't know what does that mean we went surfing in South Africa it was a good time but I was invited there to speak at this like really fancy it's a big deal right that's a big it's out like biggest creative I was I was there to speak of this big create event and they gave me this super fancy super posh hotel room I like Dan and I was like dude I had this sweet hotel room if you want to bring your girlfriend there to stay the night is like a thing you know I'm not using it and he was like sure and I was like here's the card just whatever you do don't make a fuss at the door I I got it so I got into a massive fight with my girlfriend at the time then long story short I ended up running away from her dad in her house and I jumped over the fence and I broke my foot and then I phoned you and I was like dude do you think I can still go to the photo room so to try and apologize to her I put on a tuxedo with no shoe cuz I had my broken foot and I was like dragging it through the bottom of the hotel and I was like I'm coming in and they were like no you not and I was like no but I know Casey Neistat and then eventually I got into the room but it caused a massive big problem and I actually never ended up getting back together with that it goes yeah so that's that hope that was like the first time we met it was it was entirely a scene movie hangover yeah yeah this feels like my life you know I was in jail once what that doesn't have anything to do with this what do you mean jail in Africa in Bali no in two islands west of Bali in Indonesia in India I got jugs planted on me it was just like that was when I was 18 that was ten years ago and it like how much time did you spend in Indonesian jail a couple of days really we broke out Bri we we

monkey shirt Sean greetings from the United States on camera Tyler thank you for sending me this letter and thank you for sending me this letter which I will open up off-camera you're a very nice young man for doing that [Applause] teller that's not me KP asking you to do all of you that is uh there's not even a name in here Kelley whoever this guy is he seems very nice and extremely thoughtful but maybe a little forgetful because I don't know what his name is but you should go out with him portable and intelligent electric skateboard from SPECT you know before I open this skateboard one thank you for sending me wherever sent it to me too before you send me Electric skateboards I just want you to know how loyal I am to boost his board it's not just because like I've been there and they're super nice to me if they make a fantastic product so this is the whole skateboard whoa whoa look a little it is read before first ride all right so I gather from when I read the manual have you stopped you don't have a controller it's how you for that manual you don't have a controller it's how you step on the skateboard that makes it go step on it this way you go forward you step on it anymore space [Music] [Applause] [Applause] a Ford model and electric better how to work here it's supposed to be lies but it's decided to fight my quote look at it in terms of my plug that's what I like about it so I want an electric skateboard that I can like bring on airplanes with me but I can't figure out how to get it to movie there's no controller going to your locker figure this out well I mean it says in here that if you step on it in a certain way it's supposed to go and accelerate decelerate if you lean forward you're having about as much success as high-end Marlon he says if you step on your front foot Hey how'd you do that before the day of course of course Marlins gonna figure this thing out what did you do I don't know a good Nigel you look good I love it if you lean and after the sense the stand up straight and lean I don't think if your edges like that I think you got this book got a diploma like I think you have to be Marlon to ride this thing let me go all right I'm not giving up I'm going to read the manual here was just trying to figure out how to get my skateboard to work and I can't figure it out it was having problems man as you talk about the residuals over my gun right now I got 99 problems in my electric skateboard is one never burn it out I've never got it okay from a concept perspective the idea that I could travel with an electric skateboard that according to your manual has an 11 mile range is incredibly enticing that's everything I want out of electric skateboard that I'm not getting out of my boosted board so I do think there's a place for this little guy in the market it's incredible it also feels well built and all that stuff with that though I am a man of moderate to average to medium intelligence and I read this twice I'm also a lifelong skateboarder and a fairly competent guy when it comes to all things electronic I don't know what this means and then the last thing that I'm going to bitch about is the app it seems like you have to be using the app to get the board to work okay maybe that's okay but I don't think that's okay secondly I'm speaking from authority here I own a software development company you require all kinds of login credentials to ride my skateboard if you're making hardware don't demand a user name and password to ride a skateboard that's preposterous out of the box I just want to be able to ride this thing I'm sure it's expensive it seems like a lot of fun but it sends an hour on this I couldn't figure it out so I'm going to end this review without actually riding this thing and my review so far is you got some work to do feel like such a jerk for not doing a positive review but I got to be on it PS this is not a paid endorsement are you the guy who sent me the inspector skateboard I have some questions for you all right well first of all when I open the box and I saw this thing I'd never heard of it before and I don't know the last time I was so excited about a new toy okay so yes you address all of the shortcomings with the boosted boards is very challenging to travel with that big skateboard so I was really excited about the spectra but I'm sitting here editing my video review of the spectra and it's not I spent an hour and a half playing with your board and never figured out how to use it I couldn't make sense of your manual so the thing is we're going to have tutorial video that could give you a really easy rundown on how to do it um but the app basically once you log in Facebook Twitter whatever you log in and then you have access to the remote I haven't been this excited about aprox in a really long time I'm going to try doing the acting and using the remote connection do we know as a typical board to have this little acceleration/deceleration thing and then make up your mind how's that okay yeah my mind's not made up the verdict is still out I'm just frustrated and I wanted to share that frustration with you because I'm really excited about this thing No Deal is enough honest review speed record definitely appreciated alright so hi I'm seems like an awesome guy and like I said I want this thing to be successful I also want to be good so this is not a complete comprehensive review this is an incomplete unconfrontational [Music] okay everyone is asleep I'm ready for the race tomorrow I have been

supposed to be at this dinner in nine minutes and it's like 20 minutes away I screwed up good so instead of giving you a city tour I'll give you a life lesson this is true this is very true get a pen write this down ready however much time you think something's going to take you in life and will always take twice that amount so if you think it takes five minutes to drive somewhere it will always take ten if you think it'll take an hour to go get a stupid overpriced charger for your stupid overpriced laptop it'll take two hours everything in life takes twice as long as you think it will

six eight well today's the day of one first today's a day we're doing something at three six eight for the very first time that's what I'm trying to say we still haven't figured out like a lot of the details when it comes to how we want to activate the community here at three six eight and that's largely because we still don't really have permission to open this place up yet but I'm we're doing a little thing tonight we just invited some friends by we're calling it Taco Tuesday even though today is a Wednesday and cook dinner tonight we brought in special guests Mike and Joshua brothers green so what are you gonna give me the rundown all right we've got a lot of things so we're doing Mexican feast it's not like the best tacos in the history of right now are you doing vegan or would you and me both [Music] we've got we're making a cashew sauce here we've got these so we're doing a short rib or in salsa fresh slaw right here guacamole salsa verde got a salsa Roja right here it's going on so here's the here's the most important question how's the 368 kitchen awesome cuz they're the first to break in [Music] Thank You Jo for sending me these gummies I just hate six packets of them I feel a little like I'm gonna go ahh part of three six eight probably the aspect of three six eight that I'm most excited about is what we're calling like the incubator side of the company an incubator like a technology incubator is when is when like a founder somebody with an idea becomes part of this this organization called an incubator and they're that individual is given resources and access to information and gets networking opportunities and given the tool to take his or her idea and learn and figure out and take it from an idea to a company a YouTube incubator would effectively be taking like a aspirational youtuber somebody who wants to be a youtuber and taking them from wanting to be a youtuber and helping them to become a youtuber and I think three six eight or companies like three six eight could be all over the world and they could be these these entities were in people who have dreams of becoming a youtuber can solicit resources and become part of something bigger than just themselves and ultimately realize their ambition now we're we're still a long way from being there but a great way to start is by doing little get-togethers where similar minded creators can chitchat with one another get to know new people discuss ideas and let things snowball from there so in the long game I hope 368 becomes that and that's our ambition but for right now I mean for literally today we're just having like a some tacos tonight so people can just try to get together we can chitchat super casual it's not even it's just like it's just a couple of my friends from the city but it is kind of the first time we've invited anyone by three six eight okay I got to go see Minnie Mouse [Music] no quick work interruption today it's fashion week in New York City this week and I was invited to this fashion event that somehow involves Minnie Mouse so I asked if I could bring Freddie they said yes Candace and I are doing that now it's a big surprise for the little girl she's you know sort of freaked out how you feeling if I go you don't look that big we've arrived at the Minnie Mouse fashion event it's called mini style we're waiting on the Queen herself Minnie Mouse to come out Francine is not a she's not super patient [Music] what this looks like bodega where's Minnie now a truly lovely affair in there but we have yet to see Minnie Mouse and Francine is on the verge of completely losing her what's up I'm so sorry I haven't made Taco Tuesday intro but next week when I'm back y'all probably went won't do it next week either it may be the week after that [Music] the taco nights just getting started in fact it's barely started but apparently we've got a birthday topping and there's alcohol which was something amazing [Music] [Music] [Music] it went extremely well yeah received I think that it kind of brought back the memories of the underground catering we did that's like wait we don't have to just like get people tacos instantly it's bringing back good class you work I appreciate you thank you [Music] baby's kicking don't push you don't realize your own strength oh my goodness that was disgusting Oh God I mean that's beautiful but it's also that's disgusting honey what did you think of the first-ever 3680 Taco Tuesday very good but there was a lot of tequila I just think there weren't there was not a lot of drinkers I'm not a drinker yeah you know you can have some beer people always crack open a can of beer okay thank you for maybe some sangria okay we had margaritas that did okay [Music] [Music]", "label": "G"}, {"data": "sorry squirt [Music] [Music] we're at the wrong Airport weekends in the city are always like family time I sneak when I can't to workout run time to the office pretending to have important stuff to do and mostly just shoot a video now since today is not a regular day not to be making sort of a regular vlog entry because Candis and I are supposed to be out of town tonight I offered my apartment our apartment to a friend of mine now we're not gonna be out of town so we're gonna be at the apartment with my friend who's staying there winner I thought I'd share a story about my friend he was the guy who did that ridiculous gainer off that cliff in the devil's punchbowl [Music] here's how I met Clint I was there with a friend of mine named Graham grandma I had been skiing out there something you were at a bar we'd been drinking and we hatched this harebrained scheme and schemed to like travel to Africa and climb Mount Kilimanjaro it was just one of those things that you talk about if you've been drinking a lot it seems like a great idea Clint so we're going to Tanzania to climb the tallest freestanding mountain in the world big Kilimanjaro so was my big brother van Graham Clint and me traveling to Africa to find the tallest freestanding mountain on planet earth 5:30 in the morning as our first night in Africa and it just poured torrential rain all night last night and I've done some things in my life well a lot of things we'll most things including yesterday we missed our flight from the airport I've done a lot of things with zero preparation that I probably shouldn't have been doing but this one this tops them all so our first day here we decided to start the climb immediately so we're headed to the mountain now pretty exciting stuff pretty cool there's a meat market across the street that has the most pungent odor I've ever smelled this is years and years you have no idea how it works now but typically when Westerners Gringo's travels to Tanzania to climb this mountain there's a lot of planning and preparation you hire mountain guides like we did none of that we just showed up and started asking people in Tanzania how do we climb Mount Kilimanjaro [Music] eventually we met these dudes they seemed nice we paid them in dead presidents stacks of $100 bills one of the more jarring aspects of this climb was we went with the dudes who are gonna like carry our food up the mountain like the porters and they showed us where they were buying the meat now what so terrifying about this is like we're gonna spend ten days on a mountain there's no refrigerators and this was the meat that they were buying to feed us picking up the meat then we're gonna eat on our hike to the top of the mountain here it is now [Music] the gods did were I think reputable but yeah it was their idea to bring the booze if ever you are fortunate you were lucky enough to ever have the experience or the opportunity to go I highly recommend it like of all the things I've done in my life and I'm very lucky to have done a lot this is one of the most magical where we know yeah so we're halfway there in three hours our first night is as if you're experiencing every climate on planet Earth inside of like a five day climb first night went really well we're packing up now it's 650 in the morning morning boys this this is what our first camp looked like that is not Kilimanjaro my thumb is blocking the Sun day two is Graham's birthday six we didn't have a birthday cake but we did have a candy bar now I am extremely proud of the fact that when I climbed aconcagua that is the second tallest mountain of the seven summit the tallest mountain in the southern hemisphere a mountain that was in 6,000 feet taller than Kilimanjaro I did it with no porters no guides I carried my own stuff but when you go up Kilimanjaro you are required to hire these dudes to carry your stuff porters are carrying up all their gear but just the sheer amount of their hearing but seriously these dudes were so cool on earth but we are way above the clouds now as we got higher in altitude as it got colder I got sicker and sicker I this is cancer third day freezing out here it could've been because I was someone healthy back then or I have no idea but I got so sick climbing this mountain tomorrow morning we go from there to there now I'm a pretty tough guy and then I eat shrug off all the altitude sickness and the cold and whatever the hell else was wrong with me but we had to wake up at 4 a.m. the day we're doing this summit push and when I woke up that morning I just some caution I don't look good in this next shot it's uh his last day I climb into the summit in the morning it's about 20 below freezing feeling strong but me I made it it was things incredible like we're on top of the world there was a glaze it was extraordinary pretty amazing and this whole story this experience like we we turn this in one of the episodes for HBO show there's an amazing experience like the last big adventure I went on my brother van it was this adventure was that trip that climb that Clin and I went from being like to do to met in a bar in Colorado to being like brothers forever we spent the rest of that time in Africa we were there for a couple more weeks just like bopping around hands Ania [Applause] Avada yes boy we're going to fly there was this time we met this due to drop us off in a tiny little Cessna airplane in the middle of nowhere and we had to get a ride back on a tractor which took six hours this is what it's like to get buzzed by an airplane [Music] there were some great adventures I've said this before I've said this on the vlog before but when I was a little kid my mom said to me spend your money on things not trips cuz things last forever and experiences don't and mom I could not disagree with you more when I looked at at the adventures I've taken in the past I realized that they shaped me as a human being it was adventures like that spending time with friends like Clint that made me who I am but I look back at this like I don't know what things I had in my life then they're gone now but that adventure that experience will be with me forever it's the things in life that are temporary the experiences are forever you had it backwards [Music]", "label": "G"}, {"data": "hello hi honey everything went okay this morning yeah yeah okay I'm gonna go ahead and release the video then all right the hi she's super pregnant look at the size of this belly everything's great so far so far so good the baby's due in October we don't have a name but Francine has a name watermelon Francine has named the baby watermelon she calls her baby water no she just calls her watermelon it was baby watermelon and then it just became watermelon where's is watermelon sleeping does watermelon want some play-doh then she tries to stick it in my bellybutton so that's it we're very very excited and if you notice like inconsistencies with my uploads it's because like I'm much more restrained with my Daily Show now than I was before and like this weekend Candice was out of town and I was alone with the baby and I was just kind of like I'm not gonna work today I just want to enjoy this because we only have you think about that we only have four months left with Francine and then we've got another we have somebody else in the house poor thing poor Frannie she's not gonna know what hit her did you guys did you know that Candace is pregnant you think they knew listen everyone thought I was pregnant when I wasn't so that's not nice and just remember boys and girls never assume a woman is pregnant until she tells you she's pregnant no matter how pregnant she looks right or until she's holding the baby or until she's holding the baby I learned that the hard way I've done it twice you did that woman in the elevator saute I didn't want to make a big thing out of this I didn't want to make a big video I just wanted to share with you that this one's got a baby in her we did it okay she's hungry we're gonna get something to eat we'll see you tomorrow with a totally normal edited cool video about skateboarding or something stupid like that she's bragging okay all right uh and also David and license really sorry to hear about the break-up might not be forever you got three [Music]", "label": "G"}, {"data": "so what is this with you in my own video or on video [Music] I'm great how are you take your mom getting some free problem yeah they can hear free promo right here you got CeeLo that zombie gee thank you [Music] so packages keep showing up in my office as a result my office he's getting smaller and smaller just packages everywhere so today I'm going to dedicate the whole show to opening all the packages now if it's watching the open boxes for 10 famous doesn't sound interesting I understand come back tomorrow I'll have more of the regularly scheduled marginally more interesting programming that you've come to know and ladies in life [Music] so I have I have a dream that didn't come out right I have a watch something that I really wish I had that I don't think exists in the world I want to be able to take my cell phone plug it into any computer and have an icon show up on that computer I double-click and the computer unlike a new computer interface opens up just running off of my cell phone on the computer I want that to work on my Samsung phones I want that to work on my on an iPhone does that make sense though so you don't need to travel with a computer you just travel with your cell phone you plug it into any computer and that computer then becomes your computer which you carry in your pocket I don't think this will ever exist because it would decimate the PC market that said this is a perfect segue to the first part of today's unboxing video which which is going to be about this apparatus that Samsung is also for what it's worth I currently carry a black Galaxy s8 I'm switching to a silver one because all I didn't know they made a silver one I think it's better-looking if you're a longtime viewer of this show you know that I always disclose when I'm being paid to do something I am NOT being paid to make this video but I do work with Samsung and they put me in that commercial and if I'm going to be totally honest with you I just tweeted a couple weeks ago that I was curious about this thing and next thing I know Kelsey you know Chelsea she's the girl everybody likes it sent me a keyboard a mouse the deck station in this ridiculous monitor so this is an absolutely bias review take everything I say with a grain of salt but uh okay let's just start it what this is supposed to be is a way to plug your well you plug well this apparatus here becomes the dock for your phone so you take this plug your phone in and then in the back here you can plug this into a monitor and a keyboard and then this is supposed to operate as a computer what we have here is your basic Logitech Bluetooth keyboard this is a bluetooth mouse calc yellow why you think I don't appreciate it this is a big enough monitor or what HDMI a lot of cable to power cable just like an evening just like a woman - alright thanks for your tech support you turn it on ah power hey I changed screen resolution so now this whole computer system here is based on my phone how to pair aha that's the browser I have running these are all my apps oh you're a new TV video you add Jesse and Jeana oh shoot [Applause] okay so just to be clear this is what my phone playing on a monitor this is YouTube playing on a monitor off my phone control the computer and keyboard of Jesse's new video all right Jesse I love you I'm going to come watch Phoenix watching that later this is very very impressive so far Samsung alright so moment of truth here this is really important when it comes to this say I have all this setup at home I unplug it that's good that's how it should work except for now I can't access my phone it just said yeah now here we go ready I come home from work plug it in one one thousand two one thousand three one thousand four one thousand see I just want to be able to plug it in have a boot up and go okay alright that's pretty it's hard to say where this is super practical because you do have to have this and then you have to have all the cables and then you have to have wireless Bluetooth and keyboards it's not as simple as that idea that I want where you just plug this into any computer when you're at a hotel you're at an airport or something like that you boot this up plug it in when all you have is this and it sort of acts as a computer alright I know that was a pretty abbreviated review but so far pretty impressed with this thing Samsung nicely done [Music] now there are a lot of packages here for mail time but I'm going to go ahead and begin with the bigger packages because they take up the most space and I need my space back Oh a dry erase channel thank you whoever sent that to me just a quick we are redoing all the branding around beams so the old beam logo that looks like this I don't wanna get too nostalgic but that's not a thing of the past hi Casey video of you inside since I snowboard video aspirin in it just in general I try to discourage this kind of thing this is the bag of dirt there's no porn in there that's I think there's

right I'll get along I'm going to go ahead and end this week mail time right there not because I don't have any more packages to open but but the studio is pretty much destroyed and well quite frankly

opened one here in New York City is often to the door I told you I'd be here they'll often believe you I know I'm not dressed I want to work out a little bit so that's plenty in here guys when you

is my lucky night hey I'm not that ugly now I'm down in Tribeca right next to the Metro but I'll be looks bad for business", "label": "#"}, {"data": "[Music] so I get emails companies reach out to me I get contacted all the time people wanted me to review or talk about their new products I almost always say no so this company called Rilo contacted me about their new 360 camera I was super skeptical it's a 360 camera and I already have this 360 camera this 360 cam this 360 camera and I even I even bought like this 3d printed GoPro 360 camera Wow well I do think 360 is important I just don't so that's why I wasn't super interested in this camera but then they sent me this video as to how it works [Music] so what that was is using a 360 image the same kind of 360 image that one of these would give you and basically it's like pick whatever camera angle you want pick it in post-production and they also made software that enables that [Music] but it grows your hug so again I'm just holding this I'm just holding this thing still and like that spinner on so you could see that guy I did that in your app app I recorded this now what's particularly compelling here is not so much the hardware the hardware's it's nice its sturdy it feels well built but it's the software here's how I was doing all of those shot again unfortunate they don't have Android software but here's what it looks like on my iPhone alright so that's the image that's the image as it was shot there but then in their software you can navigate what the camera is pointing at so there I am yapping at the camera just kind of tap to pause on that ready then hold on my face like this okay now look I'm locked on my face I can tell it to or follow this face so if I do follow this now no matter what my head is what stays level on the shot [Music] so that entire skateboard ride I just had this thing out it's charging had this out in front of me like this I wasn't spinning it I was doing I was just holding it in front of me oh you're here or we gonna go do something so fun Franny yeah yeah did you take a nap you did sleep my man how you doing cool baby everything good everything's great how you been I'm good I'm good happy holiday happy holiday Claire to see you in two come with us [Music] traffic so the question is is there real market for this camera and its technology or is this just another cool gimmick that people will get sick of quickly and and the answer and I don't know the answer see tomorrow is the Macy's Day Parade and they fly all these floats down the street and this is where they fill them up with helium the night before see the big helium tank right there [Music] so at $500 who is the Rilo camera actually for made a chart I see the whole camera market as bifurcated into two groups and this is an oversimplification but I think it does sort of illustrate the point anyone from an aspirational creator all the way to professionals are in one category the other category I just call casual as here's some concern for this product if you're in the first category that is the aspirational it's a professional category or around the same $500 you could get an entry-level SLR camera like this thing or you get a high quality point-and-shoot like this so if I'm an aspirational creator I don't know that I'd be spending the $500 on this because it's not quite as dynamic as a traditional camera and then on the other side of that spectrum you've got professional users and if you're a pro you're not going to use a consumer marketed product like this you're going to use maybe one of the fancier GoPro rigs or something like that so I don't think this fits in to this category so does it fit into the sort of casual as and my feeling on that is also a no because casual as creators they just use their phone so that's it that's for that's it for my my Rilo experiment seems like a very cool device had was good yeah and for what it's worth I really appreciate that this is a startup company meaning a student coming from like a huge corporation or anything in fact when they sent me this device they sent me this little video Chris from Rilo I'm definitely rooting for you and your company I hope this thing finds success do I see a place for this in my own repertoire of filmmaking tools I don't know all right that concludes another case united side tech review I think maybe cuz it's Christmas or something but people are sending me an insane amount of gear there's like five new electric skateboards over there I don't even know it's in these gigantic boxes over here

here over to 4k go ahead and do that right now okay the first scenario we're gonna be testing these phones cameras in is right here in my studio ready alright so this shot right now was shot on the Samsung Note 9 and this shot here was shot on the Apple iPhone X so we may tap on the screen to set focus or something like that but beyond that both of these cameras are shooting at 4k 30 frames per second and in full auto we're not using the manual features on either of these phones [Music] okay so for the first kind of outdoor test I'm gonna do some moving shots on the skateboard so you can see what the optical image stabilization looks like on these cameras and I don't know just see what the outside looks like sound good great now I'm good I'm good [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] whoo

things like that to catch up on the real business stuff to do this morning but one of my favorite people but haven't seen in a really long time is in town i'm going to see him this afternoon first meeting of the day is in midtown not a huge fan of midtown when I do so up here i'll let go through times square i'm awesome how you do it because i like to see the people and x 4 is kind of amazing with this place every boat control skateboard yeah then you just think you're the coolest guy ever now let's do not stand next to you I don't stop you're making me blush alright it's three in the afternoon i just finished a one-hour long phone call and then a three hour long meeting i'm going to go home she left all my stuff there and then go to the office midtown look up look up what are you doing that stop sign almost got hit by a car my guy who is literally smoking a blunt behind the wheel goes through a red light and a general break up off the floor i look up and he's smoking up one and goes like this like go ahead sweetheart you who's got nothing to get smoking plugs but if you're gonna do it don't run over people on skateboards dude it's like 5pm i still haven't gone to the office yet trying to get out of here I just like sit down my computer and start working and there's so much work to be done that like it at home there's nobody here bothering me I this is da this isn't mailtime this is just stopped my order i kind of want to apologize kid out that I want to apologize to him because i'm sure he thinks that was being rude and maybe I kind of was but like there's nothing I love more than meeting people like want to say hi to me because i like my youtube channel that honestly is like my favorite thing but I hate when people show up outside my office this is where I work i'm always so busy i'm running in and out of this place like I've my time here is very narrow and it's very stressful for me like we're running out of my office there's like 10 people like taking a picture i'll just outside like having a really intense business conversation with matt my business partner and we're like talking for like having a conversation like intensely and somebody came up and was like KC KC KC and I was just like excuse me I'm having a conversation and I could tell that he was really upset by me saying that so I'm sorry I didn't mean to upset you also didn't mean to like be rude or anything i'm generally not that root of a human being listed how appropriate alright I didn't order this somebody sent this to me there's a gift receipt there doesn't say who it's from just let's get forefoot check out the name of this book release your anger maybe instead of time I came outside to not interrupt me maybe I should just show up here and colored thank you whoever sent me also i know i said this was a male time but maybe this is mailtime disguises packages for things that I thought it ordered who I did order this ok what this is is this is like the tiniest drone you can but look this is a drone that fits in your pocket and it has a camera on it oh this is perfect so just lost my dream yesterday this is very exciting today's episode of kc nice thats blog is a review of this tiny itty-bitty drone ocean club three tongues out that's what I wouldn't eat these instructions are insane look at all that right typically i try to provide comprehensive reviews of new technology this is going to be whatever the opposite of compliments this is gonna be Who special visitor remember how is saying my life favorite person in the world in town well char this is my homie drone you know it's just saying last week that everybody says I'm short and I'm like not that short i just have really tall friends from 6 foot 9 no.62 it is very useful it that's not what I'm ordered this tiny foldable pocket road and i think i lost my drone this is the drone here now I charge the battery i downloaded the app this is what it looks like in your do your butt go it's just it just messin up the other old pal old broken hello get this this powerup works back alright it's been about 40 minutes later but i did get this thing to work I'm going to take off from you ready all right this is the tiny hand round taking off the hell did i just do ok false alarm once again have to do some key drones is not the hardware now this thing physically looks like what matters is the software like what powers it what controls it when you're counting on software to operate this like flying camera there's like so many variables and you need to be accounting software and like I invited my friend over I just make him sit there and watch me not fly my grill it literally says right now that your drone gently how could you put home but ok well here we are right in to reply black do what you want highland soon as she got the little guys airborne that there are no controls on the screen company will continue to eventual took down your template wouldn't do my job okay there it is i have a role some video on this thing ok you have a student group can you be so important that I see almost appear at least landed safely if you take it outside yeah certainly wait let me just read the manual first again ok I take back most of the bad stuff that I said about this drone that was pretty fun ok forward til 0x0 problems left till but he may go up and down the cootie because my office in front of a camera store there's a light in the window which makes us look professionally live resetting the drone it did not work the way it's going it going here girls what are you thinking a tiny flying thing and it doesn't have a camera well sort of this is what it looks like you kind of all that is a massive massive overstatement okay bring it back darn the Walkabout got 100 lb you need to show was in some Tim that cold and the wind I did lose a drone and that's an irresponsible thing to do it was a toy drone I probably should not have been flying it outside even setting fly outside but you know I was laughing and that was fun like kinda stupid having some late night on raw vegan food just farted I'm finding it helped the amount i remember telling you one day case you would be vegan did not know it I know it Francine whatever the music having a dance party cheese that's the cheese I thought she pooped her parents your pregnancy very good the conclusive outcome on this review is a determinate finger I'm really good at flying drones I've gotten so good at it i just think that I wasn't applying that row sure it will ever see it again yes we gotta get back this responsibility", "label": "#"}, {"data": "Wow I'll take a shirt okay great good time for you I guess I see what a smaller [Music] this behind me may look like a crime scene of some sort this is no crime scene at all just bluebloods the TV show is that a fake hot dog stand everything's fake how you doing hey doing good big fan dude I think you're awesome nice to me is there any film in your camera no it's a prop dude how's the investigation some fake Mercedes shooting some fake dude I guess it looks hard hi dude I can't walk past this line because I have like official gear oh no this is what you call a picture car that's not a real compliment but to have a picture car like this in New York City nians there has to be actual cops nearby just in case someone gets confused I think the real cops are over there I can't tell though they don't look real hot pretzels drop hot dog buns a million reasons to love New York City but like skateboarding into work and going buy a movie set like that just makes it I don't know just remind you how amazing this city is this is my new necklace this is my new amulet highly fashionable yesterday I was out of town on a shoot on a big shoot that was awesome somebody came up to me on this shoot and they said part of the reason why I moved to New York City was because I was watching your vlogs they're watching my vlogs and all of the time lapses and all of the footage of New York City is what convinced them to move here that exact conversation I have at least once a week if not more so it's been a little while since I've uploaded and rather than explain why I haven't uploaded I thought I would share with you kind of what I've been thinking I wrestle like on a daily basis I wrestle with like existential thoughts like what is the point why am i doing everything that I'm currently doing and TV little context of that it's like I've got a grown kid I got a little kid not to have another kid is YouTube channel this office my company got my running which is just crazy why do I run so much my loving wife why do I wake up every single day before 5:00 a.m. what am i chasing and the answer is I don't know and this isn't like some emotional cry for help I am extremely happy I'm happy right now I'm a happy person I'm I'm grateful for everything that I have I'm appreciative of what I am and and how I got here there's very little that I take for granted but I want more I want to do more I want and I want and I want in Y like where does that come from a B C they always BBC closing always be closing always be closing one of my one of my favorite creators one of my favorite people Ethan Klein he's like taking some time off right now and he posted that he's taking a little break because he felt like he was chasing something instead of appreciating what he had I really like that I think it's poetic and that's beautiful see yeah ambition ambition is both a curse and a blessing it's a blessing because without ambition you're just kind of treading water it's ambition that makes you swim to places you could never imagine it's ambition that takes you everywhere you would ever want to go but it's a curse ambition is a curse because it's not getting to that destination it's not achieving what you hope to achieve that satiates are satisfies your ambition it's the actual chasing it's the do ambition is only like the imaan sterlet ambition is only fed if you're constantly spoon feeding it the doing not the accomplishing so every time that someone who's really ambitious tries to stop you've stopped feeling satisfied the curse that is ambition always demands more and I don't think that everyone is cursed or blessed with ambition I don't think that like ambition is this universal North Star so that brings me back to KC the existentialist what's the point what is the universal North Star what's the one thing we're all chasing after and I think like in my heart I genuinely think that one thing that we are all pursuing in life is happiness happiness is the point happiness is the ultimate accomplishment it's what we all want or it's at least what we all should want happiness and and happiness doesn't just manifest as a product of ambition but it can come from love or it can come from calmness or it can come from whatever is a sense of fulfillment what in life gives you that and then thinking that through like what makes me happy I you know my family makes me happy my running makes me happy wait yep before 5:00 in the morning makes me happy and feeding my unrelenting ambition with work makes me happy so here I am back in the office doing one thing that makes me happy my North Star which is my work which is making video and that that kind of brings me to the next thing that I want to share with you so this morning for the first time in the history of ever we took all the white frosting off of the windows of the 368 retail store and now you can see it [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] now technically we're not supposed to open the doors yet we're missing something called a crowd control permit but considering there's no crowd outside I feel like it's okay

linked below anything else lady [Music]", "label": "G"}, {"data": "[Music] it's 457 the movie starts at 6:00 I've got an hour and three minutes to get there I'm a big fan of superhero movies but not a big fan of all superhero movies let me begin in 1989 with Tim Burton's Batman now I was a child when this movie came out but I remember seeing in the theaters and it blew my mind you can't make an omelet without breaking some eggs I've seen it like 20 times since and it still holds ever dance with the devil in the pan Tim Burton's Batman is definitely one of the best superhero movies ever was it better than 2008 Dark Knight that's a tough one Christopher Nolan levelled up the entire superhero genre with the Dark Knight that bank robbery scene was one of the best bank robbery seems probably since michael mann's he also like Jon Favreau's iron man that's iron man won [Music] the combination of Favreau and Robert Downey jr. was was pretty brilliant it was the first time we saw any humor in the superhero genre please no gang size but when it comes to humor in the superhero genre it's Deadpool that takes the cake the way that like he even broke down the fourth wall in this movie was genius fourth wall break inside a fourth-wall break that's like 16 walls the casting the characters the factory like it was self-aware and it kind of picked on the x-men and they joked about not having enough budget it's funny that I only ever see two of you it's almost like the studio couldn't afford another x-man the taxi driver yes Ghita the movie is absolutely genius I can't wait to see number 2 now recently I also watched Wonder Woman and I didn't see in the theaters I watched at home with my three-year-old daughter who also loved it it was just an awesome movie the tie-ins with World War 2 in the historical stuff Sam Raimi's spider-man was good the first one but the other ones I mean I could take him or leave him guardians of the galaxy was also awesome I mean I loved the nostalgic soundtrack and like all the 1980s references it was a great story as far as superhero movies go they really they delivered alright that's it for my superhero masks by the way all those superhero masks for that quick scene they cost hundred and eighty six dollars I'm gonna try and return them but the expectations for Black Panther tonight they're on a different level and they're on a different level because of one reason and that is Ryan Coogler Ryan Coogler is the director of Black Panther now Ryan's only made two other movies the first movie was a movie called Fruitvale station it was so good that it honestly made me not want to make feature films I know that I'm not capable of telling a story the way that he told that story that was his first movie his second movie was Creed the rocky movie the Philadelphia movie the Creed is kind of the only movie that I've seen that I can remember literally in the theaters Candis and I standing up and applauding at the screen so I have to I have to leave in four minutes to go meet Aquila but expectations extremely high for tonight's screening [Music] Candis is Lake Superior movies so I'm bringing my friend akela as my date look at this picture she just posted on Twitter she um she painted her fingernails to look like black panther she painted tiny black panthers on her fingernails and that that's how I know I I picked the right day Kim yeah a lot of people showing up for this preview screening yeah preview tonight preview are you excited for it all right [Music] Akilah seems pretty confident that we just cut the whole line I was outside waiting she wasn't God this all I need thank you expectations best movie since the Dark Knight that's what you think it's gonna fit in I think it's gonna be like that like like Atari Dark Knight was the last like seminal supergirls yes and I did like we're gonna be quoting and we're gonna be referencing it for a decade every day at what point in time I can he yelled at for bringing a huge camera and microphone into a preview screening of a movie I feel like the moment we reach the top of this escalator it's gonna happen hmm sir you put that camera away sorry sorry what did he sit this wait there's tape here what we do over I think the movie is about to begin we're not allowed to film during the movie no we're not [Music] yeah [Music] my son it is your time okay this is the comprehensive review coming at you from Aquila and Casey I mean it was it was what we predicted which is like I think a game changing not just superhero movie like every foe I mean the special effects the colors I think that's where you start the character development no they never take characters that find superhero I mean no like really we would have everybody's backstory times 20 Michael B Jordan as the as the villain best superhero villain since Heath Ledger at in yeah with the complete the Joker I mean it was like a deep you felt yeah I was like okay you like no oh and fight sequences were spot-on you Peter Longo was like pretty unbelievably fabricated character she plays a spy that's not giving anyway no I mean okay there's a reason why it has like ninety nine percent on Rotten Tomatoes it really is all it's cracked up to be we're trying to keep this review spoiler alert frame no okay on a scale of one is it four stars or five stars it's a four star like hotels 5 stars for like rating okay okay on a scale of one to five stars we give it a resounding you", "label": "G"}, {"data": "but if the exact same that she was bad she was 13 so I don't know if I've made

GoPro and I was like I don't want to film the gross stuff and the doctors like a cowboy in Texas took the camera and film the gross stuff I've never looked at it she's looking at it i'm going to hide in here is that it like like broke my arm broke my microphone was pretty my camera my backpack this is one of the most common problems and if you know a way to fix this let me know but where the microphone jack goes into the camera sticks out like this when i put in my background it always breaks by the sound is so often messed up in my videos luckily i keep a pretty solid inventory of equipment here in the office to suit by every so there's some new stuff here but the new equipment arrived when I wasn't here and got a chance to play with it yet i do want this per watt and pretty

them over this is pretty next level image stabilizer for cell phone and go pro I can't wait he is this are you watching a nasty stuff are you crying regarding microphones I typically use one of two microphones I like this I like this road microphone lot solid microphone lately I've also been using these sure microphones they're great slightly different sound profile but just as good of a camera more recently sennheiser came out with this microphone i haven't used it yet but sanitizer makes great products and I'm really looking forward to this also i put on these dead cats on this and it really kills any and all wind it's this fuzzy thing that gives me sucked clean sound like when I'm riding my skateboard in the wind talking to Cameron it still sounds good because this very thing

cagey about where I'm going or what I'm doing but I had to promise not to reveal the details of this trip and told monday night at 8pm so i cant even sure where I'm going I can't share why I'm doing there I really need to review all the details soon really soon I just like you know a day for you to bear with me yeah in the drawer to the left of the self you got it right yeah no big deal in other mildly exciting news i'm flying virgin atlantic sorry never flown virgin atlantic before the line here virgin is like a mile long so let's sew up this boosted board that while i wait i bought this bag aftermarket like it wasn't made by boost its made by some I don't know was expensive though it's completely falling apart of this the strap ripped off and buckles broke and I had to put these carabiners on as the plastic ones broke broke over here trying to stitch this back together here really have nothing but disdain for low quality products and you know the high-quality booster for back let me know and i don't want a gun bag or like a pool cue bag that's we made just for boosted boards otherwise it's a nuisance currently enroute to the Virgin lounge which I've never been to that

episode i complained about microphones and go to my studio and I get a new microphone and then spontaneously the shot when I go into the closet the sound gets totally fine and nowhere and that's why I like okay I like that but you really left that's called peaking lights at the top I don't know why it does that I changed no settings it like does that on its own this is why we smash my camera so frustrated when stuff like this sorry I'm sorry about the the low sound quality for the second half of today's episode thanks for hanging in there", "label": "#"}, {"data": "[Music] good morning for a run great morning but uh you see it looks beautiful over there but then stormy open up rain 8 running in the rain it does look like yeah it doesn't like the storms getting closer see this great band ear behind that is rain I mean I'm no meteorologist but that's just my prediction [Music] [Music] okay much much to discuss today on the show I want to start things off with a really awesome update something that I've been looking forward to sharing with you for a while now which is that a few weeks ago when I crossed the 10 million threshold I launched this t-shirt and it was part of like an initiative to raise money for this young lady who lives in Flint Michigan her name is Mari she was trying to raise money to give the school supplies and backpacks to kids who otherwise couldn't afford it I announced that for every shirt sold we give four dollars to her fundraiser and we did it we sold twenty-five hundred thousand thousand dollars to her fundraiser which I'm going to give right now ha we did it guys good work everyone we did it we push Mari over her goal of $75,000 Mari I hope to meet you someday and I should say that I've never met Mari Mari I hope to meet you someday her people and and she personally reach out to me on Twitter and we've been dealing a little bit so amazing getting to know you alright what else in the update there's nothing on here it's just a blank pieces ah Twitter we got the handle on Twitter don't ask how we got that but we got the hand I'll follow 368 on Twitter we'll try to be interesting we have the same handle on Instagram I think we got the same handle on Instagram so now both the Instagram and Twitter handle 4 3 6 8 is simply at 3 6 8 that is called nepotism okay ah other update beam that you haven't heard me talk about beam in a long time the team from being that I used to make videos with they're still making videos they still operate independently they're still doing their own thing and the stuff that they're making is fantastic so I'll link their channel below they're on YouTube send them some love you won't regret it [Music] my friend Griffin Harrington shot that this morning on the subway Griffin nice catch but that is that is really how wet it is in New York City today a couple days ago on Twitter I saw this video that was kind of going viral and it was this kind of like big mafioso looking dude sitting on like a public transportation train and he was just shaving matter-of-factly he had shaving cream on he was shaving and the people film me or sort of snickering and making a joke of it and it was it was and I remember my finger went straight the retweet button and I hovered over it I thought it'd be funny to share it's a very New York City moment but I didn't click the button and I thought for a second look maybe there's more to this story i whatever and then I scrolled on and I went on with my life so then this morning I see this news story that's trending and the title of the of the news story is man can't save II on train and viral video says don't judge so let me just I'm just gonna read a little bit a man was mocked online after he was recorded shaving at his seat on a commuter train heading out of New York City said he was just trying to clean up after days spent in a homeless shelter the story goes on it says the truth Torres says is that the video captured him at a vulnerable moment he had been homeless staying at a shelter in New York City he reached out to his family for help a brother gave him money for a train ticket and then this is the part that really hit me hard he goes he left a shelter before having a chance to shower and clean up and he wanted to look presentable so the nut of the story is just that this guy has a really hard life he's trying to get some help he didn't want to look like a schlub so he shaved and he was ridiculed for it and the story ends by saying a quote from his brother maybe people will have more feeling knowing what this kid's been through so the moral of the story for me is never judge generally like everybody has their own demons that they're dealing with their own struggles that they're dealing with so before before I judge I I want to make a more concerted effort to really try to empathize with others and that's what that that's that story just kind of made me think of how's it going how many captains today five five yeah I'm Casey yeah Justin is this the most popular one so far it is Justin let me see okay and of all of Jeremy's great designs what about that one you like the most I think it's more

after Dan got hurt standing in the rain at me Oh Dan I gotta talk to you about Dan dad was only here temporarily you know from the start but we weren't sure when like that temporariness we weren't sure how long the whole thing was gonna last and okay so I guess he was in Northern Ireland for like a video conference or something and instead of coming back to New York he had to go back to South Africa and he told me from South Africa he's like hey bro I heard you like the South Africa none of it made any sense there's something you had to deal with there apparently so I danced back in Cape Town not permanently but for now and it's really sad because he's like three 6/8 cheerleader and mascot and he's just drawn don't forget us stand [Music] [Music]", "label": "G"}, {"data": "I want to give a tiny a bit of context to this interview I want to explain why did this interview and and how this interview came to be Logan Paul has had an outsized impact on the YouTube community his actions affect the entire community and while this is true of all big creators Logan Paul in in general and the size of his audience have amplified the consequences of his bad decisions there was a sense of shame and embarrassment around a lot of the YouTube community after the suicide forest video and and all the the fallout from the negative press because of the suicide forest video and in the aftermath of that Logan did some interviews and Logan released some videos explaining himself but I know that I was left with a lot of questions questions about his intent and why he did what he did and you know he still has this enormous audience on YouTube what are his plans what are his intentions moving forward so a couple of weeks ago when he contacted me about a documentary he's currently making about his life on YouTube I obviously had a lot of questions but I told him that I would be willing to do the interview for his documentary provided he'd be willing to come here and sit with me so I could interview him on my channel and to his credit to Logan's credit he agreed and he agreed that nothing would be off-limits and he also encouraged me to challenge him he he he wanted it to be an honest and hard interview so those are the circumstances surrounding it that's how it came to be and it's now been a full week since I did the interview and to be totally honest I wasn't sure I'm still not sure if releasing it is the right thing I I Harbor a lot of self-doubt about maybe I was too easy on him I mean maybe I was too argumentative with him the things I hope to learn my very specific intention with this interview was to see if he was sincere about what he's trying to accomplish with this documentary or if the whole thing is just a charade for good PR and now I feel like watching this interview over and over and over I still I don't know I there's a little bit of me that thinks maybe I'm enabling Logan he and I have known each other for years we've always been friendly and by putting this on my channel am I now part of the machine to rehabilitate his image it's not what I want to do that is not my intention but could this be viewed as that I I don't know so I hope that this interview will help the community better understand why he did the really stupid things that he did and if he's now truthful and sincere about wanting to have a positive impact on the platform the platform that he and his really stupid really terrible decisions and actions did so much damage to so I'm I'm really seeing and this video is not monetized this video is also not edited this is the entire 30 minute conversation that I had with Logan Paul one week ago so let me start I just want to ask what is this documentary yeah so I mentioned in one of my vlogs and there's been a lot of speculation on what people think it is the doc is not a it's not a documentary about how dang hard my life has been this year it's about the story of a young man from Ohio a seemingly regular kid being me of course falling into the social medium machine over the past four years building an audience garnering false power through views which equates to money which equates to against success and then essentially losing it all overnight becoming the most hated man in the world in the snap of a finger so the question that the doc answer is how do you recover from that can you recover from that me sitting you with you right now I'm in the journey right now with you like will is it possible for Logan Paul to make a comeback or am I going to be a failed youtuber and fall and crawl into a hole like half the world wants me to do is you know just ask directly is this a fluff piece to make people feel better about Logan Paul no no not at all this it's it's from making content throughout the years I try to be as unbiased as possible and when you say fluff piece like what because like a video it's just like look ride that you should feel bad here's a way to characterize it is the video about how you've learned to better empathize with others or is the video about making it easier for people to sympathize with you um I don't I don't think people should can or will sympathize with me let's be honest Casey like what I did it there's no distracting people there's no well here's what I tried to do and this is why it's okay there's none of that it's an unbiased objective story that captures how something like that can happen and what what went wrong in my life that I thought that was a good idea because at the end of the day I'm the one who has to look in the mirror and say that was my decision and that's that's a hard thing to do is even like hard talking about it right now with you because up until that point in my life I I it was really only winds it was only success it was only consistent growth and and everything was going so well and I got so caught up with my actions being validated by millions of people I forgot to be a human being in that situation and instead decided to be a content creator and that's where I messed up do you it's are even in there there's a little even in that response there was like maybe I'm being cynical but there's a little whiff of it sounding like you see yourself in some capacity as a victim no I know by no means am I the victim here and I guess it's it's sort of tough because I want to make it very clear I am I am not the victim here by no means and everything I say I do need to not word it like that because I'm I'm not the victim what I'm not afraid to do though is be vulnerable about this and open up and say by no means by no means I know what I did was disgusting it was it was wrong it was an extreme obviously lapse in judgment like I've said but by no means am I am I the victim or claiming to be the victim do you would you characterize this is a redemption story it's an attempted redemption story is what it is that's it are we still talking about the doc yeah I mean that's what it is that's what like again will I come back I say yes that's what this what the doc is about the story is is it not how long has it been since the yeah is it not is it not premature like it before you can tell a redemption story there has to be an act of redemption true so what is that what is that what is the act of redemption bin for Logan Paul it's it's not been done yet that's what the doc is about and like again this whole the whole idea of the harlot is crazy fine the whole the whole idea of the doc is like we don't have plans for it we don't plan on like profiting off it if if we if we are gonna monetize it if I don't know I don't know cuz what we want to do I've told stories my whole life through a lens as have you so the thought process is why why'd let someone else make that story cuz someone's gonna want to make that story people have wanted to make that sort why let someone else do it when I could just do it myself and I know that if we do decide to monetize it 100% of the proceeds will go to some sort of suicide prevention awareness program because that's that's essentially what this whole thing is about are you are you a different person now than you were yeah absolutely oh let me follow it up by because I've heard you say that how have you demonstrated that how have you not just said but what have you done to demonstrate that and are you even sharper in saying that like a lot of your content I think the suicide video that you came out with your first video back no really demonstrated what your channel is capable of and talking about something bigger than just Logan Paul but there hasn't been much since then there hasn't been much that's demonstrated you're a different person you talk about positivity and being a different person and changing the structure of the channel and then it was days later you're shooting a dead mouse so what what had you done to demonstrate you changed as a person the rat the rat was right yeah the rat was that was me becoming obsessed with the idea of being a villain when when the whole world hates you I just I made the conscious decision I'm gonna I'm gonna be the guy they think I am and I essentially became the architect of my own destruction because I wanted to be who they thought I thought I might as well adopt this adopt this screw it and it wasn't that a direct contradiction to everything you just put out about how you're changing and how you're a different person yeah videos we're inside of a week yeah I know but it to me while I can still be a good person I'm also still was possibly am the guy who takes things to extremes that's I mean that's that's who I am that's the brand of Logan Paul it's the fastest the biggest the best the greatest and but and it's not that led you to the I mean that's how you started this exactly I mean that's that's everything is to the extreme right so if I can make content and I have been for four years for four years making people laugh smile believing themselves making them believe that they can accomplish their goals even if they're from a small town in Ohio because I made these mistakes yes I'm going to demonstrate more empathy and more compassion but at the same time I still have my brand and what saw thing to me is that brand of living life on the edge do you understand I I do but I think it's sort of a convenient umbrella to hold over everything so I think it it's Noble when you talk about motivating people I think it's it's I think it's a noble ambition to want to inspire and motivate people especially someone like how you characterize yourself and coming from being a normal guy yeah but I think that like to use that same to use that same pretext as sort of justification for you know killing a rat or well I didn't kill the rat those circumstances around that video or some of the other more controversial sensational things you've done running around Japan wearing silly outfits yeah so that Union sensitive to culture that's all part of the same I want to address this cuz I'm not gonna lie this is the the hardest thing about all this is I think being perceived as culturally insensitive as far as the outfits go they were on sale at a store right next to the temple that we were at for tourists do we not buy the outfits don't know if they're on sale there and then deeper I mean that's we could dive into the specifics of what happened there's a difference between culturally insensitive and insensitive the brand that I was at the time was just all-around insensitive and that's the person who I am no longer trying to become and will no longer represent on the vlogs yeah and you think that that has been the case with your content since that moment till now there's this looking ahead this okay so it's it's this is looking ahead yes but because you're right it's like I said those things and then you go and taser that rat what the what happen did you just contradict everything and the answer is again like you said yes that's why it's hard for me because how many times can you say one thing and then try to be a better person but truly now it's like I'm vegan now I got a girlfriend who is extremely wise and she helps me grow and become the person I want to become my content is focused more on positivity and doing what you want to do to achieve your goals which is all like I said it's always been that but all that stuff is overlooked when you make mistake or why sensationalism clouds that it's like a an eclipse if if that mission which again I do think is noble but wanting to motivate I don't I don't even want to say it but when a moon comes in front of it and that moon is a moon of sensationalism that is harmful it clouds out a completely black Wow what's what's harmful I mean I think like the general sort of disrespectfulness that comes along with that kind of some true I think that certainly everything that sort of precipitated the suicide forest incident or I think that the you know like the the tasing of the rat and myriad other just kind of the general attitude that you characterize is living on the edge I think really clouds a lot of that much more a much more meaningful in addition of wanting to inspire true but I think this is a good dovetail for a bigger question that's that's that you and I both identify with which isn't like the pressure of being a youtuber of being a daily vlogger of uploading every single day of having to maintain that audience get more views so you can get paid to keep it going the focus on relevancy that focus on the biggest Channel today the most subscribers say like there are pressures that come along with that where you get this tunnel it's tunnel vision yet and that's why you know in 2016 I stopped logging I remember you you text me the day I stopped vlog because I felt like I went to a place where I was so caught up in that that I was full of well I was gonna ask you one question I have use have you ever found yourself in a place where you are being influenced by your success rather than your creativity and did that lead to your demise because that's what happened to me I would probably push back at the idea that had a demise but certainly it contributed to my not one I did two daily vlog I stopped an Aston stuff like why am I doing this and I was caught up in that tidal wave and that sounds like I don't wanna do it anymore and it's now my work is much more about creative motivation it's much less about like I don't care about use fighting for Elephants he doesn't make sense I don't care about that but I do want to back up so I ask this question because I want to understand where your head was before you went into that forest I don't want to beat that dead horse you've said a lot about that you've been open about that but I do want to understand like where was your brain leading where was the thought process leading up into that I talking about the day of like you were riding away that I I think no one in the history of YouTube had ever been on that they haven't that's why when I wanted to take you there when I sit here and say that every day we were creating a new piece of content meant to bend the limit push it right up to the edge be entertaining be funny be positive spread a message we got so caught up in creating that we did not stop to think about what we were making and whether or not it was right because it you make it you put it out we were on autopilot essentially which is it's it's extremely dangerous when you're broadcasting to an audience of five to seven million people every day and so there was no thinking there was it was create content create content create content not okay hey take a step back slow down breathe so the time I would be a human being that meet this mission of wanting to inspire and motivate like do you believe that or is that because if that's if that mission is the same as this this momentum this autopilot where's the distinction between wanting to do good and wanting to you know looking for sensationalism that will drive clicks I'm not I'm not sure I understand the question I also do want to say I'm not well-liked while the underlying mission is always that you can you should you achieve it's okay to be different it's I'm not that's not what my channel is entirely about it's a combination of that and it is entertainment it's a light-hearted comedy essentially that's what it is I just think those two things in conflict with one another essentially yeah and that's why I'm a brand that's that's who Logan Paul is because I do bridge the gap between being like a motivational speaker kids and standing on a stage in front of 300 people but also like hey I am a kid I'm 23 years old 22 years old at the time and if I want to go jump out of a plane naked I'm gonna do it but at the same time you can work hard and achieve your anybody ever want to do anything anybody ever faulted Logan Paul for jumping out of a plane naked no that's all I'm saying but I could give you a list of like I jumped off a bridge into the river in Italy is that culturally insensitive is saying Mamma Mia in Italy culturally insensitive I don't I would argue that it's just insensible but jumping on the hood of a car in Japan is and culturally it is yeah jumping on the hood of a car in Japan is culturally insensitive dressed as a pokemons throwing a Pikachu at the car I I absolutely think why do you think that's insensitive well I mean culturally culturally insensitive I think that's insensitive but the fact that it's being pinpointed to be culturally insensitive when I do that did did that everywhere that's hard for me that's hard for me to hear and listen to I mean without getting into too much nuance you're the culture of Pokemon is very much woven into the culture of Japanese culture yeah you were dressed up as a character from a Japanese pop cult you were dressed as a Japanese pop culture sort of icon as Pikachu so like I do think that there is a connection there well but Kasey they sell the outfits in Japan I understand I understand that do you Casey cuz I saw I don't know I don't agree with you but I I don't agree with me I want to make that clear I don't I don't agree with me or think what I did was right I'm just saying there's a difference between being culturally insensitive insensitive towards a culture and overall insensitivity which is what the old Logan Paul had an issue with and had a problem with and is now today what I'm working to not do ever again I just think you were both of those things okay okay but let me ask you took a month off yeah and talking about that autopilot that mentum and I get that dude I was been have been there how did that month off help you empathize and understand both the criticism coming at you which was like insane never seen anything like it yeah and then how did that like what did you learn in that month off so during the month off it was a lot of meeting talking to visiting Ashley came to New York for a couple days suicide prevention organizations organizations about mental health and finding out what it what it truly is like to have suffered from depression or know someone with depression or even know someone that has died by suicide because that ain't it's just it's just bad cuz this that's crazy Rose New York sorry the sirens here at the office are just unbearable um this is what I had that mother up there okay are you so you can see when they're passing dude I mean I have hours of footage of me just cursing the world um but continue you tell you you did you invested time in meeting with people yeah and to this day to this day the guy who is uh in my suicide be here tomorrow video at Kevin Hines I text him every single day and we we want to do something together in the in the future obviously I'm focused on this fight right now that's my number one mission but the month off was a step for me to once again become a human being and forget about views money success and clout and it was a chance for Logan Paul to be like okay this this this is why this is wrong because I had never been like I said in the video affected my suicide I don't know I didn't I didn't know what it what it means to know some are loose someone who has died by suicide so it was an attempt for me to discover that and once again like I said a million times right now become an actual human being and after after that video dropped I guess it's like did did did he give you an appreciation for the cuz that video I think had a very important message behind it was a I like that video I tweeted that I liked that video and I'm gonna get for it but did it show you sort of the demonstrate to you that your channel is capable of so much more and your reach is capable and your voice is capable of so much more than just sensationalism views yes but I mean but I I don't want to say I didn't know that I just was doing the wrong thing with with that capability I was I wasn't putting out PSAs like that it's it's the most viewed suus anti-suicide PSA ever and it was groundbreaking for me to realize it's it is possible for me to create a piece of content that can change that many lives I will say what we did in that video was the attempt with the forest video beginning middle and end I made it very clear that it is okay to feel ostracized and alone what's not okay is holding those feelings in and that I truly believe quote-unquote that every person has a place on this on this earth but we did that in such the wrong way we tried to shock it into people versus showing and demonstrating it's my telling and hard to believe that that's what the suicide forest video was about when you guys are laughing and smiling and just the thing that bothered me the most about the video was your excitement exercise you were excited to have found a dead body not not really this is oh this is this is what I watched it that was the emotion that I was that I that I took you from you and your Posse you guys felt like we've got something here that's going to get us views at the beginning of the video is like something you've never seen on YouTube before that is what affected me the most about that video because I understand that mission and I do think your your suicide video really accomplished that but if you're gonna conflate the two then I just have to I have to tell you why I don't I don't I don't agree with that complaint okay okay let's let's I want to hear about I want to talk about the fight what what is the fight you're fighting ksi sorry dude it's just it is brothers fight you don't want to move on you dream or you want to know just because yeah the laughing is it's a defense mechanism for me that's what it is absurd you say that do you believe it um I believe it when you're saying it but I don't believe that you expect people the eight million people that saw it video for say you know to understand within those contexts that you were just laughing at as a defense mechanism like I think that there's there's intent and and then there's there's actuality and there's a saying it's like the the road to hell is paved in intent because if all that really matters is what transpired and what transpired is you and your your peers your friends laughing and snickering and and making light of a human being who had died and I think that your intent in that moment is irrelevant all I see is what's actually transpiring I tried to move on from this and talking about the Box English man I just like I know I just understand it's it's hard for me to listen to someone to my face tell me that I was laughing at the guy I'm telling you how I hired a nurse in my perspective I understand I just I've met unique no you're not you're not unique you you do represent the voice of the people which is what I'm learning to I guess be vulnerable about I just like it was never my intent to come off like I was laughing or joking about Seuss I said suicide it's not a joke three times in the video because it's it's clearly not it I never thought it was I just used comedy when I'm uncomfortable or I don't know what to do when there's a lens on me and my actions are essentially being validated by five to seven million people and no one around around me is telling me hey that's not okay I understand that I understand I just excuses never validate yeah truth truth and your answers may be valid but it doesn't excuse the action does not at all and I'm like I said ashamed deplorable mistake and the only thing that I want to do right now is show that that video was not a representation of Who I am who I will become and who I want to be I appreciate that we talked about the plate now yeah sure we can talk about these well because he's turned off after 30 minutes keeping an eye on them what is what is your fighting que si what is the true what is the fight i'ma beat his ass I'm a big boxer I've been boxing for like 12 years I don't like to step into the ring because I don't want to get hit I value my brain too much but just if all I had to rely on was his face love and I wouldn't go very far I need the brain okay okay what is this um why is this happen that's essentially ksi he called me out he called my brother out and I accepted the fight I'm always up for a challenge I thought honestly for me having that event happen in January this was a way to step back from the world of YouTube and stop worrying about the views the money the clout all that went down I haven't grown on Instagram in six months literally at all and focus my efforts on something else so I can become a different guy this is like the boxing win for me is showing people that even if you fail even if you get knocked to the ground even if if you feel like you're at the lowest point of your life you can get up and do something and still win do you think that the fight is part of the redemption story do you see the finest part yeah yeah absolutely absolutely because it's it's not about a fight it's not about the boxing match itself like I said it's about being able to get hit in the face whether they're a result of your own actions or not in my case they are I'm the one who up but I'm willing to say ok this is the mistake I made I'm gonna keep my chin up I'm gonna keep moving forward no matter how many people want me to crawl in a hole and die forever I'm not gonna do that you can fail and still come back and still keep on going and still win so you're Jake's Deji ksi they've been cranking out content every day yeah it's like trash-talking I've seen them at the press conference is just being vicious they've just been non-stop and with exceptions it feels like you've been a little bit more reserved yeah including like the press conference in in London where after ksi just really got gnarly with his you know with his with his verbal exchange like he went to a really crazy place you just got up and walked out is this is this you being like frustrated or is this part of the new Logan Paul it's the new Logan Paul it's I have no interest in bantering back and forth with someone who is the exact person that I'm trying not to become and stay away from by degrading woman by going after my family in a in in a manner that is intended to harm he's I don't I don't have any interest in that the goal for me here is to beat him on August 25th not talk about how I'm gonna beat him not talk about his family or talk about what I'm gonna do to his girlfriend the goal is to win a fight and I just I was over it like I as soon as I walked in the press conference I was like okay this I'm just over the top Casey to be honest it's all it's all Fugazi Fugazi this time to fight this fight words right there um all right and then I I guess like a big question I have for you is like I don't know how to say it up there's a lot of like a lot of YouTube community was upset after a lot of you know the negativity around Logan Paul because they thought you sort of besmirched what it meant to be a youtuber Yeah right rightfully so I guess it's like what do you say to that how do you respond to that huh is there a response for that um I mean to my fellow creators like wholeheartedly I mean I apologized already but I am sorry that I I guess brought shame upon the platform is if that's how I want to word it that's why I say I guess is why I have to be so careful we're like how I talk but that's that's obviously not the person who I want to become or live in the body Oh for the rest of my life and just like I made a mistake I promise I will do the community well and keep my head up and keep on trucking in ring light to YouTube but obviously Casey it's it's horrible to see your peers sure and rightfully so because of my own actions like I just felt bad again I apologize for it I'll apologize for it a thousand times I don't want to sit here and be a sob story for the rest of my life so so then and and this will I want to end it with this but I want to ask what's next for Logan Paul but I want to ask within the context of like understanding your resume now has some some some dirty marks on it understand that you you carry this bag it's and there's no getting rid of it where do you go from here in the world of me what's your where does where do you want to be in ten years and how are you accomplish that having to lug around these you know these chains forever I think Hollywood I think America in general is it's they love Redemption stories they it's it's a story for me my life is now a story about someone who was winning someone who self imploded and was like I said the architect of their own destruction and struggle and vulnerability and now it's being able to say this is a part of my life and I want to become better I don't want to let my mistakes to find me I think a person is defined by how they recover from their mistakes and what's next for me is honestly probably just content creation businesses I can answer this question with a hundred things but all that matters to me right now is to fight August 25th get your tickets Lincoln bye all right thank you thank you for doing this entire interview without plugging your merge once have a shove BM I do I do appreciate your frankness and I appreciate Logan didn't see any of my questions beforehand I didn't bring any of this up so

Walter Raleigh South survey that was 2008 in Zanzibar vans of ours a little island off the coast of Tanzania Tanzania okay we're jumping on a little plane to go to sandbar now reach there this special edition blog is the story of when Graham and Casey and Clint and van went to Africa and climbed Mount Kilimanjaro so we're going to Tanzania to climb the tallest freestanding mountain in the world big Kilimanjaro how about need a blog about this no right now what you've mentioned it in different vlogs so I never made this vlog you've never made an exclusive Chile law but the doctors I'm getting here that's what I look like without a shirt on ten years ago yellow fever hepatitis typhoid and polio vaccination so that doctor you had to get shot to go to Tanzania for like malaria and malaria yellow fever yeah pitarrio DMV lady polio tetanus typhoid so that was the dream team it was banned KC Clint Graham this is definitely Graham sleeping on the airplane we didn't let we have us we didn't have a plan for anything our first day here we decided to start the climb immediately that we sure if we went there with enough cash that we would find somebody to take us up the mountain which was the case later this month naturally we load the cheapest least expensive guide we could find positive to get up challenger [Music] they were great nice guys I think we realized on our way there that what the value package got you yeah very cheap meat cooker get the meat then we're going to eat on our hikes the top of the mountain here it is now that's our cut so this guy turtle is one of the guys that was the best on the team and he was the official whiskey impresario you guys like whiskey that's except it was weird cuz we stopped at the grocery store to get food for the climb and all that the African guides were suggestions that we buy lots of alcohol for them [Applause] guys idea to bring whiskey up to the summit have to drink we're about to start our mission up to the top of Kilimanjaro one day it was amazing of this climate you literally started in a rainforest and on the last day we were like standing on snow and ice that is Mount Kilimanjaro my thumb is blocking the Sun we have all these dudes carrying all of our stuff it wasn't our choice shooting the porters Porter's are carrying up all the gear but just the sheer amount of they're carrying the law in Tanzania mandates that for every climber you have at least one person carrying your gear and it's a way to like bolster local economies but also they do it for safety we could carry around we tried to they wouldn't let us is that setting up camp on our first night not actually us setting it up other people setting up before us when we're booking the guides we were told we would have high quality chef traveling with us this is their tent where they cooked the food what was his name turtle turtle is the chef turtle was the chef food Oh crew Graham celebrated his 25th birthday on Mount Kilimanjaro happy birthday great birthday and dinner I don't know why I thought it was a good idea to climb out so many darling sneakers supposed to wear hiking boots when you're climbing the highest freestanding mount in the world but you chose sneakers my hiking sneakers are frozen solid this is going to be a problem two days then you can really start to notice me fading I look like a really ugly woman and this is our campsite on the second day we thought it'd be a good idea that instead of spending six days climbing we'd spend three days climbing twice as fast then we used the rest of our time in Africa to travel it was a great idea until the morning of the summit climb the craziest part of being up here is that were above the clouds I just want to point one thing out also the Red Hat that Casey's wearing so Megan the summit push tomorrow so not only did he not bring hiking boot but he also didn't bring a hat that was a hat that I've had three school camps this is campus third day freezing out here you're about to witness the moment when this entire trip for me went for me a fun totally a fun adventure to just an absolute his last day and climbing to the summit in the morning it's about 20 below freezing feeling strong hey you feeling grabbed strong next shot will be from the peak so in the end we made it we we summited [Music] [Applause] [Music] after some and so we did fly straight from the mountain to Zanzibar this tropical island off the coast of Tanzania and that was like today's our last day in Zanzibar and then we are coming home to New York and data that is the story of when Graham and I with van and Clint climb Mount Kilimanjaro [Applause] [Music] just as an aside there's an unpaid endorsement but this is grams and company grams and entrepreneur it's why we're such good friends we share a lot of similarities what is this gram man can is awesome why 100 percent California wine hey Grande this isn't one of your poems over so I just wanted to show the audience that you're also a badass entrepreneur okay that's it see you tomorrow", "label": "G"}, {"data": "just a quick preface here this interview took place twelve days ago now so any reference in this interview to Logan Paul or Logan Paul controversy is in reference to the events that transpired around the first of the year the Japanese forests not at all referencing the more recent Logan Paul controversy and and subsequent D monetization of his channel none of that is reference because that all happened after this interview took place while I would love to know more specifically what's around YouTube with these recent events unfortunately this interview took place before they happened hope that's clear okay here's the interview alright welcome ah have you ever made a YouTube video before no it's my first one I'm always very vocal with what I see as YouTube YouTube strengths and YouTube shortcomings and as Chris around Christmas and New Year's when all the logan paul stuff was going down and there was a lot of criticism of youtube's PR and everything else i e-mailed robert here and said why not use the platform as a way to communicate youtube's positions on these things in its outlook for the future and he said that's a great idea and this is sort of a first stab at that he offered thank you to come on my youtube channel and talk about the future of youtube and answer whatever questions I had is that fair that is absolutely fair and I'm so happy to be here so thanks for it's actually your idea it wasn't my idea it was yours and and it's risky but today that's that's what do you guys do risky stuff every day tell us who you are I think most youtubers and they think of YouTube leadership's they know Susan but people don't know you so who are you and what do you do sure so I'm Robert Kinsel I'm chief business officer of YouTube and in my day to day job I'm responsible for all the YouTube creators and and and content partners who are making their living on YouTube and creating amazing audiences so all of your problems are my problems your wins or my wins so we are tied at the hips and and I just love what I do I think most people collect most people's questions have to do with the Logan Paul controversies it's still very very fresh and to leave that off I'm curious what's it like for you and then what's it like inside of YouTube when something like that or any of the previous controversies happen is there a protocol in place yeah I mean we have depending on on severity of the issue at hand we have escalation processes that take place and and we're looking at you know how this how this works against the guidelines the community guidelines that we have set on YouTube which really help operate an open platform like ours there's there's quite a lot of work that goes on behind the scenes that the rest of the world doesn't see how did it how did it land on the home page I think you have there are no simple answers to that except that there was a lot of interest in that video there were a lot of search searches for it all around the world on YouTube and it ended up there I think was nine days between it happening and you guys responding to it how about you better so so we actually we had a we had a press reply the next day within in less than 24 hours but our social response was delayed and so what we were working on is we were trying to formulate our our response and of course you know with Logan and a lot of his projects for original productions there are hundreds of people involved people whose paychecks depend on it so we don't want to make a rash decision that impacts so many people's livelihood it's not just Logan many other people are cross multiple projects however we do want to be much faster we're looking at those processes and and and we want to be much more active there was a line in that statement you guys put out an unsocial that said we'll have more to share soon on the steps we're taking to ensure a video like this is never circulated and I think that line of video like this had a lot of the community questioning what that means and this is a bigger question which is how do you how do you balance kind of being the thought police saying this is okay and this is not versus free speech which is are like YouTube is stood for so much so and and you're you're hitting the nail on the head which this is one of the hardest things scaling open is developing standards making sure that users feel safe creators feel safe and advertisers feel safe obviously this video was not something that you know and I don't think anyone you know anyone is proud of proud to be associated with but we think that the more we develop our Community Guidelines the more we hone them and there will our standards along those lines we think we we can get their culture YouTube culture I've noticed sort of in the last year last year plus drama has been drama would be the descriptor out used to really drive the culture of YouTube what do you think of that I found that are you talking about the drama you create drama is rewarded with use drama is rewarded with attention drama is rewarded ultimately with dollars and I think a lot of that is what what eventually sort of metastasized into the kind of sensationalist content that let things like the Logan Paula controversy happen yeah how do you how does YouTube affect culture it to I'm talking about the incentives and disincentives for that or thinking very deeply and every single day now on how do we create the right incentives and disincentives for creators to to do the right thing on YouTube and that means a lot of different things that means do the right things for advertisers do the right things for their users you know for the platform organically and not chase sensationalism not chase views for the sake of views not use drama for the sake of use and not use drama at our expense for the sake of use it so what's at heart for us is that we deeply care about the Train Riko system that's my job if you don't succeed we don't succeed what we want to make sure that creators who are making a living on YouTube feel safe doing so you know that there's no gaming basically that it's just all about like doing the right thing and it is our job to set those guidelines in place and the incentives in place so so we're working that quite busily what kind of creators would you like to see more of on the platform are you talking about me personally or - the bigger question of culture like whoa what would you love to see ultimately is kind of the defining creator movement on the platform and how would how would you how would you to foster the kind of relationships needed to enable I so I personally like a lot of news content news related content on YouTube it just you know helps catch up on everything's going on and it's just and it has a different Flair on YouTube educational content but I don't mean the traditional educational says it's just that I I've learned something new my older daughter who became vegan and you know we didn't want them to become vegan and and and then you know them you know because it's a lot of work Penda and you know she found all the inspiration and all the arguments and how to argue and convince parents on YouTube by the way the one category I didn't mention is and we would like more and more female creators on the platform right that yeah it's it's a huge opportunity huge and and so Elle Mills have you discovered Ella Mills yet and by the way every time you told me that I remember the last time you said oh you know you gotta watch this this kind david dobrik this was like three years ago it was like he's on the rise and of course yeah so I know you'd have an eye for it so I'll make sure to follow her no but that's that's another category that we really focused on what what do we want to grow in we want everybody to grow but what do we want to grow a little bit more that maybe is underserved that maybe needs the extra push extra push in terms our attention extra push in terms of marketing count them funding whatever it is and then we put somebody on it and say build a plan they build a plan approve the plan and then they start executing against it that's really that's how the process with us works this is a big kind of this is a big question I have that I've always had which is that in all my years in television I never met a TV studio head who wasn't at one time a TV producer and in cinema I've never met a movie studio and who didn't produce movies but no one on the YouTube sort of senior executive leadership side has ever made a living as a creator so how do you how does Susan how do the other leaders at YouTube empathize with the struggles of being a creator having never been there yourself so I might not have produced myself but I just give you my little quick background I started in the mailroom of a talent agency working with writers actors directors States tickling their pictures and resumes and sending it to cast entities that Sarah became an assistant and just went to work for a production movie production financing companies have made a lot of films and and then went to HBO and launched HBO's around the world and eventually to Netflix and then to YouTube so I've been around content all of my professional career and and I've learned it from inside out and every angle so I'm deeply passionate about it I love it and that's my both my professional and personal life now when it comes to when it comes to but I have now been a YouTube creator myself when you think about YouTube it's really a massive platform it's a technology like it's massive technological feat and what you really need is people who are incredibly proficient at building an infrastructure on a you know unprecedented level all around the world of interesting 450 hours of video every single minute is streaming in billion hours a day in HD quality so what our company has to do is sort of marry the technological prowess with content prowess together and and do it at scale the changes in the partner program so you have to have four thousand hours of watch time a thousand subs to monetize a question or something I saw a lot on on Twitter was new or tiny YouTube channels seeing that is tremendously discouraging how do you how do you respond to that so we don't succeed unless you succeed if there are no great creators they're not gonna be enough users there's not enough advertisers it just it doesn't work so we we think that this level is high enough for us to learn about the partner so that we can turn the ads on them and not disappoint advertisers and at the same time that it's not so far out that it will be untenable and you know and unreachable for that we want as many creators monetizing but we also want to make sure that everybody who's monetizing is doing the right thing and and it's protective because if somebody doesn't do the right thing and are in there and that vert eyes is react in a certain way then all of you get punished that's not a good outcome because then you don't succeed we don't succeed because nobody is happy um about monetization when you guys made the changes that were made in response to ad pocalypse there's a lot of frustration a lot of frustration expected expressed on social media did you guys see that outcry coming for the false positives did it catch you off guard it was really really hard because if you're just trying to stabilize the ecosystem that's you know that's that's moving around so yes we heard the outcry of course and and it's the I can tell you there's nothing more painful than hear from the advertisers their stories and nothing more painful is than hear from the creators and and you should know both sides think that we favor the other you know and so we clearly have work to do it does feel like at times that what creators want to make what audiences want to see doesn't always align or doesn't align what advertisers want to want to buy against how do you how do you rectify that some sometimes that happens and and it's really hard to tell an advertiser look you must buy this and because they sell it guess my brand and I just don't want to you know that's their choice one of the one of the things that we worked really hard on last year was our yellow monetization icon because then really which I know might have been you know painful and worked but it was something that helped us reduce false positives by 30 percent it was really impactful you know suddenly getting getting input from creators saying look this was not correct everyone who participated let me ask you about the yellow icon because from a creator from the most cynical creator perspective what it what a few does is a way of saying we think this might not be advertiser friendly so we're gonna cut your revenue on it but we're still playing it so it's costing you the it's costing you the Creator money while we figure this out and I think that I know I as a creator found that very insulting I've known that very upsetting why do I have to take your algorithms mistake why does it have to cost me money how does YouTube address something like that at the kind of scale that I remember you are calling on this issue I think those may be October and were there yeah and and that's when we start to think about the let's let's let's you know what stole creators that they shouldn't you know published them yet have them unlisted I guess with you it's can't and and then you know they won't go through the volatility so that that has worked if you as a creator it feels like there's a lot of tension between the creator community and YouTube as a company is that is that felt do you think it's a fair statement is that felt within YouTube as a company I wouldn't want to call it tension because it would it would imply that we're on opposite sides somehow and we're not I think we're on the same side the thing that we have struggled with and you've told that to me multiple times is communication and you should know that we try so hard to communicate with creators but it's only so disheartening but like we want feedback to keep on coming but it's disheartening to hear that it's not cutting through but you should know that we don't see this tension we see it as if people are not happy we have a problem we're on the same side we need to figure out how to fix it well let me let me end then with this this this and this question this is more of a prompt than a question but I think that YouTube's never been good at saying here's what matters to us here's what we stand for and here's what to expect from us so I invite you to now just kind of use this platform as a way to tell all of us creators in the community what matters to you what do you stand for and what is next for YouTube as as a platform sure so so what we stand for is is really four freedoms freedom of opportunity anybody to make a living on YouTube you know bring revenue from the entire world and there are many wonderful examples freedom of speech as important as ever freedom of information accessing it I grew up in in communist country in Czechoslovakia behind the Iron Curtain it's really important you know the openness and freedom of speech and freedom of information is really important to me and that that is why I I love what I do and then the fourth one is freedom to belong people creating communities on YouTube that they can feel like they can share a bit more with that they may not have in person somewhere else but on the YouTube they do so we have these four core freedoms that we truly care about what what is important to us is the success of our partners the partners our creators and advertisers so to us what's most important is bringing these two communities together advertisers and creators and make sure that they all succeed and if they do we'll be fine and everything that I say is like that you know we're on your side we mean it we may not get it right you know many times or for one reason or another but the intent is always good the intent is always on your side and so hopefully we can deliver more and and truly make everybody even happier and more successful well Robert thank you for coming on and I want to say that Robert did not ask me to do this but I can't have you on Robert without plugging your book stream Punk's by reading this book I got to understand how you think of YouTube and that means a lot considering you're the one pulling all the strings and then the second thing that I like the most and I wish you had talked more about it I think it's just the first chapter of the preface or something is when you talk about your upbringing in here behind the Iron Curtain and not having any access to media at all in the first movie that you ever saw was terminator but it was dubbed and checked nanika I thought oh say Oh same here jonah had an understanding that that's where you're coming from and now that you're in the position you were in enables me to empathize with you and by proxy with youtube and more so Thank You Casey thanks for having me here to do this is Jay all right thanks for watching if you made it that far I just want to put this at the end to again Thank You Tube thank Robert for doing this and then also to encourage YouTube to do more of this there are a lot of other creators in this platform that I know would love to interview some of the senior management at YouTube and there is certainly enough controversy taking place in this platform to warrant those interviews so I know it may not make the most interesting or fun video but I do think this is an effective way for YouTube to share what the hell is going on within that company to us to the community so thanks YouTube okay tomorrow I will be back to my regular programming", "label": "G"}, {"data": "so being a youtuber it's the greatest job ever and because of this job and what I do I've gotten to do some of the most incredible things that I could have ever imagined when I was a kid and I think the greatest thing about being a youtuber about being creator having a big audience has been the people that I've gotten to meet and when I think of all the people that I get to meet like what is the most what's the most special in there at the very apex of that pyramid at the very very top has been the individuals I've gotten to meet through the make-a-wish Foundation and make-a-wish is an organization that takes very sick young people and kids and grants them a wish maybe they want to get a Disneyworld or surf in Hawaii or go to a movie set and there's been a couple of kids whose dream it's been is was to meet me and one of those young people was a young man by the name of Errol and maybe you saw the episode I'll link it below but arrow came here to the studio and we hung out and we got to know each other and he's like a fantastic musician and we went to the park and he played the piano and we had lunch with Candice and we drove around on a limousine and like greatest day ever and at the end of like this awesome day I said there was like arrow like why me like why do want to pick me I know you don't want to be a youtuber why me and he was like Casey I've seen how you can bring attention to causes you believe in and I wanted to talk to you about bringing attention to a cause that I believed in and at the end of that it was like the reason why this kid used his one wish to spend time with me is because he thought working with me would be an amazing Avenue to bring attention to others who are in need like a total act of selflessness but all he wanted to do was to help others I got just like blew my mind you know when I was his age I was like smoking pot and chasing girls and here's this young man who's sick trying to trying to spend his life to help others so so that was a that was that was many months ago that he and I connected and loosely kept in touch and kept track of Eros since we spent that wonderful day together and a family friend of his reached out to me on about a week ago letting me know Eero wasn't doing well and then they got in touch with me yesterday let me know that Errol had passed away if you watch the video below he doesn't seem sick which is it's even harder for me to really understand because um in any event he's no longer with us and you know anytime I experience a loss of life or someone I cared about our new goes away it just makes me really stop and think of what matters the most like what is most important and I love things like I get excited about all my stupid boosted boards and I get excited about like camera gear and I get excited about flying cars and and I get excited about work and I mean I'm a very I I can get obsessive about almost anything but but really what matters and the only thing that matters is my relationship are your relationships with other people something that I've I say a lot something I really believe in is that a life not shared is a life not lived if you don't share your life and share your happiness with other people and let other people into your life then are you really living then what's the point so I'm just taking pause today to stop and think about all the people in my life that I love and I appreciate and maybe you want to stop and just take a moment to think about the people in your lives that you appreciate because it's easy to get caught up in the and the and forget about what really matters I also just wanted to say I Romero's family friend they said that it was like his right up until the end he was mostly concerned with how he could help others so all linked cancer gogo which is arils nonprofit which his parents are maintaining to help kids and help people who were affected like he was I'll link that in the description below if you don't even give him a dollar they're trying to have everybody give him a dollar okay now I want to sing you a song yes sing all of you a song I'm not gonna really sing it's I can't sing but I want to share with you the lyrics of one of my favorite songs which for me puts things in perspective okay this song is called do you realize by the Flaming Lips and it's it's an incredible song but it goes this is part of it but it goes do you realize that everyone you know will someday die and instead of saying all of your good-byes let them know you realize that life goes fast it's hard to make the good things last you realize that the Sun doesn't go down it's just an illusion caused by the world spinning round okay [Music] life goes fast Hogman the good things I realize undone just in caused by the [Music] spinning", "label": "G"}, {"data": "he was a terrific guy exactly the person you thought he was mmm yeah feel selfish hello and welcome to this very special edition episode of the block we are about one month away from the four-year anniversary of Hurricane sandy the worst hurricane to hit New York City and today's episode gonna be about my experience during that night where I show all this produces I've never really shown before of lower Manhattan New York City completely underwater a little refresher october twenty night 2012 hurricane sandy hit New York City now this was the second costliest hurricane in US history never left a path of destruction all the way up the East Coast but on the twenty-ninth hit New York City now I was here at the time I lived in these village and we knew his stomach the forecast for a large and dangerous storm surge is the same as it was this morning and they'll warn the whole city they prepared us for absolute apocalypse and then like nothing happened tell me what you really think all right tell me think about this storms all right because our tickets right there was rain and a little bit of wind but this is New York City like we can handle it then towards the end of the day I was riding my bike back downtown on the west side highway and i watch the river just keep going up and up and up and up ultimately getting towards the southern tip of the island and I remember this detail vividly the southern tip the island means like it's where you can see all the water and the Statue of Liberty so it's where all the news crews were set up with their big lights and their cameras and there's this one . when the water came up over the side box that i watched all the news crews pack up their stuff pack up their van shut down their lights for the cameras an event in takeoff and they were all saying it's not safe to be down here it definitely was not safe to be down there but this is a slightly younger slightly stoopid version of me was also with my younger brother who had just gotten out of the military who convinced me that is like superior military survival training would keep us safe and then my equally reckless hockey player friend sean avery was with that lots of watches and at that point as the cameras abandoned southern Manhattan we don't fit now when I say we do then I don't mean that as a figure of speech i mean that well almost literally the water started coming up faster than we could have ever imagined definitely one of those situations where people use words like Serge you know what does that mean in a few minutes later the water is an entire foot now the middle of the city was higher ground and it wasn't wet but the edges the edges were closest to the water that's where on bikes there was a moment when we saw a guy a delivery driver and his car was stuck whatever do that was the only that was the only touching moment of the night mmm you can leave him this was like a fancy bank building and you can see the atms right there and you can also see the people who work in that building at the top of the escalator now i have reviewed this for dinner while but can you imagine being trapped in that building in seeing three guys on bikes in waist-deep water come up the window yeah this is South Street Seaport this is where there are a lot of tall buildings banks things like that this is the most shocking part of the night the water was literally at times chest-deep like this and there were no emergency personnel anywhere no cops no firemen there was there nothing powered out in parts of the city we could see the fire engines alt but we were also very very alone this is the West Side Highway this is an eight-lane Highway it was completely under water from one side to the other yeah remember we got this fancier neighborhood in lower Manhattan and there was a car under water there are a lot of cars under water but there was one car underwater with flashing headlights it was a Bentley this is like a couple hundred thousand dollar car and somebody had left it out and it was submerged underwater well yeah who has a bentley and leaves it out in one of the worst hurricanes in new york city's history yeah yeah good luck all right around midnight I said goodbye my little brother I said your body Sean and my plan was to come here to the studio and edit this video like it was yesterday I remember riding my bike down Broadway one of the busiest streets in new york city in all the power on the west side of the street was out one side of the street pitch-black the other side was still lit the other side stored power and that's where my office was a couple blocks from my office on my bike and all the sudden like all the lights on this side of the street went out in that same moment for the first time ever my phone got the emergency alert and i traveled to read it said get indoors in that moment for me was sheer terror it was dead silent it was pitch-black I was completely alone in this city I've never felt so vulnerable is weird because the first time ever including up until now first time ever i've been completely alone in New York City in the absolute darkness by flashlight was the only source of light that was a moment of absolute terror for me cannons that were married yet but I said on the mission to go find her and on my way to her apartment i saw a large group of people gathered around this building I wouldn't check it out the entire facade the entire front of this building had collapsed that was my last experience of the night that's what i said this I was found Candice and sort of hung up my camera for the night if there's an epilogue this movie would be that I was in fact the only one to get that footage and because of that there are a lot of companies that wanted it so i ended up licensing the footage to HBO weather channel national Geographics all the news people and I took all that money from licensing this footage and we bought clothes and supplies and I've been donated them to the victims of the hurricane ok this concludes today's special presentation i hope you enjoyed it yeah", "label": "G"}, {"data": "you're too heavy I typically get running shoes three pair at a time see I've got a metal leg flat feet and I run I land on my heels so these shoes look good see that see how the heels all melted away you don't want to run on shoes like this because it can mess up your home so once every six months so I have to get new shoes today's the day three new pair showed up I wear a parent next day rotate next day rotate back to the first pair and repeat this is something that a pro Runner friend taught me you see that the foam in the shoe it doesn't recover in a day it needs a couple days to recover after a long run so you got a multiple shoes so it is anybody who watches this show care about this stuff an unpaid and probably unwanted advertisement for my favorite coffee shop Thank You coffee [Music] thanks for letting me use your cars inside [Music] it's really nice in here good for meeting slicing Tom great windows this staff is only super chill except for when they catch me filming and they've got good snacks like sandwiches and vegan muffins if you're into that kind of thing but mainly it's just the best cup of coffee they're gonna get like a 10-block radius of three six eight hey this is mine yeah thank you [Music] so that's my unsolicited unasked-for commercial advertisement for think talking come grab yourself [Music] so much so much to talk about recently but let's have let's have this conversation up in the office [Music] remember the office up here the one by the bathroom the one where there was a hole here that went into the room there i'm happy to say the office is nearly complete ready first time ever sliding door dreams to comes through little steps out here you go we've got a secure ish railing it's the progress in the door [Music] see as of two weeks ago when I announced this new series and I announced the whole 368 initiative and all of our ambitions at that time all that existed was a big empty space and an idea and in the last two weeks it's evolved to a big empty space with some construction work done and a slightly more mature idea see when building something that has the the scale the ambition of what I and soon we are trying to do here at 3 6 8 it obviously takes time but there's also there's also a structure to how that time is spent and what the priorities are initial priorities in here are making it so we can actually work in here hence the office being nearly done and then another priority that's at the very very top is the team and we have made some progress on the team not ready to announce yet but there's a couple of key people that are now on or close to being on that will help me run and realize that the mission and and just operate this its operation what has been particularly interesting to me are what aspects of three six a people have been responding to the most whether it's on social media or in the comments on YouTube the one thing that stands out is this idea of enabling and helping small creators which is something that I'm tremendously passionate about but seeing out people react to that has been well it's been overwhelming overwhelming for a lot of reasons overwhelming because I know how to help creators when it comes to creators that maybe I stumble upon or seek me out that are just making incredible work I get excited and I talk about them and I share them with this audience they grow because of that that is not something that's scalable plugging people on this channel is not an effective way to grow a lot of people so figuring out what that infrastructure might look like what this idea of enabling others might actually feel like might actually be like that's something that I've been spending a lot of time thinking about and that is something that I think the future of 368 could be instrumental in the planning and the execution of every aspect of three six ages compartmentalised one piece get it done they move on to the next they move on to the next they move on to the next you build something small you see if that works you add on to that you see if that works you add on to that you see if that works you add on to that that's the effective way to build a business and that's exactly trying to do at 368 the hardest part of that for me is that it doesn't make for really interesting content I mean to show you the nuances everything is transpiring in 3 6 8 every single day would be about the video equivalent of showing you paint dry the steps are all tiny but in aggregate they're meaningful all things start small all great things start small cicero said that and that is that's that's what's going on right now at 368 from both the physical perspective and an ambition that you do it in an ambition perspective and everything in between but the train is moving forward we've got greater direction and understanding now and it seems like it feels like every day that passes by we have more clarity on how to execute on what we're trying to accomplish [Music] Jesse I got a serious question for you yes all right I know I've been yapping a lot today but I think it's time for me to answer the question that every single person the question that every single person on Twitter and in the youtube comments and everywhere else has asked which is why the suit there is not much of an answer like there's not much of a reason for me wearing a suit I guess it goes like this well you know what come here bring it when I was thinking of starting 3 6 8 and in starting a new Daily Show here I knew there'd be no disassociating this new daily vlog with my daily vlog from the past that's why all of you know me in the first place is from that vlog how does this feel different so one idea I had was like what if at the beginning I'm always wearing a suit and then at first glance you know that this is 3 6 8 and not the vols ok that's kind of it it's like there's not much more to it than that yes I'm a fan of Reservoir Dogs yes I think it's cool that the Yakuza wear the same outfit no I don't think it's cool that when I go to restaurants people think I'm a waiter no it's not really comfortable and then yesterday this is embarrassing but yesterday yesterday Candice finally admitted to me that uh she doesn't find the suit to be handsome anymore so that was kind of it I'm sorry there isn't a more intellectual response for why I'm wearing a suit there's not there's really not much more to it I think now that I've told you that I can probably stop wearing the suit I'm I am worried that once I don't have the suit on there'll be some confusion as to what it is you're watching but see this is from the old vlog so I think you're gonna get compute there better awesome I know I'll check I'll tell you all about this soon see I got a serious question for you yes should I put the suit back on people were starting to like question the suit and I'm doing a lot of peer pressure to stop wearing it what do you think don't stop the suit because you want to save out but every day looks good what about this sweatshirt this is more like that's nice too they give you one of these yet no yeah no yeah [Music] it's a brute Stood Still have you had your box of Ding Dongs yesterday I think I'm done with the suit [Music] on tomorrow's episode of three six eight back to work in my mouth ha ha [Music]", "label": "G"}, {"data": "I cannot wait that's why I came to Vegas I fly home tomorrow morning after I get my plate I'm out of here not even hitting the craps tables we gotta hit the craps table one it was like an hour an hour at the craps table after swish our flights back its 6:52 a.m. on a Thursday in New York City at John F Kennedy Airport and I'm currently on their way to Las Vegas this is not like a bachelor party trip or like a party trip or a gambling trip this is more about science so yes science I'll explain when I get there I got a I got a go to bed now ladies and gentlemen get low intellect with me Las Vegas local time is 5 10 22 and [Music] they have slot machines in the airport here I'm in that hotel room now and I and I am going to explain to you exactly what I'm doing here in Las Vegas but first I need to show you this hotel room Justin the last thing I've talked to you about yesterday was that I would be happy to sleep on the couch if you wanted to just get one small room for us to share yeah what is this absurdity Elaine wouldn't haven't allow me to show you this hotel remain a brief tour of the hotel room this is the coffee maker breakfast table living room number one living room number two guess this is like a bar place a kitchen but we made it our office foosball room bathroom number one stairwell hallway master bedroom awesome bathroom number two bathroom number three bathtub number one bedroom number two this is a steam shower number two I think that concludes the tour of the justin hotel room today's place justin Larry Tate is a single-seat flying machine it's a 250 pound vehicle called flyer think pontoon plane mixed with drone you fly it over the water the company behind it called Kitty Hawk is funded by the Google co-founder run by self-driving car pioneer Sebastian turn oh my god yep so that's what we're doing here Larry Page the co-founder of Google has this side project that's like to build a fly it's not a drone no it's like a tiny flying car ultralight aircraft I think that's how they got approval to actually fly it okay but no one has flown it they just announced that this thing exists this morning they invited me out here and because Justin built the human flying drone I'm like this is the best aeronautics expert I know he has to be there today we're going for training yeah they're gonna show us how it works we're not here right I don't think so I think that's the first thing tomorrow morning today we're gonna train and then tomorrow morning at 3 a.m. we're gonna fly it and that's we're doing here science [Music] you sure you know how to handle this thing me not know you can worst driver on planet Earth [Music] [Music] within like a couple of hours you are going to be 100% capable of flying this vehicle this feels like a total like mission impossible area 51 approach and we're in this Lagoon outside of Las Vegas well done a little ways here little oasis yeah just we need to reveal yeah that's the big reveal okay ready it's like a PlayStation controller can I say that it's like a PlayStation controller [Music] the goal is to make flying absolutely easy something that you can learn to do in a couple hours [Music] this is the simulator right I'm gonna now go in the simulator and learn how to virtually fly the flier is that that factor okay I'm now getting in the simulator right here all right I'm ready fathers start to ramp down will start to slow down and then you can purchase it out so those are the basic functions for flying you and it I was really paying attention yeah yes it felt extremely intuitive this might be a reach but it seems easier to fly them like a Mavic drone there's less axes I'm also trying their controller I can yeah you don't yeah and like you don't have to think about once you've set your altitude you don't have to I mean the consequences they're just slightly higher than flying a 600 are drones but it felt as intuitive jacked this is the part where I sit in that flyer right there we're not going up at all right it's anchored but it's gonna spin [Music] alright this is it this is the last bit of emergency training what what exactly is going on here this looks like Chuckie Cheese so this is the last part of emergency procedures training this is our dry lake it is full of colorful balls we're gonna put you in and we're going to spit it upside down and have you release the seatbelt and get out done all right again just wait so we're done flipping then release and swim out of the driveway all right we'll go that way it will count to three one two three down and knowing what it feels like okay that's it for me [Music] [Applause] [Music] all right that's it that's all the training tomorrow morning I'll be flying you tune in tomorrow to see me fly that flying plot in the flying what do you call a Cheston flying car flier define taxi I think is what they're calling it - I'll post that's a separate video I'll post that tomorrow see [Music] you [Music]", "label": "G"}, {"data": "yeah that's via that's the GoPro common play right there ok referred through some real test now everybody here today's entire episode is going to be about gear to his friends first day at school by herself oh my god gear haven't talked about gear in awhile this entire episode you can be focused on gear if you're an interesting camera gear come back tomorrow for our regularly scheduled programming that my thesis on gear is pretty straightforward I've shared it with you a million times i always want the very best image possible so long as it doesn't get in the way of me living my life we're doing my thing now what that literally means is like this like when I walk into I walk into an airplane and I'm carrying my big blogging camera which looks like this the flight attendant says hey you can't have that there's no filming in here it gets in the way when I walk onto an airplane holding this so this is the thing they just assume that I'm a nerd who has two talking to a camera in there are other places we just can't bring a camera into I just use my cell phone that's what i mean by the best image possible as long as it doesn't get in the way the gist of this whole thesis is that this five-thousand-dollar camera is often not as good as this $1,500 camera this $59 camera is often not as cute as 500 our camera less good than this 200 our camera and this tune our camera at time is not as good as the camera on my cell phone you see when the story is king and the story is always King these things just serve this story and whatever one of these can tell your story the best is the best camera now I've said all this before why am i repeating myself today today is a very special day today is well in the world of drones about if you're a longtime viewers of this show you know how conflicted my relationship has been with drones i still use this like toy drone because of its convenience this was the only one that fit into my backpack equip the image quality on that thing is like a bad cell phone camera but this thing has been amazing it produces incredible results it looks like we've got a helicopter following me around it's not super manageable in fact this is a regular backpack and this is the pack that's meant to carry the Phantom for its kind of the only way to keep but it's like the only way to keep it safe now going back to where I started about having the gear get in the way of you telling your story i gave up on keeping that thing safe and I just take the propellers off and cream and my normal size backpack that is in part the reason why i have 127 broken ones what is the best answer to like the camera conundrum but with drones I don't know and I don't know if it's been answered yet but today gopro announced their new drone and maybe that's it Oh what can it be yeah so much more than a drug now i happen to have one right here so I thought we'd take a look just as a disclaimer this is not a commercial for or was paid for by or is an endorsement of anything for gopro they just gave me the opportunity to check out this early prototype so this this is the actual drone itself this here this is the battery fully charged battery into drone feels pretty good now the magic the drone wings actually just flip out on this so this big guy collapse it down to something far more manageable even with the propellers on there something big here that's different is the fact that instead of having a set of having a fixed camera is actually this is a GoPro on the front now I don't know what that better or if that's worse because i haven't flown this sucker yet but no just for a quick size size comparison you can see here the manageability is favors the GoPro in a big way because the cameras on the front here it means the legs could actually be smaller and pulled out in the bottom because they're not responsible for protecting the camera like here all right and this is the gimbal here this is what keeps the image totally steady symbol here gimbal here but this is what GoPro did that's totally next level ready the gimbal actually ok you turn this like this and then just slide it out the gimbals pops out you take this little guy and then you've got a handheld gimbal that gets totally study handheld footage and it's the same it's the same this is the same symbol that works with it's the same gimbal that works on the drone i can now use an attached to stuff i'm not going to pack up the drone take the gimbal skate to somewhere where I can find fly the drone and test the gimbal also I didn't show you the controller so haven't used it yet but one day I'm totally psyched about it doesn't your phone like this is the whole touch screen here controls here buttons here buttons here it's kind of like a gigantic gameboy alright thrown in backpack there this is the custom custom backpack that comes with no gonna try something right I'm going to try to skate there with this thing on with this thing on my chest alright this little guy right here it's stabilized and it's rolling it was just able to stop the entire stabilizer to my chest pretty cool yeah all right full disclosure this is the maiden flight my maiden flight probably the universe maiden flight of a girl from karma in the wild I've read no instruction manuals and I've had no instructions on this thing here's what we're dealing with here I get the nice screen of available twenty patients yes not yet obtained off i'm leveling irobot here we go you what what yeah this thing is fast yeah ok is far against is like business is like the only GoPro karma prototype on planet earth right now and I've got like a mile from me things up town okay bring it back at 21 minutes left in this flight so i think it's time to step it up a little bit and try something a little bit more complex that is the operating the drone while flying the boosted board as my first time on this thing so this will be telling all right wish me luck yeah so that's it that is the first look at the GoPro karma drone system stable that was unfinished product the software wasn't finalized so I'm gonna reserve giving you my judgment on it but i can say this it's very very exciting that that is where things are headed like in one backpack is essentially like a fork a Steadicam a helicopter with a stabilized camp like if you had told the younger version of me don't have all of that available to me in a backpack I wouldn't believe you all right full disclosure here obviously by the way I anymore after you push the red button here this is colin from GoPro he's sort of been supervising my visit today with the prototype Karma's I've been telling him like don't tell me how to use this let me figure this thing out but these are but I don't get to keep these when i get one so we said today they'll be available in October 23rd when I said I didn't get any instructions or anything I mean it when I said that I had not been given any instructions i really want to try this thing without anybody teaching me how do thank you for letting me play with it my pleasure thanks for going up we always love Sharon stop with you Casey I'm very impressive to ride a boosted board that little practice something", "label": "G"}, {"data": "you think you'd be happy there sure I think I'd be happier there than I would be in LA I'm a hundred percent certain I'd be happy now Candace wants to move to Texas we don't first of all we only be two and half hours from a family are we getting coffee yeah actually yeah I know this conversation about leaving New York City and moving

city with two kiddos and just be a lot thank you [Music] goodbye pregnant you mean princess princess oops sorry my car hit that car [Music] this right here it's a new monitor the old one died after

go die before she gets here because [Music] okay so for today's tech review Tuesday I got you juice thank you I got you juice all right let's see it's called love at first sight but look it's really it's like the healthiest healthy one they make yeah and this one is tasty too what is this it says your name on it Marlon no no I said you see this draw I love you yeah it looks nice right it looks exactly like you yeah okay I think that was for false starts now I can start tech review Tuesday dan roll the intro today in tech review Tuesday we're gonna talk to cell phones now I'm gonna be reviewing the one plus six which I just got not even opened yet before I do my general thoughts on cell phones as of June 2018 goes like this my favorite mobile phone operating system is pure Android running on the pixel 2 but I still carry an iPhone because an iPhone has iMessage and FaceTime which are the best messaging and video television on the market also the iPhone goes to the Apple watch which integrates pretty well with the running apps that I use my favorite cell phone camera is the samsung galaxy s 9 it's the best low it's just the best cell phone camera on the market right now but it's still not my favorite phone my favorite phone is still the Samsung Note 8 and it's the best because because it has a stylus and S Pen and it operates more like a computer than a phone and that makes it my favorite now a look at the 1 plus 6 [Music] right off the bat it's got one Hardware feature that I think should be required on every phone made and that has a physical switch that takes it from ringer to vibrate we're reaching a point with cell phones where at least from the front they all looked the same just kind of slide the glass curve the glass back on the oneplus does feel pretty sexy it's got a notch in the top right there like an iPhone one thing it does have that super interesting is that when you use the provided charger this thing goes from zero to a full day's charge in 30 minutes at least that's what they say just a quick thought for all cell phone manufacturers on planet Earth we as consumers will always prefer a slightly longer battery life to a phone that's like a millimeter thinner okay let's compare the size differences here are fairly negligible this is the one plus now as I was setting up the phone to go to a quick photo test I set up the facial recognition the facial scanner the face to unlock like the iPhone 10s it seems pretty great seems to work about as well as the iPhone 10 one thing it does have that the iPhone 10 does not have though is a fingerprint scanner and addition to the facial scanning so I like the idea of having that the redundancy in case I've got glasses or a motorcycle helmet or something blocking my face there's still the fingerprint scanner there now this is by no means a super comprehensive camera quality test but there's some amazing light out this afternoon so I'm just gonna take the same picture across these four phones that's the pixel to excel the iPhone 10 the Samsung Galaxy S 9 and then the one plus 6 and I can't stress how lovely the light is right now so I'm sure all these pictures gonna look great okay [Music] this is more of a challenging lighting condition this is to test out the dynamic range minigolf [Music] all right now I'm gonna do an indoor test I just need a I'll go get another juice so the lighting in here is like your typical indoor lighting so let's let's just the hard one all right so this would be the last photo test I do this is just your basic selfie photo nothing special about this I'm just gonna turn it on selfie smile and take a picture all right and that concludes the photo test portion of this review I gotta say out of this go back to the studio so overall the camera's not bad I think that compared to the pixel 2 or the iPhone 10 or the Samsung S 9 it's not quite as good these are the top cell phone cameras on the market right now and I think the the 1 plus 6 is is good it's definitely good enough it's definitely better than most cameras of last year's generation but it doesn't it doesn't take the prize for the best camera on the market so in conclusion in conclusion is that this is not a fully comprehensive review this was more of an unboxing because I just got this thing I'm going to take my sim card out of this and put it into this to test it out for the next week or so and I'll do a little update not as a tech review Tuesday but just as like a part of a different episode to let you know what I really think of this cell phones remain my single favorite piece of technology if you're interested in working in media youtuber filmmaker photographer you can literally build an entire career using nothing but your cellphone's alright I'll see you tomorrow on 3 6 8 [Music]", "label": "#"}, {"data": "freaking out totally morning didn't really have time for a run this morning can do a long run this afternoon can use this

laps behind i tried a child being dizzy out there man i'm gonna go at my eyes case you guys to meet you nice to meet you i'll see you on the Internet good to meet you gentlemen we ask you later bye until next time guys and really eaten all day what an awesome time in Brazil all right all packed up goodbye fabulous hotel room it is now eleven thirty five pm and I'm head to the airport take it off the trailer", "label": "G"}, {"data": "what's up making movies well yeah what y'all doing make it move I got a void that needs filling and some time to kill why don't you move me a key go by and I'll cover the bit cuz you know I spent money I don't have and if I was throw me all the French's I don't grab but the water on the way down I don't contribute day 1 when you would say myself ok early morning bagel run I've got some kind of kind of bad news about 368 I mean sighs it's not that big of a deal but it just kind of sucks see construction was supposed to start today with like contractors and construction workers and plans and architects and all that stuff but I just found out last night that um there's like an issue with our insurance so we had to delay by like maybe a week maybe up to ten days I guess it's not that big of a deal it just kind of sucks but here at 368 we do things by the books we don't take chances we follow the rules now I have always said that the gear doesn't matter when it comes to telling stories making videos YouTube and everything in between the story you tell is always more important than what you used to tell it steven soderbergh big like Hollywood movie director he's the guy who directed Ocean's eleven and like 20 other huge movies he shot his latest feature film like a proper thriller movie theater horror movie he shot a lot of cell phone and he's famously said that the future of filmmaking is on cell phones and that's the vision I really subscribe to so I think it's something that that's accessible to all of us and it's also a very good segue to a new segment that's going to come to you every Tuesday here on three six eight called tech review Tuesday Dan roll your new sweet intro Casey asked me to make some sort of a kick-ass intro phrase tech Tuesday segment but I completely forgot I'm not really worried there because he's not gonna see this until this video goes alive next week's tech Tuesday intro sequence will be sick I promise hope you guys like that intro Dan's been working on it all week long all right now on Facebook I've been seeing this video pop up like had a really annoying video you notice for this hyper zoom lens that you can put on your cell phone [Music] and watching that just like there's no teen way that thing works so I went ahead and ordered one record of a better world together with you a lot of stuff in this box I got this whole kit off of Amazon for thirty-five dollars and 49 cents maybe that's why I'm so skeptical of it okay back to the unboxing [Music] at 35 bucks I just don't trust that if you have to do what they say it's gonna be able to do but I maintain open mind [Music] made it up before I'm giving me the dishes water and the cup don't get too much for this bins and there's two people around me acquaintances to the game and I'm enjoying someone chuck is over to a good man I'm enjoying someone's kids out which way to grin I mean it's a chilling April day Sam it's a little dramatic draw goggles face faster I need someplace like cinematic I think in the far into this pier so this goes on to here presumably like centered perfectly okay and now this just kind of screws on that on there oh and then one of those is an adapter maybe make it wider dude I can't believe you actually fell for like one of those Facebook ads like you see them all the time you're like that's just garbage it's like it's the new as-seen-on-tv thing but yeah you actually bought it and dude if you actually get this centered properly I let's test it all right so this you be a side-by-side comparison of the $35 Facebook infomercial lens on a cell phone in a $1000 super zoom lens on a TV $700 Canon camera body [Music] [Music] [Music] well color me impressed it's not a total piece of for 35 bucks as like sort of a gag but it it actually works that's the thing that you put it on and you can get what is a 20x zoom on here 18 X zoom shot diversity is wildly underrated when it comes to making YouTube videos and having a long lens is important and if all you have is a cell phone this could prove helpful so I very gently very reluctantly recommend this total piece of thirty-five dollar lens because it sort of almost works [Music] now we have a fun family activity planned for the afternoon I got a food that needs fell into some time to kill why don't you move me a key go by and I'll cover the bit cuz you know I'm gonna spend the money I don't have and if almost throw me all that branches I don't grab put the water in the bottom boil go ahead at the bottom and I'll float to the top bar right crystal commercial Liberty Science Center it's like a Children's Museum the trick to this place is you come about two hours before closing that way no one else is here Brandon what do I need to show my daughter in here how old is your daughter three three yeah she definitely needs to keep playing with the Train okay I would take her downstairs to the third floor go to eat erbium that's our miniature zoom and if she's over 42 inches you could definitely go on your penny come over here all right thank you you're welcome all right oh man I don't know who gave me two it could be you it could be someone else you could put it on yours or put it on the shelf I could go it alone or I could use some help I could bring you home or I could bring myself and if me to go I'll probably listen to you find myself all by myself again with nothing to do write it down this hall look I'm sorry honey you're not tall enough that's perfect [Music] oh you don't tell them hi is it Archer ready okay [Music] I'm tired and unsure as to whether to talk to you I tried before but only managed to Bajoran LA come you look so confident when you written that a bite song hard and flinch cuz I've been that what were you today man sleeping these edits are the best thing we've ever done the best thing work we've ever done now you bite hard on bright shots and finds myself on tomorrow's episode of three six eight [Music]", "label": "#"}, {"data": "[Music] it's crazy out here [Music] 15 degrees colder than it was yesterday hey I've got a question somebody sent this to Candace and me like a few months ago or many months ago this cute picture of Francine it's like in this lightbox situation it feels like that is pretty red cable we don't know who sent it to us but we love it if you send it to us thank you [Music] [Music] thank you where you going to synchronous super eclectic this is a that's that's a fear that this is like a CNN event what is this this is like a sales event it is a sales event the National Turner's about six hundred folks here so don't know about Casey yet this is so it's I'm a surprise do you have any advice for me when it comes this of mine your relationship with CNN I don't know not super he'll say okay no so this is a this is the CNN thing it's a big huge sales meeting conference they asked me to come and talk site to do it I haven't met any of these people yet so this is a good way for me to get to know them they feed out there oh when it's done press this red button and then you can turn it off with this way but just film me walking out later Anderson wait they just called me [Applause] [Music] [Applause] a lot of a lot of interest in what cameras I'm using in these current episodes everything's in 4k now I think everything looks better it's crispy or it's cleaner the colors are better so let me get into it real quick alright so every episode I literally think every single episode of the vlog was shot on this bad boy they can in ATD before it I use the Canon 70d the last couple of days that have been shot on this little guy this is the Sony a 65 hundred and then these studio formal shots are on a 7s or a seven are two main reason why I switched from Canon to Sony is 4k I was super reluctant to actually use this little guy I thought if I'm gonna use Sony code the big guys a lot of vloggers like Louie and Ben Brown and people like that and Jesse Jesse uses this huge thing to vlog with which the image on this is almost indistinguishable from the image on this when shooting in like good to average shooting conditions low-light this thing's still better altogether I do prefer the Sony's over the canons with two major exceptions one is I do like like the native color profile of Canon better I can color grade this and I still think this looks great but there's something about this that I like better and then too is the front-facing screen it's like it's much harder to actually vlog with this thing with it not having a front-facing screen I mean you're just basically shooting blind the entire time which brings me to why I'm talking about this today the single biggest problem with not having a front-facing screen is when you think you think you're shooting with a super wide angle but it's actually zoomed all the way in and you're just getting a close-up shot of your nose I don't need a zoom lens to see this nose now with Canon that's not a big deal I would have and then I could see that it was although you just see I could correct the fact that it was oom doll the way in I've been struggling to come up with the solution I'm not gonna put an external screen on this like I need to be able throw this thing around I think I figured out how to do it and this white pen contains the solution okay I know what you're thinking now at a glance you know if these white stripes are lined up here then it's as wide as it'll go if you look at the camera and it's like that you're like oh zoomed in BAM like that and it's as wide as it'll go and you never need to check I hope that makes sense I know it's wide right now because these white stripes are lined up I know it's tight right now because the white stripes are not lined up it's all about the white stripes [Music] fine by the way I'm fine let me introduce this this is Kyle what's up this is Jack hey Kyle is the inventor and founder of one wheel Jack's just a guy who's really good at riding one wheels but you sent me the first one so I sort of owe you that was what like two years ago this is not mail time this is something else because I'm pretty sure I know what this is it is what I think it is holy good God you yeah so we need more speed so well I just want to know if it's possible on my one little tart tire okay lead me helmets I just like to give a shout out to my sponsors [Music] these guys are going but the reason why they're here is because I ordered a new one wheel Plus this is the latest and greatest there in towns they personally delivered it for me I was gonna be like a whole unboxing and testing video today but kind of feel like my hips is there anything is there anything that should tell the audience about the one wheel plus you can order one wheel plus at what wheel com yeah it's like a little too pitchy I don't know that I'm going to put it is music the rest is peace it is dude more than labor it is loved more than enjoyment [Music] really clouds have met those guys I mean Kyle the CEO has backgrounds as an engineer but just entrepreneurs that a crazy idea to build up build something and then they just

I always thought these things were so weird whoever actually used one of these even the relatively normal ones seemed like the work of lunatics you always see it in movies and stuff but I don't know a single person who's actually used one of these hey they must have sold at one point otherwise they wouldn't have made so many today we're gonna be reviewing some of the weirdest workout videos I could

self-expression it's about nonviolent it's about conservation it's about three things that I don't know how they're related to each other or related to exercise or horses so in their own words prancercise registered is defined as a springy rhythmic way of moving forward similar to a horse's gait this form of movement along with dietary and spiritual principles can create the most satisfying holistic and successful bullshit program one could hope to experience men you don't even have to be good in this world you've got to put words together in a funny way here we go let's do prancercise

in shot counts as a mention what's good Marky Mark loungin here with rich medical gold's gym this was no handshakes in the video you know the biggest question people ask me is why am i doing a fitness

underwear and trying to sell my body do people ask you about that mark concerned ask the curious ask what kind of ask but I think I've accomplished a lot of a lot proud of so you know why not share with people the important thing to remember is just starting with you that that is the face of a man trying to figure out how Mark Wahlberg's got a workout video he's just staring straight down at it smart I understand it's shameless but Christ Wow what's up mr. monk peacock D I'm done working out I love you mark why I love you Mark Wahlberg I love you it's only love little bit of hatred look I

you more anymore halted because the one no-bid unhealthy [Music]", "label": "R"}, {"data": "[Music] they're literally jackhammering outside my office today I apologize if the sound in this episode is [Music] Danny and I met in South Africa I was down there visiting Candace's family and he really like showed me around Cape Town and showed me all the awesomeness that kid that had to offer and when he told news come to New York City I kind of promised and I'd be like his tour guide I'd show them around and one aspect of that I've just been absolutely failing at is showing them good places to eat so today I take the end of my favorite breakfast restaurant as part one of its 50 part series called KC die sets guide to out-of-towners to me she's you know sets guide to New York City are you ready for this no I don't even know what you're getting the best breakfast in New York City yes I got all this I got all this herb I got I got all the syrup I got all the serve I got I got all the Sara that juice dan how was it that was incredibly delicious but if I keep on eating like this I'm gonna be like Rob - I'll see you at 360 trying to keep away from existentialism John and Earth are trying to keep away from issues flip on the off since walk in the park of discovery I will now read a monologue I didn't write this monologue but it's pretty spot-on [Applause] [Music] so the person who emailed me this morning with a perfectly nice request I'm sorry to say the answer is no you didn't do anything wrong you were perfectly respectful within your rights to ask about arranging a time for a meeting see but the problem isn't you there's something wrong with me I have a form of anorexia don't be alarmed it's not serious although I take it quite seriously in fact in fact I think it's the secret to all of my success I have calendar anorexia I want as little in my calendar as possible I'm meticulous about it whatever the least amount possible I can have in my calendar without killing my entire career that's what I want I want to set up quick call to chat want to have coffee next week let's get together to discuss no no and no I could but I just can't even if there are serious opportunities even if the only take me 15 minutes even if it's something that everyone else does I like to avoid it of course I'm not perfect at this I do succumb just like everybody else in the modern world there are things that I have to do and and those things have to be scheduled there are requirements for work and basic civility but even then when I pull up my phone and I click on today's date and I see little boxes of time blocked out I get very nervous I get anxious what is all this where did my time go what about my day why did I agree to all of this and then the most fearful question how will I be able to make my video you see my entire day is my vlog time I can't schedule that and if I do schedule that away it better be because I'm getting paid or I really want to do it because everything else everything else is for suckers see you've got managers and you got makers there are two ways to run your life managers know that their days divided up into little itty-bitty pieces for meetings calls and administrative tasks makers on the other hand makers need to have large blocks of uninterrupted time to focus on what it is they're making when people ask how I'm able to get these videos done every single day my calendar and erect SIA is the answer same goes the house able to manage a healthy relationship with my wife and my family and how I manage to exercise and read time time is our most irreplaceable asset we can't buy more of it we can't get a second of it back we can only hope to waste as little of it as possible while we have it yet somehow we treat it as the most renewable of all resources so if the ask is if we can get together and chat or pick my brain the answer is no I'm sorry but I have this condition I hope you understand okay I didn't write that it's not amazing my friend Ryan Holliday is a brilliant writer he's the one who wrote that he's good so I said hi and while I'm not as Extreme as like that letters written there's a lot in there that I do agree with after time with my family and focusing on my family this blog is my number one priority and it does make it hard or frustrating what's up harder frustrating to try and have meetings or give time to everybody who asks for some of my time but every once in a while there's a really good exception to that rule what's up Casey my name is jack conte I am the CEO of patreon but actually this is not a patreon video this is just me and you I've got an idea and I want to talk to you [Music] this is it Casey this is it I'm asking for 50 minutes of your time just you and me so I can explain this idea and I hope you're down because I already bought my plane ticket so if you're not I'm gonna be really lonely on Thursday in New York if you are down just write a comment in this youtube video that just says yes and I'll figure out how to get in touch a few up that video was made by a guy named jack conte now I don't know Jack I don't know who he is I've never met him as far as I know I've never seen the guy before and before I could gather from that video he wants something from me but that video was just so so good that I got to meet the guy how good was it well it was so good that the video itself went viral it was so good that he recruited people all over the internet to petition me just to go meet him it was so good so good that the man right now is outside my office door holy crap oh my oh my god I wish everybody could see what it looks like in here this is Jack what's up Jack woody what do you want what do I want what do you want that is so important that you made a video that's that good to get my attention well ultimately what I want is I want creative people to be valued what they're actually valued at I want I want there to be a zero gap between what a creative person is worth and the money that they are given by the world that's the noble mission yes I want all creators to be able to make a living doing what they love which is I assume creating so how do you realize that well just a pitch for patreon no I don't want to pitch me okay okay Jack is the CEO of a company called patreon patreon patreon patreon is a site if you don't know we're like let me know if this is the fare carry it to it yeah patreon is a site where you can like make your own account and then if people like you and they like your YouTube channel they can subscribe to you on patreon and support you by that good yeah they give you much like it's like a you get a membership platform wait I I don't like to I can't why don't you find my pitch but not like this do you want to fill in the pitch can you give it a brief yet it fits my audience they're dying to know this video Jack had 11,000 subscribers he uploaded this video to his channel it went crazy viral it did 600 700 thousand views you're up to fifty nine hundred thousand views nine hundred thousand views you know how many subscribers you are now 50 thousand and fifty thousand people are so curious to hear what you wanted to share with me I need to I have I'm a storyteller Casey I have I built a whole story you're on an elevator with my with my 9 million subscribers you want them to believe in what you're sharing pink bum you've got 14 floors go okay this is like Shark Tank Casey three six eight guys the potential to be most badass media company in the world the old-school style amazing media companies I'm talking about like the late the labels that actually helped developed an artist help them reach an audience help them make money that's what three six eight can actually do you're talking about helping small creators three six eight can be a platform for small creators like no black record label in the world can actually do you can actually help people find and build an audience literally no one in the world can do that three six eight is positioned to be literally a historical media company that can help connect people with the world okay so here's the patient go here's the pitch this is I need to tell you my story I need I need my deck okay okay guys so far this is pretty impressive stuff coming from Jack we're gonna go ahead and hit pause so I can read his deck now I'm gonna turn the camera off turn the camera off attach in the camera all right that was an hour of the two of us talking I feel like progress was made we made a lot of progress 1 2 3 6 8 let's see 3 6 8 welcome to 3 6 8 oh my god [Music] so this is the main space and obviously we're gonna use this space for like collabs and just like a party space in a physical space up here there that's with no no behind you that's where the office is being built see them up there the constructions almost done up there progress is being made dude it's so weird to actually be here so you can imagine like this is where I wanted to podcast and set up back here out there I don't know but I feel like downstairs is about post-production clean organized and upstairs about like horsing around and action you can see the vision right baby's down you know like the office is built the office is a reality now and then we're gonna start working on down here and then upstairs and then and how long is it going to take to actually get the facility up and running weeks and months but not longer than that this isn't a this isn't a five-year plan this is like a couple month to it glad somebody else appreciates this phase as much as I do so I think while the good news is I don't know it's not that we have a deal or don't have a deal but what Jack came here to present is wildly exciting and I could see it I do see it I want it to be a big part of three six eight future so what do you think I think I'm pretty excited right now appreciate you thank you sir this is very exciting this is all about the future of 368 and what we could do together and I'm spinning I gotta go on tomorrow's episode of three six eight [Music]", "label": "G"}, {"data": "[Music] that's a chance at what in this

you luck with your YouTube channel thanks for the pillows Paula hope the air nanos ah their headphones expect a comprehensive okay this is what I was looking for all right so like literally two years ago 2015 when I was first trying to fly drones and this vlog and I didn't actually fly drones I would just crash drones in every single episode I'll just crash the drones my sauce video for a drone that was super portable it's super easy to fly and all that stuff so I bought it right i pre-ordered it and this is snap the world's first fully portable 4k flying two years later it has shown up this will now be a comprehensive review [Music] you know the thing that excited me the most was it small compact size at the time the only drone out there was like the Phantom three which is pretty enormous and this seemed tiny but in between the tiers since they announced it and shipped it DJI has really stepped up their game this thing doesn't seem so small anymore but uh let's fly it I'm headed to a safe place to fly the drone in Brooklyn away from any potential dangers because I'm a responsible non-commercial amateur drone just fa please don't give me a hard time about this I'm just trying out a new toy [Music] we're out here in Brooklyn now a nice safe place to fly and this is kind of the biggest selling point it's how easy it's supposed to fit into a backpack your body the camera right there battery and then I'm assuming it's called the snap because all right ready look it folds out and then this white module which is where the camera is and whatnot this kind of snaps in snaps battery snaps on whoa it's not bad right I was like what the hell are you gonna do with all those parts no that's it like no screws nothing and then it automatically turns on I think I couldn't find the power button but it made a noise then you trying to put it down there's no skis no feet you just like put it down there right on the battery hi nice nice to meet you a lot of friendly people here in Brooklyn she was she's doing pretty much she's struggling pre-med premed now it does have an Android in an iPhone app but I was recommended to use the iPhone app because the Android app is still in beta so there's no controller no controller okay GPS connected let's fly no way yeah but I'm not getting an image oh here we go [Music] watch that fence watch that bad Jesus how does it feel it's not holding its position very well it's a little drifting but it looks like it just caught GPS see it's staying in one spot right now okay it's way out over the water do you see it it's accelerometer based yeah are you even controlling her right now there it goes do you feel like you have any control are you trying to bring it back I still can't quite have it going up higher I don't know how to make it cutter a home but I'm trying to fly it will nothing happen side way yeah I'm I'm really struggling with the controls here and I'm doing everything it's said to do there it is Wow [Music] it landed you caught it I didn't feel like I had a whole lot of control but in in this thing's defense the first time I flew a spark with the phone the first time I used a parrot the parrot one which requires the phone basically any drone I've ever used where the control is limited to the phone I've never had any control you're trying to touch class and use an accelerometer and it's just a it's just this guy right here who we do not know is flying a Mavic the Mavic is probably the the biggest competitor to this to the snap the snaps $899 the Mavic is roughly the same price I think it's $9.99 with the controller the Mavic is in my opinion one of the greatest drones ever made so today I'm talking me through details here talking to putting your songs on a glass screen to control a thing like this is not good you want tactile buttons you want to feel what you're you're doing and this is just like the accelerometer control is very responsive if I will say and that actually works and then it's got a gimbal too which is pretty impressive stabilized gimbal but we'll have to see how that video looks it didn't look very promising from the feet on the phone now we'll go check out what the footage looks like [Music] all right so I gotta say that the footage looks fantastic I think the footage is amazing the stabilization is buttery smooth the image is at least as good as the Mavic but when it comes to drone cinematography the image quality is secondary on the list of importance after cinematography if you can't get like the perfect dynamic shots that you want what does it matter if it's a little bit smoother or the colors a little bit more rich my problem with this drone is the same problem that I had with the DJI spark before I had the controller you just cannot control a drone which is there are six axes plus the axis of the camera using a touchscreen phone but in conclusion my review of the snap drone is that it's a very very interesting device but the control and competence you have over the actual device is extremely limited now YouTube audience I don't ask you for much besides buy my new merch I do need your help to help me commit make I need your help with the Christmas miracle okay my friend Sam's 2017 goal was to get to a hundred thousand subscribers he helps me with all my videos he's a really good guy he's a really good youtuber but he's still like 18 or 22 or 32 thousand subscribers shy so I'll link in below and if maybe you could like finding your hearts to meander over to his YouTube channel and just click that subscribe button and maybe even comment like a Christmas miracle for Sam I think it would mean the worlds this guy looked he's nice and he's makes he makes the good videos and macey also these chips are really

plug the chip sir I like potato chips moonlight motor trips how about you I'm mad about good books can't get my fear", "label": "G"}, {"data": "[Music] okay that's it needle is in the arm does this hurt you as much as it hurts me Roger no Oh [Music] you [Music] [Applause] so you've seen you've seen that footage before I've talked about I've talked about in this vlog a number of times when I went to Afghanistan as a journalist I went there with my friend Scott Campbell who's this fantastic tattoo artist and he and I we linked up with these special forces guys these US Air Force pararescue jumpers and we set up a tattoo parlor in the middle of the warzone now there's one soldier in particular named Roger you've seen him on this vlog before and when we were there we tattooed Roger and he was the most kind of emotional about the process he himself when he got back he started tattooing he started giving people tattoos and he's now a pretty successful tattoo artist soldier we met in the war zone gave a tattoo to it was such an emotional experience for him that he is now a tattoo artist [Music] a lot of heat - thank you I go on the Brooklyn that's a surprise man if you have a good weekend morrow they said you promised to teach Rosa Blasi I'm going to keep you out of love Marlon you can count on me [Music] so this year this is saved tattoo this is Scott Campbell the guy that I was in Afghanistan with the tattoo artists this is his tattoo shop and he's not here but look at this guy welcome please it's good the reader you look like a tattoo artist today what is new uh oh yeah yeah Michelle did that the last night is meant for you Roger you're running out of canvas I am the chart spot [Music] the players [Music] now drive play that play yes we want to go yeah but you know just kind of treatment really do see because if you do this familiars this is Roger start that tattoo artists not Roger the soldier and what he and I are doing to sort of merging our experience together as human beings in Afghanistan and then now our strains together as artists is that fair oh yeah yeah it's very articulate I mean it's emotional for me to sit here and think about tattooing you because it wasn't for you and Scott and whatever you want to call serendipity in life I wouldn't be here doing this for you you know meeting you guys in Afghanistan like we did is what I'm hearing [Music] punishing and [Music] it's just unreal man the timing you know how things work out you know I'm not a religious guy but I feel like I'm a very spiritual guy and I've been in the military the special operations for like 20 years and just the timing and the way this is all worked out is a pretty phenomenal it [Music] it's it's really heavy stuff I mean maybe I was just at a point in my career to where needing you guys affected me the way that it did but it definitely I was open to the change in the the risk of dive and ends so in any of that long very long Rodgers tattooing me here [Music] understand what does said you were kind of talking about traditional spot for something a date/time stamp would be on the ridge I've waited that symmetrical [Music] see I've always wanted Roger to tattoo me and I've always waited to the right excuse I don't really care what the tattoo is my feeling on tattoos in general is is it's what they represent more than a sort of artistry that's why all mine are just really terrible lines it's a pretty special experience for for me I hope for him too you know what's really interesting about that sometimes you can be what are we saving ourselves for you know Roger shaving me down tattooing it was kind of awkward to shame another man but it's given us used to doll not that good or bad I mean I mean it's obviously a good thing now you just initiate my army nor shave my whole body ah we need a privacy screen I'm more than happy to shave your whole body all right on my wife beater on I'm going to go ahead and get comfortable here now the idea was for Roger to do a small tattoo on me but we just kept making it ten percent bigger and ten percent bigger and ten percent figure we're going pretty big okay that's it needle is in the arm [Music] beautifully I can't we're having a great time it's uh you know we've got to see each other over the years but I don't think anything really is intimate well I guess there are other things but this is very identified as we're gonna get and so I'm enjoying to be able to give back and do something personal for you with all the things you've done for me [Music] they could mean nothing or they can mean everything but what's really interesting is it's bringing something very intangible tangible if not just for the ritual of it but for what you're gonna be left with you know for the rest of your long we're almost done we're done rods where are we the gun stop we're on the just clean up a little bit because it's what you do what I like it I'm Casey Casey all right a little bit of Ross I like yeah I can't be here I'm gonna clean up speech and all I asked for Roger before he started the tattoo was to kind of do what he wanted to do Roger I'm wondering if you can explain to the audience what this is and what it means you know with my long military career I guess you know I've always been very drawn to samurai culture and one of the things that the samurai would adorn themselves with were paintings within samurai culture they knew they would never have this proper burial and so they wanted to kind of like celebrate the beauty of their life while being alive and so they would adorn themselves in peonies and just kind of botanicals and so this is a peony that I drew up this uh I've tattooed on people just the dearest human beings in my life it means a lot to me to be able to put it on you and I've actually got it tattooed on me this is an outline as well so just to be cool and I didn't want any shading or any color I just wanted to line yep through there thanks Roger yeah oh man yeah this is so the one request I did have from Rogers that he had to sign it he had to sign my tattoo and this is it that's the peony in the master signature and that's the peony and then that's the signature you're stuck with me forever now Roger gladly like I'm in a couple of other movies about my tattoos and how I feel about tattoos and the basic premise of those videos is that tattoos for me are about making permanent a moment or an experience in your life that's why like half of my tattoos are literally just dates or notes so I want to remember something and for the rest of my life but I see that mark on my body I want to think of that moment and this gigantic awesome samurai peony that Roger just gave me really represents like you know Rogers one of the most extraordinary human beings ever met in my entire life in the experience of knowing him the circumstances with which we met it's a delicate art of my life and who I am and that's what this is about all right Roger I want to thank you again you are a brilliant artist sir [Music]", "label": "G"}, {"data": "yeah the vlogs back [Music] [Applause] [Music] the club they get away from me and all the pretty chicks all wanna smile let me these wrapped as many all got this [Music] [Applause] [Applause] say yeah the blogs back I'm I'm very very excited about it I missed it a lot but I want to explain why the thinking behind starting this thing up again [Music] [Music] hi guys welcome it's raining out now exactly two years ago to the day 365 times to 730 days ago exactly today is March 25th 2015 was when I shot the very first episode of the vlog ever I know that it was my 34th birthday and it's also my 34th birthday today is my 36th birthday today so four days ago Monday of this week I posted a vlog episode and I need you to get on Tuesday and then Wednesday and Thursday I didn't even call them vlogs I just posted them I didn't address it in those episodes what I was doing because it was an experiment and I have to tell you it felt great and then when I think back to why I stopped like the frustration that I felt and you know what I explained right when I ended the vlog was it it had gotten like easy and what I meant by that is the creative challenge which is what I love the most I kind of faded and I spent a couple months thinking about sort of what that meant to me and I landed at a couple of places one it was like before I didn't see an end to the vlog it was just like this thing that I was doing and that I don't know it it sort of felt like treading water versus swimming like to a destination and I realized that the impetus the reason why I originally started the vlog two years ago was so I could share with an audience my company beam like what it meant to start up a company to maybe build an audience that might be excited about what I was doing and then you guys would actually use the product we were making and that worked and it was awesome and you know like the first year pretty much of the vlog so much of it was about my career beyond YouTube and that was a big driving force and as beams started to like drift away as the company started to struggle it became less and less of this show and instead this just became like this here's my day here's what I'm doing trying to and it became very routine but I've spent the last I've spent the last four months figuring out what this new company what this new project what this whole new thing is that I'm building with CNN and I wanted to announce it on the YouTube channel but it never felt right so it's not like we're doing this we're not like doing a show we're not just building an app the company still called bean but the company that we're building is much more like a lab like a laboratory where we we try different apps we build different software we make different shows we're gonna start a YouTube channel we're gonna it's a whole bunch of stuff and the more I thought about like how am I going to share with my audience what exactly I'm doing and then it was like I was like holy this is the exact same this is the exact same thought process that predicated me starting the vlog in the first place so here I am exactly two years later starting another company and all of a sudden I feel like I have a purpose to do this again and that's like wow that's crazy exciting for me that makes me feel so good you know one criticism of the vlog that I never understood was people were like Casey I feel like you're just doing the vlog so you can tell us about your company and I didn't understand that as a criticism because that is the main reason why I started the vlog and that is the reason that I'm most proud that is the aspect of the vlog that I'm most proud to share with you I love making videos I love sharing my life but I also have a really big career and something I'm super passionate about beyond YouTube and having a vlog as a way to share those other interests of mine it's a huge it's a huge source of motivation for me and then the what is that bass it's like 4:00 in the afternoon Miami I'm gonna base be that China Miami for my birthday was Candace's idea booze if there's a great idea [Music] [Music] this is for you honey thank you happy birthday okay you want to eat this okay go ahead eat the whole thing's ready hey Dad yeah I think we're just here till tomorrow but it just

"label": "G"}, {"data": "how many Poles he do for four six so you are screwed in let's not do this Candide that whole entire scene [Music] dan has been expressing a desire to get more fit and healthy so this morning he is gonna be joining me on my run not as easy as it's been doing great dude it's doing great yeah you're done yeah whoo yeah okay I'll see you good job Dan gotta start somewhere and you did what [Music] bam bam bam wha-bam wha-bam ha be a and f BAM AB imp is a bad mother and today on three six eight I'm gonna introduce you to one of the world's greatest BAM this is Paul what's up Paul tell us a little bit about yourself ah you're about to meet a man who barely survived a shark attack and is now an inspiration to all of us three years ago Paul de Gelder was with the Australian Navy part of an elite dive team on a dive to test new counterterrorism hardware and then he was suddenly attacked by a bull shark I'm Australian I opened up for Snoop Dogg in 1998 which was pretty cool wait and what capacity did you open up for Snoop Dogg I was a rapper if I YouTube searched I find a video of you rapping you can't find a video but you can find the song on iTunes what's it called pop it's smoking hydro literally took the album's ago please welcome Paul de Gelder [Music] it was the epitome of a shocky day it was early in the morning Sydney Harbour so murky water it was overcast I was on my back in a black wetsuit and black fins kicking my leg a bull shark came up from underneath me and grabbed me by the leg and the hand in the same bite decided it wanted them more than I did and started tearing me apart and took me underwater in total agony drowning me losing blood nearly dead ripped out my hamstring and took off my hand and so I had to swim back to my safety boat missing a hand and part of my leg through a pool of my own blood where my buddies were waiting to give me first day [Music] and they did that they kept me alive one of the guys had to stick his hand inside my leg and pinch closed one of the arteries and a week later I decided to have the leg removed because I couldn't feel it I couldn't move it it was gonna be useless for the rest of my life so I just thought stuff that I'll just get them to turn me into a terminator how did you swim with no arm and no leg slowly but I know we get trained to deal with very stressful situations how do they train you to deal with a situation that that was that was you know up a few tears from what I was used to but the medical training kicked in and I thought okay my hands missing I'm bleeding I've got to keep that wound above my heart so I'm swimming like that with one arm out of the water kicking one leg because I couldn't even feel the other leg and just going really slow at the same time the guys in the play are coming over towards me I didn't even think I was gonna make it I thought the shark was gonna come back it was gonna grab you by the ankle take me down and kill me so it didn't matter all I had to do was just keep trying until that happened show us your how does this work so this is called the Michelangelo it's a made in Germany it's about $19,000 for this thing I think it's the best robotic hand in the world but mostly just because I can change it from this grip to beer-drinking grip if you're gonna have a $90,000 robot arm it might as well have a beer-drinking group so the first time I met Paul was this past summer and you had on pants so I didn't see your leg yeah and he's just like a like Jack tattoo dude and I went and shook his hand ready okay but when you grab on there's like a proper squeeze there well that's still the go grip though what's fun but it's not painful but if I don't know you or you've been a bit of a dick I may just squeeze down a little bit extra and wait for the flicker in your eyes I think you just right like you have me you could do it everyone the last time the the version before this I had chillie snapped in half armwrestling unfortunately you were armwrestling with a prosthetic hand like that with a girl there may have been some product oral damage there was some cracks in it because I'm pretty hard on this I'm about as hard on my prosthetics as you are on everything so I lost the hand and the leg if I was gonna lose just one it would not be a hand take the leg take the leg you can replace a leg so I've got a running blade I've got a swimming leg I've got a diving leg I've got this amazing $200,000 leg but you cannot replace a hand not yet there's no Luke Skywalker hand out yet and what allows you to get back in the water three months later what is it from inside of you that lets you do that it's a deep love for being in the water for me I don't think you can get any closer to being an actual part of nature than being completely submerged in the ocean it's relaxing it alleviates stresses and fears and you feel relaxed and it can wash away a lot of the stresses that are impacted on you throughout your life have you met Arnold Schwarzenegger yeah yeah I know him huge knowledge to you that you're closer to the Terminator than he ever is not quite [Music] [Music] water why one fall on a good life what do I want a bad love and a good life is gonna win every time I I was always that there was two things I was afraid of in life sharks and public speaking now I make shock documentaries to Shark Week and I'm a public speaker so you never know what life has in store for you you just get like literally your biggest weaknesses can become your biggest strengths if you just face them head-on all this amazing stuff came out of the worst thing that has ever happened to me in my life [Music] [Music] look this is this is the new 368 mascot but this clickbait sooo good we're going to save this for another episode how many pull-ups he do for how many pull-ups can you do Aaron fine really so Paul we're gonna have Dan do a contest first Aaron and then you and I are gonna head your head is that sound good okay so what was the count let's not do this and eat that whole entire seed okay so that's this weather the shark took it off from but this is what we were discussing before why I have problems with the camera because I can't hold it with my right hand that's what you have to do yeah that can pass and then you like you when you're moving your arm you're fucking with the zoom and the you can't grip it there's no way to hold mine camera company it's figure this out what do I do and this is what I use if anyone tries to mess with me as well one two man no not even slowing down eighteen nineties yes effects okay it's good these three James describes one two ten eleven are you you nearly halfway [Music] good luck with the new goals of facing up against whoa I'm gonna try I'm never gonna reach 30 pull-up level but I'm going to try fire and good to see you bye guys okay that's one badass motherfucker indeed [Music] you", "label": "#"}, {"data": "I think two days ago or three days ago I posted my like initial like first look review of the new little spark throne this is gonna be like a reoccurring theme in the blog because this is after spending three additional days of it since the review I still stand by it as like an incredible incredible piece of hardware and I still like I don't have a controller for it I'm still using my old iPhone there isn't even an Android app for me to use my galaxy with it that limits it on top of that I'm using beta software that limits it I only have one battery and despite all those shortcomings it's still amazing last thing I'll say about it so to start my day this thing is pretty tough I don't have any extra propellers or anything so I'm trying to be careful with it not break it but I did crash it into a tree at full speed [Music] and it was windy out there too and it handled the wind like there was no problem you know because my drones are so big and they take up so much space and they're such a liability I've been much more cautious with the where and the when of using them in the vlog that's why there's been a lot less drone footage unless I'm in a place that's like big and open but this is going to let me shoot in places I've never shot before [Music] [Music] [Music] I mean in the history of ever could could you imagine a drone that I can fly out of my studio door down the hallway say hi to my friends and fly it back into the studio aren't the most boring there was boring thing the least interesting thing I've ever done in the history of the blog was was when I brought the vlogging camera and you the audience with me on jury duty that was pretty boring today's goal is to break the vlogging record for most boring thing ever vlog that's your cue to stop watching right now so yeah boring I have to go to the Department of Motor Vehicles in New York City to change the address on my driver's license like which is not going to be exciting this is not going to be fun I appreciate it if you're still watching at this point [Music] hey what's up guys three I thought that perfect alright well that was a miserable failure not like a update it's a transfer and without the right I failed I do not have a new drivers life I hate the DMV I hate the DMV very true story I was so upset like frazzled and frustrated because of the DMV situation I was like kid I'm not shooting a video today I'm not shooting a vlog today and that's it I didn't show anything else to Dan I was out with Candace and she had this funny idea and she said shoot and it kind of felt like that was enough to call this an episode we're funny getting [Music] you're gonna pick lemon all right I'm gonna go with blue raspberry this this was Candace's idea the first time we've done one of these on the channel this is a sour what do you call this in it this is a mega sour warhead eating contest they used to be called mega sour warheads when I was a child now I don't really like sour stuff especially these it is more like on the chemically side for me I'm not really into the typical content no no honey I don't wanna do it it's how long keys where your mouth without my custody how often you know so now I'm making it okay I didn't really know the rules I thought we were seeing you scrub your mouth watering we both have to look at the camera 1 2 3 good oh all right I said before I don't love sour for a sweet guy

backing exactly where I started [Music]", "label": "G"}, {"data": "I think I see a girl walking a pig [Music] [Music] situation it's like a huge deal Bert is sort of a big deal it we have a situation [Music] quick eight miles I gotta go deal with the situation you see the video I put out like two days ago about the flooding in Houston and hurricane Harvey the one that had Candace's dad my father-in-law in it that's super important context super important context because in that video you see Candace my wife her dad Stanley explained how he was trapped in his house in Texas during the floods he had to climb through the roof and he shows his leg and it's all bruised he literally lost his home due to a flood it's been kind of a rough week for Stanley all right so here's the situation Stanley turned 70 it's his 70th birthday this week now all the same wanted for his birthday was to go on a family trip with his with his daughters and his two grandchildren the trip has been planned for the better part of the last nine months and the trip the family trip this is his idea is to go on a cruise a cruise ship a cruise boat that's a Disney cruise boat you know like Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck and all that and that cruises you to leave in two days from Florida all right category five hurricane winds still 185 miles an hour on top of that Francine's been so excited and we bought her all the stuffed animals and shoes and flip-flops and all that stuff just for this trip that's now maybe going to be canceled so the vlogs of this week are gonna be entirely dedicated to whether or not we go on that trip [Music] remember my sunglasses that had the purple lenses these ones those glasses well I lost them swimming in the ocean at my friend's birthday party I really missed them so I ordered another pair off of Amazon they came this week but I think they're counterfeit here's where things get fishy the texture of these does not feel right on top of that they feel a little too flexible and this shade of purple seems a little darker than how I remember it so what I don't think these counterfeiters realize is that they're selling these glasses to someone who literally lives in a pair of Raven glasses and I can tell when they feel different and these feel different I don't think they're legit now I did weigh them against my other glasses and they check out exactly 35 grams and when I check all the details like the Markel's they're the etching into the the logo on the side and even the text on the inside of the arm that that all checks out but I I can't place it they just don't feel right also the receipt that came with it said if there's any problem with this package don't contact Amazon contact us directly it seemed a little Shady fashion shoot behind me here this is the official raven's Soho flagship store I'm hoping I can get to the bottom of this suspected counterfeit inside the store here this is not an advertisement for a band at all in fact I'm not a fan of Ray Ban the brand that's why I scratch their labels off of all my sunglasses but they are the ones who make these glasses so it always seems appropriate what's up man my name is Dmytro dot no limit on that I'll just go man's on 150 Instagram cat under school camisa you can count on me gentlemen you can count on me no purple okay I've got a question for it I bought these on the internet I think they're bullsh I think that these are counterfeits I think they're really good counterfeits but I think they're counterfeit I did that look good we go by the fonts on the inside so one thing I'm so sorry we can't do like all right so they're convinced these glasses are legit but they didn't do a very thorough inspection and honestly I still think they're bogus so this segment the counterfeit glass segment will happy to be continued I need to find a real expert on Raven it's the new videomic pro from road they used to only use this microphone but I got frustrated with her or something I stopped usually this is the new one they're supposed to fix all the short company okay ready tell me if this sounds any different you're now listening to the old mic and you're now listening to the new mic how does it sound better more clear this is what the old mic look like this is also rode mic I like this microphone I like the shock mount look I broke it and had to tape it but I do like this doesn't take any batteries expect a full comprehend [Music] are we or are we not going on the 70th birthday family vacation that this week but have they said if our cruise ships canceled which is really step like what if people need to get medications for more than five days honey and you do best assessment are these counterfeit yes I they're kind of tight um to the store and they said they're not counterfeit they just look really cheap right so what's the verdict fake okay all right well thank you so much for letting us know so we just wait to hear from the travel agent or what happened Disney Cruise canceled no so I do just want to say since since I recorded this vlog episode it's like two days ago that hurricane hurricane Irma has has hit land on a couple of islands in Puerto Rico and it looks like it's headed for Florida and it is proven to be like an absolutely devastating devastating storm so my stupid vacation to go see Mickey Mouse doesn't really matter but lots of thoughts and and really just best wishes for anyone and everyone who's in the trajectory of this storm and is being affected by this like deadly truly terrifying storm", "label":

the episode I'm at an airplane right now watching watching hillary clinton's concession speech truck one i just wanted to address that everybody on Twitter is like what do you think what are you gonna do first of all I know a lot of my viewers are Trump supporters so congratulations I entirely respect the outcome of the elections Trump won fair and square and and I think the key thing to remember whether you agree with him or disagree with him is that the beauty and the most incredible part again to live in this to well live in that country live in this country is that no one person whether it's a politician anybody else can really control how you live your life so if you disagree with our new president-elect then then it's up to you to stand up for your values and what you believe all

not the three of us", "label": "G"}, {"data": "this is going to be a comprehensive review of this $1500 electric skateboard versus this four hundred and forty nine dollar skateboard let's begin by comparing Hardware before I go outside for some practical tests of these boards I just want to go over some of the technical specifications looking at their websites they're super super similar so the two sport says it goes 20 miles an hour boosted board says it goes 22 miles an hour this thing says has a seven mile range boosted says it has a six or seven mile range regenerative braking dual motors regenerative braking dual motors honestly even the juice website looks like the boosted board website but for like a side-by-side spec analysis they seem to be very or lease advertised as very very similar I did want to do a flex test [Music] all right this is the Flex test on the $1500 boosted board 100% bamboo deck look at that flex flex and this is the Flex Omni um it's actually for 49 is for the cheap one 599's for the dual motor version of the juice so I take that but I said this is a five hundred and $99 board not at $499 board all right this is the Flex test on the bamboo and maple juice board exactly not that bad and you can't flex as much that hits this battery and it's it does feel more rigid but it flexes a lot more than I had expected it to so what Sam go outside now right yell to it okay let's joy I'm gonna have Sam carry the extra board because well he offered to and you're cool that alright yeah it's alright if you're wondering why we're carrying the juice board it's cause like I want to ride it for the first time on camera and in New York City we got to make sure we're somewhere we can like ride safely where there's not too many people we're going to carry it to a safe less crowded part of the city test it there all right so now we're deep deep on Manhattan's West Side there's like some thuggish looking dudes over there that are smoking pot I'm not going to film them they look a little scary over here we've got the ups fulfillment center this is a good place to test the board that is a guy's smoking pot all right this is it this is the first powering up of the juice board great turn on fine no problem all right well I'll tell you this much it's a lot quieter than the boosted board start off with the speed test yeah acceleration test yeah a very important detail here NYPD this is chalk and washes away with water this is not vandalism because it's temporary please don't show up to my house or office and we're trying to arrest me again okay that's going to be our starting line there [Music] I'm on the juice board that's the boosted board ready yep one two three okay well this is the initial ride of the juice board and acceleration not great [Music] would that look like in your perspective I didn't even see it you were gone in half a second all right next test is going to be the high speed to the top speed test how do we even do this I'm gonna go as fast as I can say I'm gonna try and keep up now I'm on the juice board I'm on the cheap board the $449 board so that's been 10 seconds this is probably top speed come on man when it comes to top speed test again the juice board was absolutely creamed by the boosted board now this next test this is going to be the braking test how quickly they stopped my chalk line which is right here which is washable chalk not vandalism remember that it's not vandalism this chalk line right here we're going to start all the way down there at that truck come full speed to the line here and then hit the brakes as soon as we hit this line and see how far past the line we go before we stop three two go all right so we did that test five times and quite frankly the brakes on this aren't that bad like Busan weren't definitely stopped so windy stop more aggressively and more effectively but it's not like the acceleration test like I would say that stops in about 15 feet of less distance than this stops kind of amazing this kid just came up on a Busan word yeah what's your name Casey how long have you been riding your booster board I had it since day one try out this juice board just like take it up and down the street let me know your honest thoughts compared to the boosted board all right cool all right so this is the unbiased stranger we met in the street who's a veteran boosted board rider test I think that like what's the rest what about the booster for you can go on reverse this you can't really do that anything like getting on like those little edges when you're turning the boost is just like super smooth like this I feel like I kind of like out of it I drift a little bit the verdict here is that I would say that screw support is better but I would say it I'm bad for you don't think it's bad okay thank you for your help nice to meet you and you sir I promised him I'd buy him the smoothie help me with this video fair trade all right so the conclusion from the tests in the real world is that it's not as bad as I expected but it's nowhere near as good as this but for 500 bucks you're getting a pretty good for this isn't garbage it's not garbage I would not call it pretty good though in conclusion this thing works it's fine I guess it is impressive that they're able to do it for such a low price but just know one thing this is not a boosted board this is a cheap knockoff of a boosted board this this is a toy and if you're fine buying a toy then it's a good value for a toy but it's a little bit like wanting a high-performance sports car like wanting a Ferrari boosted board being the Ferrari instead of getting a Ferrari you get a used old Hyundai used old Hyundai's fine I might even get you from A to B but if you want a hybrid if you want a Ferrari don't buy a Hyundai and then paint a dramatically similar logo to the Ferrari on this side and expect that cheap knockoff to perform like a Ferrari also I crashed my new spark drone

nice work DJ I [Music]", "label": "#"}, {"data": "nice work that's both right there you got this honey how did you do that this has to be some sort of gender record mind over matter all right babe [Music] [Applause] that's how my long naps it's been real [Music] Oh summer is nearing its unwelcomed end and for those of you who know me at all you know that I get severely depressed and turned into a total freakout monster at the end of the summer on top of that Candis is getting more pregnant every minute of every day and her ability to move is dwindling so we decided this past weekend that we would go out to the beach shoe today is Friday and we are taking a little family trip to the beach for one day we come back tomorrow Francine are you excited what are you most excited about Candice is getting snacks right now what's taking Bobby so long she doesn't know we'll have to see we are about two hours into the drive I'm no longer allowed to drive because I'm a terrible driver so I'm in the back of the kid how much further franciene what's that thing called no a windmill look there's the ocean we're at the beach hey we made it is the hotel we're staying at we leave tomorrow is kind of a lot of driving for one night that's okay Francine and Candice hurry up there I carry this stuff I'm not on the dad [Music] yeah that's four days almost over but I'm gonna go for a little swim in the pool before the Sun sets I know this is shaping up to be a great vlog it but well we woke up the next morning [Applause] Beach tripping our raindrip the rain never stopped ended up just being mommy daddy and Frannie hanging around in a hotel room for 24 hours it was lovely but I thought I would use this opportunity of having a failed episode to share with you a kind of a story okay this is it if 4.8 more and I got it wait 4.7 more and I got it so believe it or not I love to run and I don't know I've been what's why I get these sort of freak outs I'm getting so old I'm 37 I start to feel like an old man I don't know it probably is irrational but I wanted to challenge myself to see what I was like see what I was capable of to see where I far I could push my body because it's just gross out and my shoes are wet but for miles nobody I'll sleep through this and I think unless you test yourself you don't really know what you're capable of so you know I run a lot I run like 40 50 60 miles a week which is a lot of miles in a week and I wanted to give myself a real challenge so a marathon is 26.2 miles so three marathons would be 70 what is 26.2 times three so three marathons is seventy eight point six miles so I thought why not try to do in seven days from Sunday until Saturday in seven days try to run the equivalent of four marathons that is 104 point eight miles in order to do this it means running about 15 miles a day which is a lot this is kind of tough it's late we're on vacation this weekend it's like 10:00 at night the kid just went to sleep now 2:13 this morning but if I want to get across that threshold I gotta get in at least five more right now which means that when we have to do 14 more tomorrow no 19 more tomorrow got to do it it was I think the hardest part of giving yourself such a stupid challenge was finding the time see I saw the kid and the pregnant wife at home I still have a job I still I still uploaded five videos last I had to figure out how to run a hundred and five miles in addition to living my normal life and it was a lot to do these late-night miles are so tough everybody's like out partying exhausted it's 10:45 now I'm glad I'm clocking miles I'm like stacking chips right now those miles are just piling on you know I'm 37 years old and like this leg here this is all made from titanium because of a motorbike accident like 10 years ago and I'm not supposed to be running and I don't stretch and look oh I can't even touch my toes I've broken half the bones in my body I've got a lot of problems but for whatever reason I have like a broken chromosome where I can just run I never got tired my legs never got tired my lungs never got tired my stomach never got tired the only thing that would happen every single day is that run out of time Candice would be caller I have to get to work or a meeting or something like that that was hugely positive you like driving old car cause it's 37 years old and then you like hit the gas and it just goes for us you're like my car still works my car's still worse [Music] no rain pouring right right now rain is not an excuse you know run right through it okay 104 point eight miles got it my wife made fun of me she called me a sociopath maybe a psychopath I don't remember very well Franny all right kids this is it four more miles and I will have done it it's almost like carrying a child to be their birth so proud of you I'm really glad I did it and I think that in weather something silly like how far can you run or anything else in life it was a reminder for me of the importance of challenging yourself you know challenging yourself doesn't always have to be climbing a mountain or running around the world they're doing something wild and ambitious but for me it was just about putting out my sneakers and getting out there and seeing what I was capable of physically and for that I think my biggest takeaway was just a greater appreciation of the fact that I am extremely lucky to be 37 and have a body that's capable that lets me do what I want to do where I can still do these kinds of things it makes me want to eat better and don't eat better and sleep more I still don't sleep that much and just be more responsible with my body because it's something that I hope to never lose [Music] all right that's like five and a half miles I think that puts me at a hundred and five point one or something for the week which means victory is mine I did it four marathons seven days 105 plus miles all right that's it I did it 105 miles I want to end this by saying I want to say this publicly I want to say this on the record I want you to hold me accountable for this my next self-imposed completely unnecessary challenge is going to be to run seven marathons in seven days that's like 160 miles in seven days but a marathon a day for a week I want to do that sometime next couple years hold me to it we're going home tonight but we came all the way to the beach to go to the beach rain or shine we're going to be ready [Music] ah all right I'll see you tomorrow after my ride [Music] you", "label": "G"}, {"data": "what the hell's going on here how exactly does

is in journalism and public relations a present Bargo is a request by a source that the news provided is not published until a certain date you know something but you can't talk about it okay in this box is this totally in this box is something totally new it's a drone and it's the it's the latest and greatest you supposed to put in your pocket got a 4k camera I'm not allowed to talk about it we're open that but well I guess I could open the box i couldn't show you until october $YEAR 18 so far this press embargo sucks in other news my airplane seat movie it's about to cross 20 million views 20 million that's insane nobody has been up for seven days 20 million views in seven days that's like five million views a day I know it's not final but that also means which is not is that is now the second most watched movie of all the 650 videos or whatever on my youtube channel so i want to take one second and talk about viral videos so i have touched on this before in this channel but it's a popular subject especially relevant since I just had like a wild viral video viral videos viral videos are almost impossible to predict their greens about the shot watch already watched sumo green writing the eyeball boom dad viral videos are almost impossible to manufacture to actually create now the flip side of that is that nothing can do for a youtube channel what a viral video can do for youtube channel bike lanes which was like my first really viral video on this channel it blew my channel up in the seven days in several East this 20 million view banger i've got almost a half a million new subscribers viral videos are hugely powerful and that's why people are is pursuing them all right why did this one go viral pouring it into this and say this is why I think this particular video went viral not a recipe for viral videos in general abroad abbreviated examination of y21 thousand-dollar first-class airplane seat went viral number-one zeitgeist right now like this idea of opulence and indulgence and over-the-top miss creates a climate where a title that says 21 thousand-dollar airplane seat that's interesting . compelling what kind of a world we live in where a one-way airplane seat cost twice as much as the worldwide median household income timing there's a lot of bad news right now there's this us election which is a mess there's the conflicts taking place in the Middle East in Syria there's global terrorism there's Isis there's all these just terrible things dominating the news cycle and when something fun and harmless and playful and interesting and sort of newsworthy pops up everybody just jumped on it general this is something like a fancy airplane t the whole world is interested in this was written about in south korea and easy and in and in New Zealand it was written about in Canada it was written about in Saudi Arabia this stupid story about the airplane seat was general and up to appeal to most of the world which is a nice segue into the last factor in oculus it was perfectly innocuous there was nothing offensive or harmful or bad about that video at all which when it was safe for all the press outlets and soccer moms that posted on Facebook and shared over there no swear words there's nothing gross there's nothing yucky there is nothing offensive about that too anyone when you combine all those factors would like a little bit of funny and interesting well-told story and then a lot of bit of luck that's how that viral video came to be yeah what about her feel good being pregnant if you doing the whole foods now groceries are expensive tonight here in the united states of america is the first-ever presidential election no first-ever what would i say first-ever first to me is the first presidential debate where they have the Republican nominee in the Democratic nominee and then they battle to the death we are having a debate party at our house although it's not much of a party because we only invited five friends one

importantly", "label": "#"}, {"data": "okay people keep asking what's up with my CNN thing so I thought I'd make a quick video explaining what's up with my CNN thing I want to start with a little bit of historical context you know to shape the story out all right the CNN thing this is a brief history so in early 2015 I founded a technology company called beam with Matt Hackett he was my partner then at the end of March that year I launched the vlog the purpose of the vlog initially was just to talk about me starting a new company and then it spiraled into something bigger and then summer 2015 mid-june we publicly launched being the app a video sharing app like snapchat or Instagram or something like that and largely driven by the popularity of the vlog and I think people liked the idea of being downloads skyrocketed the app did really really well through summer and then slowly falling following and not recovering we had a good app we had a great idea but snapchat was better and Instagram was a better idea we got our asses kicked then some summer 2016 not now we're trying to figure out the future of the company was CNN bought bean now a lot of people ask why would CNN buy a failed video sharing app well they didn't buy the app they bought the technology company that was behind that app there's a tremendous amount of value in putting together a team and building a company in the infrastructure and the IP that we create there's a lot of value behind that one app and that's what CNN was interested in there are also interested in me because of what I'd done on the blog now one very important distinction I've said this before but a very important distinction CNN did not buy and does not own in any capacity this YouTube channel my youtube channel that was not part of the deal I'll always continue to post wherever the hell I want to post on this channel beam CNN separate entities and that's the history portion of this video what's beam up to now so we that is me and Matt and our new partners from CNN spent the first part of this year kind of defining what it is we wanted to do and we knew we wanted to continue in technology we knew we wanted to introduce more media that is like videos and movies and YouTube and and want to build something completely new the old beam that app that we killed has nothing to do with the new company but we still have the same people the same team we've actually been hiring quite a bit our team now is well it's you [Music] and something that's super important understand is that CNN owns being but we operate separately so CNN's in this gigantic glass tower in Midtown and we work out of an old fucked up former furniture store in Chinatown CNN has like a gazillion employees and they wear suits and stuff like that we we work in a basement in Chinatown so we really do operate on our own and that's not to say if we start screwing up that's and I might not step in but so far we still run this company like a startup we want to make all kinds of shows all kinds of content we want to release a lot of it here on YouTube but we're also not against like trying other platforms newer platforms but we're starting here on YouTube just parenthetically we haven't launched the YouTube channel yet I'll let you know but there's no we're not up yet the first show we want to launch we're calling beam news and we want it to be like it'll probably four days a week when we launched it we want to get it to seven days a week I'm going to host it a little bit and then we're going to other people host it it has to be bigger than me to succeed and I don't want to be the k/t show we got like a really smart team of journalists and researchers and writers helping us make that show we'll never be like a regular journalist hosting it'll be probably somebody like me or a youtuber like Jake Jake we've met before Jake is our head of production it's a nice sounding title but I'm alone and I feel Head of Production alone and he's like really leading the charge on the media stuff including the Daily Show now editorial I know there's a lot of questions behind editorial editorial meaning like you know what are our political leanings and what can be the content of the show the show is not going to be a politically motivated show we're not going to be trying to convince anyone to do anything in this show politically in fact politics will make up at most a tiny tiny piece of this show and that's challenging we're fighting against the baggage that comes with CNN a lot of people like CNN for certain reason people hate CNN for certain reasons and then we have to sort of push back into my own baggage I will be voting for Hillary yes that was a little heavy-handed I realize that you know let me take a second and explain my own political position and again my politics will have a little role in this show in my hosting of it as humanly possible but it is important for me to share with you where I stand politically so well you can watch the content through that lens now besides like a lot of folks on reddit and whoever else labeling me like a snowflake a liberal snowflake Lib tard I think is the title actually I personally identify with a lot of conservative values identify with some liberal values and a lot of libertarian values I'm scattered and I certainly don't subscribe to any one political label I do subscribe to a set of morals and a set of principles and when I look to politician to a like who I don't like I typically like the ones that are rooted in principle in values more so than a political party or affiliations or things like that I know it's very heavy-handed in the last presidential campaign but look I hated the 2016 presidential campaign we had two candidates neither of which I liked one of which I dislike more than the other one that I dislike I don't love what's around in Washington that's both sides of the aisle I have huge issues with politics in the United States of America as a whole and that's where I stand politically I don't even know if that's appropriate for to be in this video but I think there's a lot of misconceptions about Who I am and where I stand politically so I wanted to share that with you themed news will not be politically focused politics are only gonna play a tiny if any role in that show itself instead it's a daily news show about the things that interests us that is the team that's making it and where we are the show now actually we are producing it we're making a show right now and we make something we look at it internally and we're like what sucks about this and we try to correct that and right now I say this show is good we want to get it to very good and when it's very good we're going to launch it publicly and then someday we want to make it great very good is good enough to put it out there and then we want to hear back from people and and ultimately together make it great and that when I think of like my blog I think the first episodes tend to suck but [Music] like look beam identity design so that's this isn't final but like that's what we're thinking for fonts and like being news beam tales being Doc's being productions like the different things that we're going to do under beam and those are like slightly different fonts this was an earlier version of the logo this logo I liked but and then we landed on this I don't think that this is finalized either but this is the idea I hope you think that's cool I'm very very excited about that design I think it feels fresh and smart and also like a little bit nostalgic like kind of weirdo 1980s local news but in all the right ways this is give me the first time anyone look how thin I am this is the first time anyone's seen any of beam news actual beam news this is just a test this is not for publishing on being music what I need to know okay when Costa spit not me the I hosted it Casey is very tan I did look at the screen we try to talk about we found this interesting story that we liked about click farms and that's basically the thing that instigates the whole entire piece is click farms how easy it is to get clicks but this is a good this is it sort of teaser to show you a little bit of like the things that we are interested by we I mean the whole team is interested in it's not politics it's not the news that your parents watch or whatever this is like but it is news news but it's more of an experience I think is what we're trying to go for hey now no ok here comes the first-ever case of a little bit of a beam news might this is something that I found to be particularly interesting happened on Monday and that is that police and Thailand raided a clique farm and we've heard about put farms before especially on platforms like YouTube but in case you haven't they are places that sell social media likes follows and views to companies or individuals who want to boost their online popularity that could farm in Thailand like other click farms in India Bangladesh and elsewhere have these janky looking racks filled with hundreds of cell phone workers then rotate hundreds of thousands of SIM cards through these phones to make a look different users were liking or viewing or friending or whatever it is that people do now let's be clear to me this is a form of cheating and a lot of platforms and online stores prohibit stuff like this in their Terms of Service and they might even kick you off their site or delete your fake followers and views and likes reviews if you do business with a click farmer other fake users but also legal the three guys who were arrested in that Thailand raid weren't arrested for running a clip farm according to the AP they were actually arrested on charges that included not paying taxes on those hundreds of cell phones and we wanted to figure out just how easy this is spoiler alert it's actually pretty easy for example there are vending machines in Russia where you can buy Instagram likes as if they were skittle so all this gave us an idea to try two things one let's actually buy some fake Instagram followers and two what if we did it for one of the people working upstairs at the beam office and then we just didn't tell them about it hey Jack so who should we buy some Instagram collars for Steve all right so it's pretty easy we found this website and we have some few options for how many followers we should get what do you think we should go with one hundred timeout I like that it's quality followers yeah the best only the best well that's for Steve all right we can do $39.99 because we have pnn money oh there's Wow yes that is we have a plane while I do this you go upstairs and see if we can capture the moment when it happening yes all right you can walk up and try and not have speed see me doing this but it's going to be kind of obvious I think what's up man yeah well you were firing partner Joey strike a pose okay there were pain now see what happened okay did we paid 300 for the camera hey Rick Rick for the kid very aware that I want to tape if you're Mike Patton in five minutes so read that as well Justin just in case picked up to 265 lead I had to like in the comments now let's just refresh this thing and see when it takes place and this works I'm going to freak out yes it's happening that's 53 lights right now 77 like 86,000 905 951 I feel really bad notification you're kind of blowing up right on IG what did you do why do I have 2000 like Sonic 3 what not somewhere in there almost 200 times more people taking my photos than regular now we're going to talk a little bit philosophically this isn't the news anymore but what I find especially from living in social media I mean my career was made off of social media is that it's an extension of our selves to a degree it's allowing us to share these moments of our lives with others and we want people to appreciate them is that in the form of a like or view probably yes and so there is some meaningfulness to that all right that is the new I'm Jake this was being new and remember to smash that like button because it's the only thing that makes me feel valuable or important in this life and hagas why follow me on Instagram Twitter Facebook snapchat I would say beam I'm head apps dead All Right see you later is it 3,000 likes now wow that's awful did you go to song or simple I'm in first I really can't deal with having to clean that up okay yeah okay are you gonna be that pilot it is possible we hope to launch that show soon ish like you know weeks maybe a month something like that like I said we're making it now this is not ready yet the second show that I'm anxious to do is an investigative reporting show like a once a week show where we like dive really deep into one issue and pull that apart and after that like I'd love to do something that sports focused maybe would live I'd love to do something that is music or fashion focus that's more cultural but that's the scope of the ambition on the media side like it's it's this is not talking head news we want to really broaden our scope in what we're doing and we want all the content to be very like YouTube centric so I hope that helps give you a better understanding of what we're doing what I've been focusing a lot of my time on and and maybe even gets you a little bit there's the Sun it's like impossible that even lighting me and I will of course say this like I think a lot of people have concerns that CNN the company might be heavy-handed in what we're doing I think a lot of people have concerns that what we're doing is going to be like crazy liberal bullshit I think people have concerns that like it's not going to be me and when I don't understand something I am immediately skeptical of it so I would expect that of you about this new thing that I haven't done a good job explaining yet but I say this whether you are suspect of CNN suspect of news or a new thing or whatever here's my ass just check it out when we launch if you think it's shit call us out and tell us why it's shit if you think it's really shit just never watch it again but if you like it like let us know let me know and let us know why and that's the that's the very best I can do if it is garbage and you don't like it totally cool unsubscribe never watch it again stop watching me but I think that we are doing something interesting and something new we got awesome people working on it and I hope that we're able to turn something out that you're pumped for okay beam

elk this could feed her back for several days unlike the pop of wolf and I raised my tub or my wolf puppy and he gets bigger and stronger I teach it I teach it how to fight and I teach it how to forage and how to eat and how to survive but eventually have to set that little puppy at the inexperienced youngsters wait too dark for smooth free to go out into the world and hopefully make it a

the festival which is always my favorite part Jr no yeah I offered him a ride on the boosted board [Music] you do something incredible here officer Yatta Yatta Roscoe you got it faster you just need to go faster okay you almost have an old school move there's an old school skateboarding move that you can do even if you're not a good skateboarder if you just kind of jump and if there's like a hanging piece of chain or one of these you jump over the thing and you land back on your board and I said oh great I can this is a rare opportunity to try that move and then I looked at it was a little higher than I thought I mean it's too high to jump you can do it I can get a skateboard so this is just a break in between film screenings in the fear of that we've been exploring this campus it's a veteran's home the largest veterans home in the United States so one of the veterans told me an Oscar and I have been skating around and we've like been meeting veterans and I met a really nice guy who was super super psyched about my drone told me a story about flying a drone in home hitting the ceiling then it landing on him and you met a guy named Ralphie boy Ralphie boy whoo I think I was trying to connect with by talking about how my father grew up in a military background and then I think he was like oh wait this guy's a hardcore military dude because he said he could never have fought even though he served so there was a nice way of connecting with different people yeah great though just great like I think we want to try it again [Music] [Music] [Music] I never doubted you

Sonia despite the increase in the cloud cover over the past couple of hours temperatures have remained on the warm side still in the lower 70s we had a few more than that up to 76 October 23rd 2017 and it's 76 degrees outside average weather for this the average temperature for October 23rd is 50 degrees it is 26 degrees above normal today I need an excuse to be outside for today's video [Music] all these packages right here these are mail time packages no I I genuinely thought when I announced has me selling my extra mail time stuff that people would stop sending email time stuff but more just keeps coming if you don't know what I'm talking about a few months ago I said I was gonna take all the mail time stuff that I don't personally use and sell it on eBay so far we've been able to sell almost thirty five thousand dollars worth of stuff and all that money is gonna go help the people affected by the hurricane who live in Puerto Rico we're distributing it with a couple of different nonprofits down there but good work folks but one thing that came in that really stood out that I've wanted to make a video about is this tiny electronic skateboard called quick wheel I think it's called quick wheel now if you've ever seen this channel before all rightie of my videos you know that I am the world's biggest boosted board fan I own six of these things I ride it literally every day of my entire life and this electric skateboard the boosted board has literally changed the way I interact with this entire city I don't ride a bike I don't take the subway the only way I really get around is on this thing yeah I love the board it's the greatest thing ever but I have one gigantic persistent complained about the boosted board and that is the price it is cost prohibitive for most people so addition to like me how tiny this thing is it's also need 200 bucks which matter of disclosure I wasn't hired I'm not being paid by quick wheel to review this thing initial sort of build quality on this it feels like like a regular proper skateboard see this is like it's what a regular board decks made out of wheels feel nice and gummy bearings I don't know they seem fine it looks like the motor is housed inside of the wheel here and I think there's just one motor just in this wheel alright now for the real world test I recruited my friend Sam helmet runner kids when driving electric skateboard of any kind safety matters so we're gonna go to the west side works like a safe place to tap these things what is interesting though is my ability to carry this skateboard while riding my big skateboard [Music] so just to show off the sides before we actually test this this is your regular penny board here look it it's smaller than a regular sized penny board this is your regular sized backpack almost sort of fits right in the back it spins ready silent [Music] [Music] it's much harder to balance on the Naboo support you look so goofy right it's like a toy I mean I have to say the responsiveness is pretty good like the speed top that do not have the confidence on this that you do on a boost at work already this is the breakdown 3 2 1 break there's not much for breaks alright dude do I have to [Music] [Music] baby [Music] you look great [Music] so I guess the question is is this a toy or is this like an actual means of transportation it's it's a toy I think this is a toy but airports airports travel what else is this useful for if you have a huge house a good way to get around your home yeah I mean at 200 bucks it's not a bad Toyota play with like I don't have many bad things to say about this it's really small and as someone who's been skateboarding for a while there's really not much room to put your feet so one thing that is interesting it's both the size and the Flex of the boosted board that lets you come over bumps and if you hit little potholes or cracks it can handle it so this board has neither size nor flex so when you hit a bump you really feel it most of the take offs not much alright so epic conclusion here it's a cool device I think they're only 200 bucks which is a great price but I don't think that feels safe the way that a boosted board does I think boosted's the only electric skateboard I've ever ridden that actually feels safe to ride if you're a parent thing you get it for your kids then you live on a cul-de-sac and it's a flat ground yeah maybe maybe a fun toy if you're thinking about this for any form of viable transportation even if you live on a college campus I give it a no the same it's it's dangerous it's dangerous but it is fun and 200 bucks is an insane price [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] only electric skateboard that weighs less than three kilograms you know one day I do have a quick question about when it comes to this skateboard on their IndieGoGo page it looks like like a crowdsource thing the company quick wheel it says in San Francisco but the voiceovers like this weird word is made of computerized voice and then there's like two very American looking bros who star in the video but it's filmed in China I have nothing against products made in China just if it's a Chinese company own that it's a Chinese company and don't front like it's a San Francisco startup this is a robot word why does it seem like they're posing as a Bay Area look that's China yeah yeah that's bizarre weird right [Music] [Laughter] [Music]", "label": "G"}, {"data": "I made this video last week basic thesis of the videos that youtube doesn't do enough to support their community that is creators in the platform I didn't release it so that I was too harsh a critique and then this morning I look at my I look at the creator app here and I saw that this travel vlog which is the most innocuous vlog ever it's literally me going to Indonesia to sit down with the president of Indonesia was demonetized so here's my kind of long and boring but critical commentary on YouTube and how they should do a better job looking after their community last week there's a gigantic controversy here on YouTube a controversy that I found myself just accidentally at the very heart of it had to do with D monetization and hypocrisy and unfair treatment of one channel over another on YouTube and in the end I think YouTube might actually be changing policy because of the uproar if you don't know what I'm talking about I will link Phil DeFranco his video on the subject below Phil does an absolutely fantastic job of explaining the circumstances around that controversy controversy is coming Joe there's always me something people are upset about when you have as big of a user base as YouTube has what caught me I froze just how upset a huge swath of the YouTube community was at YouTube and and not just because of this controversy this controversy just proved to be sort of a catalyst for a lot of the community to speak up about what upsets them about YouTube I genuinely don't feel YouTube does enough to take care of and look after their community now before I unpacked that let me just say I'm a huge fan of YouTube I am so much of my career to YouTube I traveled the world evangelizing YouTube I want this platform to succeed also I personally know much of the leadership team the executive team at YouTube I truly believe that in their heart they think and they're working towards doing what they feel is the very best not just for YouTube's bottom line but for everybody that is the community creators the viewers everybody on YouTube I think they think that they're really doing the best they could do I just don't agree with them I don't think that they're doing enough for the community that's what I want to talk about any business in order to be successful you have to do things that your competition isn't doing you have to have a product that people want over whatever the competition is and then this is my very naive understanding of YouTube's business so the first tentacle of their business is search search is the way my dad uses YouTube he can't figure out how to use a cell phone he Google's it and he lands on YouTube watching a video as to how to fix his cell phone next is you have YouTube red YouTube red subscription service ten bucks a month the original content so good you're willing to give them that money so you can see their unique original content YouTube TV is 35 bucks a month and you get what is normally on regular TV but on YouTube with some other features alright the last and what I think is certainly the biggest part at least from my perspective of YouTube's business is the YouTube community that's most likely most of you watching this video people who subscribe to other people's channels people who upload people who a big gigantic community that is a web of people all over the world that contribute that consume that considerate YouTube a part of who they are and what they do and just judging anecdotally from what I've been able to gather and when I see all the time in a conversation that just doesn't seem to die is that a lot of the community is unhappy with YouTube the more I think about it the more I empathize with that perspective I think the community being upset is an existential threat to YouTube's entire business meaning that if if this community isn't happy if this community isn't constantly psyched about what YouTube is doing anything could prove to be a crack in the foundation of the company that is YouTube that could ultimately give way and be extremely disruptive to their business so let's rewind a couple months back to ad pocalypse which is earlier this year some controversial content put on YouTube that had ads in front of it advertisers flipped out and they didn't want to be in front of this content they went to YouTube YouTube immediately bent over what can we change how can we please you advertisers so you'll continue to advertise on this platform a lot of creators a lot of that community got hit very very hard so my friend saw a drop literally of 80% imagine you have a day job you work 9:00 to 5:00 five days a week you show up for those 40 hours you work as hard as you can and for that you are paid 500 dollars a week that's your take home 500 bucks a week then ad pocalypse something completely out of your control something that you had no part of on either side and now you're still showing up at work you're still working from 9:00 to 5:00 you're putting in your 40 hours a week you're still busting your ass but instead of even paid that 500 bucks a week your take-home is now 100 dollars a week okay that sucks but happens now imagine this your boss doesn't tell you what's going on you can't get in touch with your boss you don't know how to get in touch with your boss you look around for answers there are no answers anywhere and there's no one telling you what's going on will your income ever come back is it ever gonna go back to where it was how long until it goes back to where it was why is my income being affected even though I'm being the same thing I've always done and I wasn't part of the problem to begin with the thing that was most troubling for me of all of that was the lack of communication the lack of transparency on the part of YouTube the boss to the people showing up for work every day which is the community that people are uploading with a regular schedule putting the same amount of work the same amount of energy and the same amount of expense into the content they're creating but now they're getting paid only a fraction of what they did okay so YouTube's reaction to to their advertisers was loud and was clear we're going to fix this our trust and safety issues are going to be made number one we will take care of this this is a great place for you to advertise we can give you all kinds of new tools to make this possible what they weren't loud about least to the community as I understood it was how those changes are going to affect the community how they can aid the community what changes the community should expect and on and so what does this feel like from the community's perspective it's that advertisers are a bigger priority to this platform than the community so that when this controversy takes place last week wherein they D monetize a creators video for talking about a tragedy but not Jimmy Kimmel one of their bigger more corporate partners it's sort of reeks of hypocrisy and again the community the community felt like a second-class citizen the community felt like much less of a priority to the platform than these bigger more mainstream outlets and that that is the problem the community not feeling good about the platform this part of YouTube's business this is duplicatable somebody else could do this they might do it better but this isn't enough this here original programming YouTube's doing good work there I believe will do better work in the future but even so YouTube spending a couple hundred million bucks a year on original programming Netflix is spending 7 billion I think you can objectively say that in this facet of their business YouTube's trying to play catch-up but this is a long play TV will TV it's the community that makes YouTube special community is the only thing that that none of YouTube's competition has the community is what makes YouTube extraordinary community is the one thing that none of their competitors have been able to copy it's the it's the You Tube community community community that provides the armor that the body armor that YouTube needs against competition no matter what they do they're not going to get through this I think that this disruption could take place when when two things happen the first thing being a competitor shows up a competitor that gives creators access to a bigger audience and gives creators better opportunities to monetize their content so the first thing that has to happen is is a really viable competitor to YouTube the second thing that has to happen is for the community to have lost faith in YouTube I don't think that's happened I hope that never happens but if those two things the community loses faith and then there's a competitor that offers a bigger audience and a better way to monetize I think there's a very real chance for disruption within the entire YouTube community and this is not apples to apples here but I point to vine vine is a company that had tens of millions maybe hundreds of millions of monthly active users it was a vibrant vibrant vibrant platform but when the top 20 top 20 of their top 50 creators felt like there wasn't real opportunity to make a living off the platform and they went to the powers that be within that platform asking for more and they weren't given what they needed to feel taking care of they left vine and about a year later the entire platform had to shut down there were a lot of factors why vine ran out of business but that was certainly one of them a little bit of irony the majority of those top miners that left the competing platform that offered a better way to monetize and a broader audience was in fact YouTube [Music] when I think back to the height the peak of ad pocalypse I'd never heard the word twitch used so much within the YouTube community before people announcing their twitch shows and what their intentions were people going there who weren't gamers people really redefining what that platform was true enthusiasm for competitor when you think about Netflix or Amazon or Hulu or any of these other digital distribution platforms right now they've all got money they're all willing to spend money and they're trying to figure out how to diversify their audience in a way that in a way that could ultimately invite them to knock on the door of this community they may want a piece of this this is a story yesterday amazon to compete with youtube ad opportunities now this isn't exactly literally a story that's about poaching the community but I think it is I think it does illustrate the competition is looking to YouTube saying how can we get a piece of that so where does this leave us because this video is not just I didn't just make this video so I get bitch I made this video because I wanted to share my thinking with this my audience and maybe even share my thinking with some people at YouTube who might be seeing this solutions what are solutions that could be made short answer I don't know it's not my 40 billion dollar company I'm just part of this community that wants to see this platform succeed so no I don't I don't really have any real solutions but I've said well one idea so going back to the the Jimmy Kimmel tragedy monetization situation turns out that Jimmy Kimmel was able to sell his own ads against his own content on YouTube meaning that instead of relying on YouTube to sell commercials to go in front of his videos they have their own team that sells them autonomously from the platform may be at an increased rate I don't know the details are not public but maybe why maybe can I or why can't I sell my own ads why why not build us creators or at least creators that make a living off this platform why not build us a suite of tools or a marketplace wherein we could advertise our channel and what our channel represents and maybe suggest advertisers are demographics that we feel might dovetail the vest with the content that we're putting out there and because of that raise our premiums or something like that why not give us greater agency over how our content is monetized that way when there is a situation like an ad klipsch we're not collectively punished along with the people who caused the controversy in the first place just a thought here's a small one your trending page I love your trending page because I'm on your trending page every single week I don't know why I appreciate it but every time I'm on the trending page I'm cites it needs more views but but I go to Twitter and a lot of the community is gently angry at me because it seems unfair that I'm always there so is it that there's a person at YouTube that maybe it's just likes my work and that's why I'm always there is it the algorithm I don't know but maybe a little bit of transparency there maybe something that shows us the creators why I'm there icon that just says like staff pic or an icon that says like surging in the algorithm or an icon that says paid if there are videos that are allowed to be paid to be put on the trending page and that comes back to the same two principles communication transparency another one about about compensation and this seems kind of like a no-brainer right now creators on your platform get paid based on the amount of ads that can run against their videos more video views the more money that's great very clean transaction but that just means the communities getting paid one time for that one ad meanwhile YouTube the company is growing is increasing in value broadly what about something where we can choose to be paid in in YouTube or in Google stock or in some sort of way that would appreciate along with the growth of the company I know that would make me feel more vested in the platform as a creator and this one's less of an actionable more of an idea but the Kardashians show Keeping Up the Kardashians it's on Bravo or E or something like that whatever a new season comes out every billboard in the country is plastered with Kim Kardashian's face she's celebrated she's put on TV she's in magazines they're everywhere because the channel that hosts her show wants to make sure that people know it's taking place Kim Kardashian her family is celebrated by the platform that distributes her content one thing that I see very very little of is YouTube as a company celebrating its community what that means I don't really know is it more support is it literally putting people's faces on Billboard's is it a way of elevating new creators is it a way I like I said I don't know what the actionable czar here but I do think there's but I do think that there should be a much broader initiative to show like a real appreciation for what this entire community has brought to this platform and that's something I see very very little of all right I think I should stop there I could keep going at nauseam this video is literally just a video version of a conversation I have with my YouTube peers all the time but I love and I believe in and I want YouTube to succeed on every level and when I see the community feeling upset towards the platform itself it bothers me so I want to use this channel to speak up about that all right thank you [Music] this is a regrettably perfect ending to this video remember that I remember the first shot of this video where I started by saying YouTube had demonetised a really innocuous video of mine I travel vlog right where I went to Indonesia I appealed their decision to demonetised it meaning that I was right it shouldn't have been d-minus and what do you know look at that YouTube agreed with me Andrey monetized it and because of that because their algorithm made the wrong call it costs me now I don't know how you feel about having your income reduced because your well whoever writes your checks screwed up but it doesn't make me feel good I don't think it makes the community feel good either [Music] and", "label": "#"}, {"data": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] today is a bowtie day because today today is a day of celebration or wedding

what's inside how do you guys come up with the name it was my science project and we had to pick a question so we decided to do what's inside sports balls but then we just named the channel what's inside so we can have more things not just for sports yeah you wanna see it yeah have you seen it before no I'm alright it's heavy and it's like solid something so careful of it and not so we're gonna use the cuts to do do-do-do careful ok what do you do just kidding we made a fake one so you do that stun where's the real ones whatever shatter now you crowd just drop it all right what do we ready we this is metal but this thing is made out of crystal and we don't want to take the metal blade and put it on the crystal because I like my eyes my face it's what does it call it's it's led free crystal I'm sure you're good at this yeah do it will it shatter oh wait does this happen oh yeah careful of sharp on the backside a little glue let me see if I can get the metal bit off the bottom it's glued on there really well that didn't happen okay all right well now so the rest of this is completely solid so if we're gonna get into this I don't think there's gonna be diamonds but we're just yeah the logo here this one's actually mine congratulations on passing ten million subs okay I love that we're doing this do you guys know how to use a chop saw like safety we have a saying you

feel bad I honestly I don't think I would have done it if we haven't told them they're not in on the secret yeah so we did a video where we went to YouTube award headquarters and while we were there they showed us tab they showed us a blemished Diamond Award so we printed on there but it was already a blemished one that they didn't order we cut my actual now this is a blemished one you sure just a little bit of blemish so where's that good one pretty sure they should we cut the right way okay you're right okay okay so look this is an actual one that we cut in half it's real just we're gonna send it to anyone so we engrave their name on the back this was like a faulty one yeah yes but this is a genuine one if you get ten million subs this is what you get that's the real one okay so Dan and Lincoln here made a fantastic video where they actually go and they visit like the factory where they make not just the diamond play buttons with the gold ones and the silver ones it's pretty fascinating seeing like the assembly line yeah I mean what other platform does something like this where they give their creators an award that cost money time they've changed them over the years to make them better are you trying to like jockey for some YouTube network isn't here that would be nice no but I'll link it below go over to their channel where they made like a longer video it really is interesting I think the most telling thing was like that shot where there's a table and there's like hundreds of gold play buttons just lined up and it's sort of the only it's the only like realization or physical thing where you get to see how many people are crossing that threshold to a million subscribers every day every day okay thank you for watching please don't cut anything in half at home we are professionals and especially don't cut and have a solid piece of wood this is space grade aluminum okay we'll see you tomorrow on the show where I cut in half my Tesla [Music]",

elbow hurts also I wanted to say again it is an absolute pleasure having you back [Music]", "label": "G"}, {"data": "I gotta start off today's gotta start off today's episode a little bit of a serious talk this morning at like 10:30 11 I got a text from one of the guys that works for me and it said just FYI there's someone outside your door he won't leave I had to call 911 one somebody showed up here they were able to get into this building this is a locked and secure building but they probably snuck in behind someone else they came to outside my office door right here what you see behind this monitor and then they just refused to leave and Dan showed up and actually kind of interacted with the guy and film the guy on a phone I'm gonna show you what it looked like but please know I'm pixelating the guy and I'm trying to alter his voice because I would assume he's doing this for attention and the last thing I want to do is give him attention but this is what it this would look like by breaking into someone's night you know welcome yeah dude I don't care you can't do this you sent me an example of what not to do I'm like nah you are no one has ever made it by breaking in a walking of nobodies in though this is a building with a closed door and a locking key and you snuck in the front door and you came up the stairs you're making yourself look really stupid in front of a bunch of professional people here that are trying to work look at me okay see you're not gonna come in if you if you look at me yet look at me you gotta go you gotta go the doors over there look at me I know you're trying to be case you talk to Casey you gotta wait downstairs like everyone else so I appreciate dan I appreciate Sam I appreciate Patrick for trying to get this guy out of here and do the right thing ultimately the police did have to come we did file a proper police report here the crime is criminal trespassing look I don't know if this guy wanted to hurt me if you wanted a selfie with me have no idea what he wanted but when he's confronted by three people who clearly know me he refused to leave showing up at my office as public as I make the address showing up here is just not appropriate one thing that happens often there makes no sense to me as a parent makes so no sense is when parents drive down here and sit here with their children to wait for me to come out of my office I love meeting people see me in the street make sure you say hi but in an environment like this is just wildly wildly inappropriate so this was a kind of a scary situation but just in general I just please be respectful of my office space in positive news though we are going to build like a retail we're gonna build like a public space in some part of 360 a space that will be open and have some sort of normal hours so if you are in New York you can come visit and that is appropriate and it's a space that I control it doesn't disturb my my neighbors this guy's this guy's not invited okay now I will start the vlog how to vote ideas you've had this was by far by far the worst idea [Music] you've got action and you've got intent without intent there can be no action but without action intent means nothing you see my biggest frustration with 368 the series this show is that I want to share with you all the intimacy's of what's going on at 368 but company 368 the factory 368 this whole thing that I'm trying to build here but it's a slow process with 35 days in there's a lot happening there's a lot of there's a lot of action happening but I only like to share with you the action because to share the intent well I don't know about you but I find it frustrating when somebody says to me I'm gonna do this or I'm gonna do that instead I prefer to back off and then bring you back in when there's some action to show you so let me share a little action with you probably the biggest thing is what's happening behind me here see we can't open up this entire space to the public because well we're trying to work in here but we want to build a space in the very front of the store want to build a space that's like you know we have hours and maybe it's open one day a week or maybe it's open two days a week then maybe it's open more than that I don't know but a space that people who come in to want to have a merch store in here we want to have like an won't have a space where you can do like installations video installations art installations who know that's happening in real time this this this is an action not intent it's not we're gonna do that we are doing that not sure what the signs for but it's just so cool we kind of had to have it this I guess is probably more like intent than action just this isn't really relevant to this this video it's awesome they're right Charlie sure what it's for but we can easily take a picture of every visitor we have in the space just to sort of track things it's a cool project this is our jump bike rack jump bikes are motorized bikes that you just sort of rent or borrow right around the city there's a lot more happening with jump bikes but I can't share it yet I'm going to save the intent but I shared the action [Music] [Music] [Music] the office the office is not as all about intent this is where action takes place every single day the planning the plotting the future 3 6 8 it all happens right here the other thing that's happening that's very exciting is the team the three 618 is being built out we currently have five people that work for three six eight and soon you'll be introduced to them right now it's so kind of well there's like there's a lot of like HR stuff there's a lot of good reasons why you haven't met them yet you'll meet them soon five people it's happening this is the location of what will be our second podcast we're trying to avoid that diner motif here because ultimately it will be a talk show that we put most likely on YouTube or somewhere else but this is that it's being built the first recording will most likely be this week so it's happening action so that's it that's the update of three six eight a lot going on right now there'll be a lot more to talk about very very soon but action the National Weather Service and not in New York has issued a severe thunderstorm warning for Manhattan in southeast New York it look like that they're supposed to huge storm today I didn't think was gonna happen oh my well we got to go to the highway it's happening there's a huge storm really [Music] guy is madness all right so I've made it out here this is where I want it to be the wind is actually not as strong out here as it was in the city where it's so pretty strong you gotta see the sky [Music] I don't know where it is I'm trying to take a picture this boat I feel like it's fine oh it's going haywire wait the shut oh [Music] it's really coming cut it down oh it's like a driving punishing ready the trainee stings and it hits you Oh thinking everyone's everyone's like running inside and you're like let's go outside coverage another boosted board [Music] fucking doing it I'm having so much fun [Music] through this booth abuse was broken

a war zone right now but to be here to actually be on the ground in the city just kind of feels like another monday in September if anything it's a little quiet here this is not like one of my normal youtube video uploads today I want to use this channel instead as a platform to share with you a little bit of what normal life of what my life is like in new york city today that was kind of an extraordinarily tumultuous time in new york city saturday morning two days ago a pipe bomb exploded in Seaside Heights New Jersey not too far from here along the route of like a running race nobody was injured the right now the main focus is to make the area safe read later that night a homemade bomb exploded in a dumpster on $MONTH twenty-third Street about thirty five blocks from here enduring 29 people the explosion at 840 p.m. tonight this video coming from across the street a couple hours later a second bomb was found in 27 street one that had not detonated a pressure cooker there you have it found just four blocks away and then last night sunday night around nine o'clock five pipe bombs were found in elizabeth new jersey that is just across the river from here and they noticed impacted in a week one of those bombs detonated while the police were trying to disarm it then this morning just before 8am my phone my wife's phone we have an emergency alert about a wanted suspect in the new york city area and then about half an hour ago in Linden New Jersey after police shootout they caught the suspect they were looking for I don't know the details I just know the end result of this time this is Union Square totally quiet here no no noticeable extra police protection or soldiers or anything extreme like that just da just business as usual have the recent events the attack that happened to give you any pause about being here beyond the screen your safety anything like that no no not at all where to live this is the site of the explosion on Saturday night even here these are quiet there are news crews and pop and FBI agents a lot of a lot of public safety officers of the side back smoothly something now that's gonna be a lot like our chemistry like I did with the food too except like even here in Times Square feels quiet and what pd tacticals here there's an extra copy but for the most part a lot of people look like about a child soaking up the city yeah this is actually my first time here so I'm nervous anyway and it just it made me before nervous about it doesn't affect the way like you go about your life I've been doing work our help banana how how would you characterize the vibe here at the san gennaro meet everyone's having a good time always complain no one's having issues over here do you think that there's like a difference at all with the way people are conducted themselves in the city with the recent events it's business as usual everyone's just going about their business not worry darling what do you think what do you think that says about New Yorkers that were resilient we've been through before sure we'll be through again and we'll just keep buying your back I moved to New York City three months before the terrorist attack of sep tember 11 2001 i lived a block beneath the world trade center's I've never once been surprised at the resiliency or the attitude of New Yorkers towards what would be towards the tents towards the scary towards the kind of events have been happening in the last couple of days the ethos in the atmosphere that is perpetuated about what New York and what New Yorkers are is true this is a city of eight million that copse and deals with whatever it is confronted with yeah yeah", "label": "G"}, {"data": "[Music] well it's the end of the year again a time of joy of giving and of spending time with friends and family toot-toot at a time such as this one might almost forget that the United States of America is literally on fire right now [Music] horshack soon God will exact his revenge upon us for our imperfections a present shaaka this is for me Stowe you shouldn't have oh my gosh is that a Tim Allen sweatshirt Jacques surely I'm dreaming I will not be an accessory to your i'm i'm perfect i'm finally perfect and hey you know what this sweater reminds me of you guessed it the most celebrated christmas film of all time Christmas with the Kranks starring Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis and listen okay this right here just one all right just just simply one in a long line of prestigious Tim Allen Christmas films also got Santa Claus one through three look at that feel away to that how many villas in the South of France you think that'll buy him in a jungle 2 jungle my count as well but the science hasn't come back on that waiting to find out and when you're looking at something like that you just got to stop and ask how ok how did this happen Martin Short may be looking a little Martin short on money this is a prestigious article I make a pilgrimage to the Santa Claus 3 wiki every year if I can this sections plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed come on guys says Wikipedia come on who bothered to make the plotted section of Santa Claus 3 is detailed shorten it on principle there we go that's more like it anyways ain't no Christmas complete till you sit down and watch a classic Christmas flick so without further ado I present to you the abomination that is Christmas with the Kranks it did admit it did hit me it hit Sergio Strait in the day lights are coming on we should get moving got a big day Merry Christmas everybody so this film begins with middle-aged couple Luther and Nora Craig taking their daughter to the airport as she's about to leave for Peru that would in turn explain their sadness as this is the first Christmas they'll have to spend without her in a classic syndrome of the empty nest it should be okay to be better than okay I meant in Peru in the jungle please stop worrying about this okay with this again would you please stop let you just go to jungle what's there snakes yellow fever she'll be fine just won't be the same what won't Christmas with a great Melancholy the Kranks prepare to spend the holidays all alone joy abounds I need white chocolate and pistachios what are you looking for Tim didn't bring the umbrella didn't bring the umbrella I need that stuff from trips still needs his stuff Tim I didn't bring the umbrella didn't didn't bring the umbrella well I still need it Bob you said that already been over this done this okay look you stay in the car on goal because mrs. Craig needs some pistachios Tim's dirty-ass is about to go through the wash and that's basically where we're at with this film hey but at least we get to see Tim Allen do the funny face getting wet is annoying you could use an umbrella states of white chocolate good point Tim you think it's a white chocolate oh my god the flow of this movie is like pulling teeth you get any hit the white chocolate Tim that's all you went in there to get how'd you screw that up who would even bother to write this exchange it's so mundane well five minutes in all we've been talking about specials and white chocolate their cadence is so slow and they just keep repeating the same things over and over agnostic Briella did you talk to Rex who's rich who's Rex come on tell us the butcher the butcher as odd as it sounds I didn't think of asking the butcher where the chocolate was so basically thus far this is a jaded couple arguing in a low-energy and passive aggressive manner the Christmas film god bless I'll go talk to Rex right now maybe he'll wonder why I'm all wet you know I don't want what are you stupid brother Timber I can't say I'm not upset this easily could have been jungle three jungle had you just gone naked daughter on the airplane huge missed opportunity because Tim's character Luthor is so upset by The Annoying Christmas season he devises a plan to skip it all together to go on a pleasure cruise [Music] fuck Christmas I'd rather trick my own urine and celebrate Christmas thanks for coming watches Chris smoother this everyone have a grand old time the first time in 23 years Blair won't be here a lot of depression at Christmas you know tell me about it after you to whole bottle of Prozac just to get through the second part of the month we just love to forget about it what are you looking at why are you looking like that if you keep doing that I'm gonna have to call the police I think it's a former harassment if Tim Allen looks to you like this I think we're gonna need legislation is probably gonna fix itself Tim's rape stares apparently worked our usual magic as Jamie Lee Curtis gets all hot and bothered she wants to make whoopee right there on the table not even Saturday night it's not even Saturday night you know the night we literally apparently schedule having violent sex on the dining room table have an idea yeah just let it be known that I never asked to see Jamie Lee Curtis that truly sexually aroused by Tim Allen yeah but but I got it anyway hey careful what you wish for is we st. keV what's da wish for yeah that are you doing it snap apparently though Luther didn't add the hanky-panky in mind as he was just excited to reveal his genius scheme to skip out on Christmas and go on the cruise he's so horny at the idea of fucking off he tells her to fuck off it's nah but nothing tonight Jesus Christ man let her down easy we spent six thousand $100 on Christmas list with precious little to show for Luther explains that the previous year they spent over six thousand dollars on the holiday season he argues that they may as well use the funds this year for a vacation to the Caribbean and skip out on the whole process altogether actually saving money in the process it's like I said first thing about Christmas having to sit there and do Christmas huh Wow our boring stinker that is my goddamn eggnog joke's on you stupid bird eggnog is poisonous to birds for various reasons we skip Christmas well we can still give our charitable donations to Children's Hospital and and of course the church now this is where things start to get weird I'm not sure if the writers were just out of touch or trying to get the target demographic of 75 year old couples from the Midwest because just after Nora's sexy episode she starts to make a big stink that she can't go on the cruise unless they make a donation to the church you're gonna let a lousy 600 bucks stand between us and a Caribbean cruise no you are alright alright look I'll match last year's contribution to the church into the hospital but not a penny more oh thank God the church matching contribution to the church can't leave without that glad we resolved that plot point in literally 20 seconds between two scenes I think this movie might just be a web cam live feed of a real couples life night then of course like a normal person Tim's character walks around his office handing Flyers to everyone notifying them that he's skipping Christmas because as we know in real life Christmas is mandated by law and anyone who fails to comply is an enemy of the state who would do this why would anyone care no one cares if you leave on Christmas I'm letting you know that I'll be skipping Christmas this year go ahead run but we will find you but yeah that's basically the whole story of this film that everyone surrounding the cranks is so concerned with them skipping out on Christmas they get socially ostracized like they're living in Victorian England or something so what would happen if someone just literally needed to leave town for Christmas this is so out of touch it leaves the realm of plausibility mrs. Krank we've got to talk about your Christmas invitations um no no party this year no party no Christmas Eve party she's not ordering Christmas cards either indeed and a hit a rumor she's having a baby out of wedlock as well I'm whining about the party anyway because we don't want to marry yeah I think it's about time to move to a new town and change your name so the cranks proceeded to go around town needlessly pissing everyone off who is apparently part of their yearly holiday routine yeah Canadian blue spruce last year this one's a real beauty almost 10 feet tall this is Frank likes the big ones we're not buying a Christmas tree this year are we had to go up on the price we're making less per tree than last year it's not about the money we're not doing Christmas this year we're gonna go away on a cruise we don't need a tree yeah how do you like dead you little punk trying to make a decent living for yourself while making my life joyous warm and convenient I think your fucking tree how's this for a Merry Christmas you bunch of young innocent children trying to foster a loving community spirit it's really a movie about the spirit of the holidays you know really looking forward to the Santa Claus for want to know what happens in that one don't know why they haven't made that one yet at this point basically the cranks are neighborhood enemy number one and if pissed off just about everyone because they're not staying in line with traditions because after all the holidays truly are about crippling communistic style conformity aren't they dan Aykroyd is in this film too for some reason and he becomes upset with them because they won't put their giant Frosty the Snowman sculpture up which apparently every single person in this neighborhood is required to do the same exact one what is this some sort of cultish ritual hmm gonna as someone gonna say something here perfect time to put up frosty tell you what truth is I'm gonna yeah you know this movie was better as a horror anyway it was an accident what the cattle grow new spine who cares I think this movie may actually be a masterpiece you know it's got an American Psycho thing going on it's as if the protagonist is actually the antagonist and you just find that out as the movie goes on it's brilliant really Luther is just the most irredeemably horrible person of all time but the way the film portrays it you think the writers would want you to sympathize with his plight but then as Nora tries to leave the neighborhood the conformist Nazis in her town try to physically force her to give up the snowman they want from her slowly turning the movie into a Mike Meyers nightmare and what I can only assume is a throwback to curtis's earlier works don't do anything you'll regret now please look it's okay because shortly thereafter Tim shows off colorful underwear in his local Irish pub woman's bathing suit nope not my own I don't that I just I don't really know but at this point I'm numb to it there's no way we are wearing these on this cruise these aren't for the cruise then what are they for - what are they for you know it's odd does when an Irish pub serves fish tacos I don't get that you're a simple man aren't you apparently Luther got the bathing suits to go to a tanning parlor pre cruise so they could look you know their best for the cruise nor on the other hand is apprehensive dear god this should be outlawed feeling it feeling I know how to feel and then of course Nora's local pastor shows up to see your naked boobies as one does because comedy back at home Luther brings in the local paper to show Nora and they've made front page because apparently the only thing this town has to worry about is what the cranks are up to but this this is the final straw for Nora as if the Orwellian nightmare she's been living in wasn't enough she decides to throw two fingers up and enjoy the idea of the crews after all oh sorry I'm late the cancers back third time what is this bombshell about cancer what is this movie a comedy drama horror satire undiscovered Shakespearian classic the tone of the movie is never consistent one minute it's goofy the next minute is terminal illness how do you think this photographer got the shot well he climbed up on your roof yeah why did you do that I don't know Walt I just heard about Bev I'm so sorry how's she doing remarkably well yelling good spirit if there's anything we can do let me know thanks I really appreciate ya I'm very deeply truly deeply sorry about the cancer diagnosis this is the best film ever made folks is just that simple so at this point the film takes a turn as Luther enorus daughter who left for Peru at the beginning of the movie calls and says she'll be making a return for Christmas with her new fiance after all boiling Luther's plans of the trip the next bulk of the film is just slapstick nonsense of them scrambling to get ready for the Christmas party they weren't ready for and it even includes a funny ham gag and real child abuse don't hurt that child Tim you still have another 30 years of Christmas films to make you can't make him in jail unless you're making Christmas with the Kranks too Luther gets a perforated rectum don't be silly Tim leave that child alone for your own good [Music] I actually was the suicide attempts ah but then in the twist of faith like one hour in the movie actually starts to pick up a bit and feels like a real holiday film as a bigger twist and Shyamalan could ever cooked up a true Christmas miracle all right people listen up gather round we're about to have a party here at the Kranks a Christmas homecoming for Blair Town sees that the cranks need help because they can't get their party together in time so they all pitch in to get supplies together before the daughter's plane lands it's kind of nice actually and reminds me of the best parts of Christmas films in general hold on why should we do this for him sure and good things never last like this pants but we're a community the people in the community stick together even if one of them has been behaving for most of the holiday season like a spoiled selfish little baby why should the daughter pay for the sins of the father Christmas is about giving and family and love except for to some people who I would rather be in a mass grave whose name rhymes with BIM R Allen but yeah beyond my wildest expectation I actually found myself enjoying this final part of the film I think it captures the Christmas spirit perfectly even if by accident the police even help out too by picking Blair up from the airport and bringing her home just in time Luther makes amends with his neighbors and redeems himself by giving them the cruise tickets he now won't be using because he'll be spending the holidays with family hey hey this mean we have to start being nice to each other course not good cuz I still don't like you that much cold man that's kind of fucked up dude he just gave me the tickets then just before things are about to wrap up a robber that snuck into the party attempts to steal jewelry from the cranks and make a getaway [Music] my groom hey what's in that bag Oh Lord umbrella Santa from the beginning is back you know what they say if you show an umbrella in the first act you don't use it by the third you haven't written to Tim Allen film you're the guy that was selling umbrellas in the rain it's a living thank you for the party hey you're welcome I'm sorry you got to work on Christmas Eve Santa always has to work on Christmas Eve it's the real Santa isn't it it's the real Santa praise Jesus and there it is the film ends on a nice little note well in some aspects it's one of the most tone-deaf films I've ever seen there's just something lovable about it just the fact that no one in this entire movie seems like they want to be there yet somehow it turns out all right in the end and isn't that at the end of the day what the holidays are all about being forced to be with a bunch of people you're only lukewarm on for long periods of time hey in my eyes it's perfect so Merry Christmas and Happy New Year from New York baby it's 28 degrees outside give me your best Tim Allen Lloyd I don't know who that is Tim Allen you're from home improvement from jungle 2 jungle who is who's that who's Tim Allen nobody really knows who Tim Allen is seriously this

[Music]", "label": "R"}, {"data": "if this video looks and sounds different from my normal videos it's because this video this episode of tech review Tuesday was shot almost entirely on the Sony rx100 mark 6 point-and-shoot cameras see that little guy there normally I shoot on big SLR cameras like what's behind it but today I'm shooting the entire episode just on this little point shoot [Music] hmm pretty cool so I've been using this camera now for about a week and I can tell you without hesitation it is by far the best point-and-shoot video camera ever made so this video isn't about whether it's good or not this video answers or tries to answer one very simple question is it worth the absolutely insane price tag of $1,200 $1,200 for a point shoot cameras okay ah see watch me when I do those feeling fly drinking drogyn with my pot noodles smoker herbs [Music] as far as specs kill this thing is [Music] Oh [Music] Oh kids were great as far as specs go this has all the high-end specs that you would expect including 4k this entire video is in for occasion switch it over this is really really great high frame recording or slow motion ready this entire next scene right here was shot on this camera at 240 frames a second is wildly impressive stuff coming from a point ship but there's one main feature of this camera that I want to spend most of this review on and the main feature I want to focus on the main differentiator from this camera from its predecessor this is the mark 5 this is the mark 6 is this new lens on it and this lens effectively goes from like this shout which is about 24 millimeters it's a wide-angle shot to a crazy 200 millimeters ooh watch this ready still zooming which effectively gives you like a crazy telephoto lens and a wide-angle in one camera that will it's this size that fits in your pocket that's a huge deal to appreciate that is to appreciate cinematography [Music] cinematography 101 with Casey at its most basic all shots all cinematography all shots fall into one of three categories first category the close-up close-ups are great for intimacy or emphasis or you know what you know to close up this the medium a medium is this it's like this at 90% of all YouTube videos they're all shot in media then last last is the why too wide the white is the big shot that's meant to show context it shows where you are this is every shot falls into one of these three categories in any in any movie any TV show you've seen leverages some version of all three of these shots [Music] this is a huge deal or a huge deal for me for for one big reason and that's that and that's that I'm told now to achieve those three different shot categories I've had to have a camera like this with a wide-angle lens that looks like this and then if I want to get those long shots those uh those close-ups or those flat shots where the shots that show distance or perspective I had over a long lens that looks like this so I guess the $1,200 question is can this one compact camera replace these three things and that that brings me back the very question that I posed at the beginning of this video which is is this thing worth $1200 I really think in order to consider that question question you have to look at what else you can get for tall under bucks I think budgets for like a YouTube camera set up I think like what can you do for a hundred bucks for 300 bucks for 500 bucks but when you start to get into the 1012 hundred dollar range you can do and buy almost anything for example the cameras I showed you earlier this is a Canon a TD this is their kind of crappy but whatever zoom lens and then this is their super crappy plastic wide-angle lens you can get all three of these camera stuffs you can get all three of these for the same price as this point shoot camera see on Amazon you can get the ATD with these two lenses and all other crap for 85 bucks less than this point shoot these three things or you can get this point and shoot camera and I should say for emphasis that the majority of my youtube career was built with this camera and these you can do most anything with this so it's hard to imagine why you would invest your whole budget in pointe shoes instead of buying something more dynamic unless your priority is size and compact knits one thing that this camera can do that an SLR can't do [Music] [Music] last two features of this camera I need to discuss my favorite and my least favorite first my favorite you can charge this camera just like its predecessor by just plugging in a micro USB cable like this little cable here which everybody has they sell in every drugstore in America you just plug it in and it starts charging if you have one of these batteries on the road it's this is a feature that should be on every single point shoot Sony thank you for putting this here and my least favorite part of the Sony rx100 Mark 6 Sony I don't know what you were thinking there's no microphone there's no audio input on this camera so in addition to not having a place to to mount it this is what the top looks like there's no place to mount the microphone also know where to plug it in not people that have external audio on this camera will always limit its capabilities so that concludes my review of the Sony rx100 Mark 6 I hope it was helpful to answer the question that I started this out with is this camera worth $1200 to or 500 bucks less there's no question but for now it's gonna be a difficult sell incredible device really tricky price [Music]", "label": "PG13"}, {"data": "a so I I had a fun video to post today I'll post that fun video tomorrow instead I wanted to just take today to acknowledge the the school shooting that took place yesterday in parkland Florida that at the time of recording this video has has taken the lives of 17 people I also wanted to use the reach of this channel to they're linked below but to share some verified links with you of ways that you can help the victims and the families of those affected by the shooting the one at the top is a verified fundraiser from the Broward County Public School District to to specifically help provide relief and financial support for the victims and their families so and I want to now share with you the story of one of the heroes from yesterday's shooting I'm gonna read to you from a story in The Washington Post which I'll also link below an assistant football coach at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School died after risking his life to protect to protect students from the gunman who fatally shot at least 17 people in South Florida school Aaron Feist who doubled as a school security guard was shot after throwing himself in front of was shot after throwing himself in front of students as the gunman opened fire Wednesday afternoon as a youth he played center for the Douglas Eagles football team from 1995 to 1998 after graduating he returned to the school in 2002 to coach and has worked there ever since once the attack had ended a student said that Feist jumped between her and the shooter to push her out to push her out through a door and out of the line of fire several students offered similar accounts saying that Feist was wounded while trying to protect people from the gunfire Feist was hit several times covering other students at Douglass I'm paraphrasing a lot of this but the story then goes on to say some very nice things about Aaron Feist if I wanted so much as a place to sit his office was always open said Ashley spies Oh a 22 year old former student he'd sit with me he talked to me he'd let me be in silence he was friendly he was friendly with everybody but he also knew when not to be friendly and when he needed to be the authority figure Feist had a football players husky frame a bald head and was known for sporting dark sunglasses even when he was inside a big old teddy bear said the head coach loyalty I trusted him he had my back he worked hard just a good man a good guy that is well liked by his students and his players said another former student who would talk with him often between lunch and class seeing all my former classmates posting about him today shows his impact shows that his impact on the school is undeniable oh and the story goes on to say that Aaron Feist who is 37 is my age he left behind a wife and a young he left behind a wife and a young daughter there are tons of stories out there about this guy I'll link the one that I just read from below I just want to share with you because I know that when stuff like this happens it sort of feels like the whole world is this just horrible cesspool but when you look for the heroes and the good people in it you realize there aren't a lot there are a lot of good people out there and there are a lot more good people and do good things than horrible people wanting to do horrid things okay that's it please give the the links below some attention if you can even if you just want to share them hey so as I was as I was editing this video I just got an email from a girl named Alexandra hey KC I'm I'm I'm sending this email today regarding the school shooting in parkland actually attend the school where it happened and I was there when it happened and I know coach Aaron Feist passed away attending to protect other students and then she just kind of goes on to say that she'd be happy to talk to me for her to talk to her so right after this little clip here you'll see a video pop up and that video is her kind of you know sharing it's on her personal channel but anyway watch it I think it provides some really provides just kind of a kind of it's a first-hand insight into what what transpired you", "label": "G"}, {"data": "[Music] this is sad a little over a year ago over a

one of my new homies George the guys hanging with him back she works the first-class cabin this is not as good as again think it's better than this he has invited me up the first place happened to check it out pretty excited again this is not like a branded commercial for everything didn't know i was out the night that this is just booked for me by the guy didn't this airplane is amazing going up to first class with permission going up to first class even the two are we rolling oh yeah then usually it is what happened in here your magic calculation this is the bathroom gets out or just give

there we go home in the Rose how long does a person get the shower here is not going to get 32 combination with whole the recession you do 45 minutes as you can stop it you know pause and just chill on your chat have you ever showered on this airplane absolutely you have absolutely not know that that's good did not get the chance these are really something else these are good that's exciting that's fancy stuff that's rich people province that's how we roll yeah yes sorry okay is there a way that you can just read this spot out for the whole flight because I could sleep in here you got a little TV up there you forgot to get everything that's incredible this mattress on the scene the scene is like valley we're in my habit wake up baby sounds like it's popping off in the lounge laughs

action gonna get a drink it was however double thank you yeah we have an hour and a half left breakfast now and maybe a little bit more work and then say goodbye which is really really sad because

accepted we are just about to land now and i can confidently say this possible only a half my flight got layover and that this whole thing over again I got another 11 hours I can't wait Carbajal history my embrace works yeah with yeah", "label": "G"}, {"data": "so I wanted to name this bad parents [Music] [Applause] [Music] we were supposed to be on a Mickey Mouse cruise ship right now hurricane Irma canceled that trip so we came to Los Angeles tonight we're gonna go to Disney Land here in LA we don't think the baby will notice that we're not on gigantic cruise ship so long as she sees Mickey Mouse also the the Disney Cruise took us nine months to plan this trip we plan in about two hours so far so good though [Music] [Applause] [Music] whose idea was the Disney cruise originally her father's last night we stayed here in Santa Monica so we could see Candace's sister now we're driving to Anaheim where Disney World is [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] gh 5 is this shooting 4k yeah no this is 4k the focus is still imperfect but the sign that's pretty good yeah [Music] [Applause] [Music] the idea to go to Los Angeles for Disneyland was hatched like two hours before we left basically we found out late at night that the Disney cruise was cancelled we woke up the next morning said what are we gonna do and by four o'clock were on an airplane well we were supposed to be on the three o'clock but we did miss our first flight to California [Music] to Disney there come on yeah her cakes she kept saying mommy make me beautiful which meant I had to like fluff the Cape out she really thought she was in on an Elsa's castle really fact like she saw the door and she was like we're here [Applause] the funniest was every time we saw a character we changed costumes so she was wearing her Minnie Mouse costume when we spotted Princess Sophia but I had brought her Princess Sophie outfit because we had an appointment to meet her later in the day and then we saw her on the street and I was like Francine we have to change costumes she's like okay and she lifts her hands up and totally like she's not easy to get dressed in the morning but she was totally down to strip on Main Street to put on her Princess Sophia [Music] [Applause] we're not really like huge Disneyworld people who've never been before Francine she likes to watch the cartoons for the old man it was him watching her her that was why he wanted to go well he's a changed man [Music] he was like curmudgeon and now he's like a softy [Music] [Applause] how'd you do Scott and Carly were just like I could see them being Disney freaks they had so much fun scott is Candace's sister's husband we're doing Tower of Terror this is Stanley here it's the 70th birthday here here and this is Scott here brother-in-law my favorite was the Little Mermaid because Francine thought that Ariel's name was areola how did she learn that [Music] we can explain it but I can't correct it it's so funny the first day was like amazing we got there late in the afternoon we had a half a day and it was smooth as butter so this is just this is just the first day we didn't get into it to like 4 or 5 p.m. so just stuck a few rides in we saw the frozen show tomorrow is gonna be like the real hard-hitting Disney day so this is it this is the both our last day and our first real day here at Disneyland we had breakfast this morning with Chip and Dale is pretty exciting so far I think the whole thing is off to a very very good Stanly 70th birthday seems site the babies seem happy yeah so far sweeping success and then the second day was sort of an unmitigated disaster she was tired friends who just freaking out the entire time I would figure she did like it's a small world she did like it she's good like if she said she wanted to do it again when we got out [Music] the neethu reason why this video is click baited as bad parents is because we do spoil her too much and I think this might be like the height of spoiling her we justified it as Candace's dad's birthday but we just didn't want to let her down so instead of being rational humans and postponing the trip we got in a plane and flew that day to Disneyland then everybody had such a good time great trip still get out of 70 years of birthdays is this the greatest one you've ever used it really is it's a good one right so that's kind of it that was our whole Disney trip and we still do want to go on a Disney cruise but like I think for toddlers the cruise must be just amazing we'll go we'll go we're gonna go we're gonna go we're gonna go we'll go [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] was it a successful birthday [Music] I didn't know you wore glasses I can't see my computer otherwise I start to go cross-eyed", "label": "G"}, {"data": "[Music] another another another drone review video Oh analyzed our hello for me Farmingdale Long Island home of Adventureland because Adventureland is so cinematic and I happen to be out here in Long Island it seemed like a perfect time to do a test of the brand new of the DJI phantom4 pro quick caveat this video is not sponsored by DJI or any other companies this is just a tech review this is the latest and greatest from DJI it looks exactly like the Phantom 4 but it has more sensors and a much much better camera I just got it yesterday I did an unboxing press in today's video is going to be pitting this consumer camera versus DJ eyes prosumer camera this is meant for sort of novice and hobbyist this is them for semi-professional now for good forum also can be flying the DJI mavic DJI Maverick is a much smaller consumer hobbyist drone also my favorite new tech of 2016 this thing is incredible but it's image is limited which is why I'm excited to try out this pro here today obviously there are a lot of hardware differences across the zone to your thumb avoc is the most compact tiny controller that you need a phone for close part of the Phantom 4 Pro is that the screen is built-in you don't need a phone for this sucker and then this is just like now the main thing how to determine is is this thing actually better than this thing or is it just slightly bigger cooler looking and harder to deal with to figure that out I've recruited my brother who is slightly bigger cooler looking and much harder to deal with to pilot the bigger drone we're both flying in full-auto on the camera so no manual settings [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] that's some important considerations here the lighting conditions that we're flying in that day were not optimal it was really flat and everything is kind of even looking this thing doesn't perform a low light that's not really represented here [Music] [Music] this really isn't like a one is better than the other situation there isn't like a winner and a loser here I mean they're all let me let me explain this is a prime example of something I talked a lot about when it comes to camera gear called diminishing return my name is Blaine [Music] [Music] your groan analysis with thematic phantom4 pro and the inspire one professional and its repackage here you've got your you've got your value ease of use and the quality of the image the Mavic clearly has the best price the phantom moderately-priced the inspire is expensive when it comes to which one it is to fly the Mavic is the easiest to fly no question the phantom is pretty easy to fly and the inspire is well it takes a little more practice it's hard to pitch it's not that easy which land finally on the quality of the image image quality automatic is fine image quality on the Phantom perfectly good image quality aspire is borderline professional so it's hard to say which one is best it really depends on what you're looking for what the priority is so if you're watching this video at all thinking about buying a drone and then this is you still don't know where you should land here's a here's a good way to think of it this Mavic I think yields an image that is closely like and maybe what like a high-end galaxy phone would look like or a an iPhone would look like really great quality people look outside here that looks great but a profession some with a keen eye might the pro here is a big step up and I would liken the pro to something closer to life like maybe a low-end SLR super high-end point you like a really high quality image that when people look at that they might be like wow that looks professional and then the big guy my little brother took at home on a half the inspire I would like into the camera that I'm shooting this on right now this right here this is like a Canon 5d Mark 4 it's a prosumer borderline professional camera that people will see and they'll say I look like that looks like a movie or a TV show that looks so pro so that's kind of it which one's my favorite this one it's just so small thank you I'll be back soon with more technology reviews [Music]", "label": "G"}, {"data": "so maybe you've heard the news by now but yesterday we announced that I sold my technology company beam to CNN and with CNN and my team at beam and my partner Matt Hackett we're gonna be starting a new like media and technology company it's a very big deal it's a very big announcement and I wanted to explain to you as much of it as I can in a YouTube video so this video is going to be I sold my company told in five parts okay part one the blog a question I've been asked a million times since yesterday is this why I killed the vlog is this why I stopped blogging and the answer is yes and no I was genuinely bored I was exhausted and creatively depleted when it came to making that blog and I felt that way for the last several months and the reason why I kept going is because I wasn't entirely sure what to do next so I would have stepped away from the vlog regardless I don't know what else I would have stepped into and this opportunity definitely provided me with the the catalyst to actually shut the vlog down again just as a caveat I'm not vlogging I'm still youtubing very very much so if you didn't see the video I posted two days ago from Vietnam check it out took me three weeks to make I'm gonna make a whole video about what it means to be an entrepreneur and what my experience was like but I couldn't make this video without talking about fear I've done so many scary things in my life jumping out of airplanes helicopters over Afghanistan is in there is nothing I've ever done that has scared me as much for as long at a time I starting a company and I think the reason why is you know we had to raise millions of dollars to start bheem and in order to do that you have to go to people you trust some people you know some people you don't and you have to put yourself on the line and say believe in me and that belief in you is substantiated by them writing you a huge check tens of thousands hundreds of thousands millions of dollars and the reason why this fear is just omnipresent when you're starting a company is to fail means having to go back to all those people that believed in you the entire amazing brilliant geniuses that are the team at being my partner Matt all of the investors that put their money on the line all of that in aggregate just yielded a terror that I might fail and let down all these people that believed in me I'm not bringing this up to be self congratulatory or anything like that I just but to omit that part of this narrative from this video I think would make this incomplete the future so if you read any one of those like hundred articles about what we're doing none of them actually say what it is we're gonna be doing with CNN are you making an app for them are you gonna have a TV show I have no idea it's probably not gonna be I'm Casey dice dad and this is CNN part of the reason why I was so excited about working with CNN is they believed in me they believed in Matt they believed in our team so much that they just wanted this relationship to happen and then we'd figure out what it is later so that's what our focus has been it's like how do we pull this together how do we make this happen how does this make sense we did all that and now we're gonna figure out what it actually is money everybody loves to talk about money I saw a lot of YouTube videos talking about this CN n partnership the CNN deal and everyone just wants to talk about the money there are a lot of huge numbers being thrown around out there and and this is not winning the lottery there are a lot of people involved in this this is in no way just this deal is in no way just me also just as part of that I don't know why but for whatever reason making money on YouTube or as a social media person or in general is something that people love to all over on YouTube that's something I will never understand I think if you watch this channel you know a little bit of my background and you know that that when I started my career at age 17 I was on welfare I had nothing everything I have in my life has been owned and I'm very proud of that and I don't hide from that but I'm excited about what this means I'm excited that this means that I will be able to continue to provide for my family but I'm not gonna be buying a private jet anytime soon or driving a Ferrari I don't just thank you for watching these videos but if I didn't have people that cared about for whatever reason about what I share I wouldn't have any of this and whatever this next journey brings I hope you're interested enough and to at least check it out or come along with me but everything I've ever done has been because of people like you who have shared your time in watching what it is that I put out there so I mean it what I say thank you so that's kind of it I hope that this shared I hope that this sheds a little light on what's going on and look I really I don't know what's next I don't know what the future holds for me and my career and YouTube and this new company and this whole thing I have no idea but I can tell you when I look back at my life there are a lot of times when I've stood at the bottom of a gigantic mountain sometimes figuratively like when I was 17 and had a baby and sometimes literally like when I had actually climbed gigantic mountains this is me summoning the tallest mountain in the southern in Western Hemisphere and I can tell you all those journeys all those journeys have taken in life I've never known how to get to the top of that mountain I've had no idea what that would look like or how to do that but I always knew where to start because every journey big or small professional or personal figurative or literal every journey starts the same way you take one step forward one step closer to where you want to be and this this whole new company CNN thing this is the next mountain that I want to climb I hope you'll come with me and today today is step one", "label": "G"}, {"data": "[Music] so what look what are my fellow weather gear waterproof pants or protect it waterproof cell phone still wet today today I'm going to be unboxing my new camera okay camera unboxing first I really like this hat thank you for sending it to me as I mentioned in an earlier talk about my new gear setup my main shooter now is this thing the Sony a 65 hundred this is what I used to use this thing is much much smaller I also am constantly impressed with the image quality of this Jake and I shot a video for beam last week and we shot half of it on his gigantic red in 8k and we shot the other happen this little guy cut them together hard to distinguish one from the other but I want to get back to what I used to have this dorky camera stack on my hip at all time I used to call this my daily carry like my sidearm my old daily carry was a canon g7x I still highly highly highly recommend this camera its stellar its dependable it's tough its low-light is incredible it's not 4k the Sony rx100 mark 5 very excited about this little guy now I use the previous version the image was stellar the image was better than the Canon but it wasn't that dependable and the focus sucked alright so this is a test of the Sony rx100 Mark 5 versus the Sony a7r - this image right here is coming off of a camera and lens combination that's about five thousand dollars and this is off this little point and shoot which is I remember how much this thing cost but it's around $1000 what do you think of the quality difference it looks good alright I'm checking the focus on this thing ready focus behind me so if is in front of me kind of slow maybe I'm doing it wrong okay focus over there focus on me this is how you've long you're filming something cooled me switch to your face near like hey that was really cool and when you say that part it should be in focus and it's not I think I didn't set the autofocus right alright so I wouldn't I wouldn't judge this thing on this shot alone I will give it an exhaustive test but I'm very excited about it and until then it will live right right there on my hip you got everything you need yeah I did thank you very much when's the party next week worldwide celebration though this is gonna be good thanks for the trip down memory lane I know good to see you I hope those pictures were about yeah all right well Freddie Braille me Rell van Ralph and Ralph

ya from good getting a supervisor this is it they're gonna take it you contacted them anything that is holding there's nothing outside into it and the matter I would just make me sad australia what I travel around the world I think every single month if the policy is no boosted boards i understand then no boosted boards if the policy is boosted boards are great i prefer that but you can't have this will define malleable flexible otherwise just doesn't seem fair like the the burden of information that shouldn't fall on us like you're together i mean i'm not mad I'm just you know what I'm at

this is the story of an adventure I took with my kid back in 2012 [Music] [Music] Vietnam was is one of those places on our list place we always wanted people right yes to people this is our first morning it was that kind of tired where who was physically painful to get out of bed we were super jet-lagged [Music] [Music] for the leg one of our attorney taking a train from Connecticut to New York and then a plane from New York to Tokyo Tokyo to Vietnam it was like a trap [Music] these information is not in my notebook we're only 44 minutes behind and the grand scheme of things that's nothing also it's 12 hours we had to you that doesn't really have much bearing am i screwing up you see every year towards the end of the summer right before we had to go back to school I would take Owen on a big father-son trip Vietnam was our tenth year in a row [Music] this was our first trip 2002 in the Bahamas it was something I took a lot of pride in something that was important to me because as a kid it's something I always wanted and as a parent it was a way of kind of alleviating the guilt I had from working so much but mainly I just love sharing new experiences with my boy I thought it was one two three days but it's actually one two three days okay this is where you get a motorcycle Vietnam the idea behind this particular adventure was to get a motorcycle state going on the back and then drive through the vietnam countryside a couple of things i learned quickly a lot of scooters in vietnam not a lot of motorcycles i found the guy who said he could get us a motorcycle then we got there and it was a scooter so then we waited while they put together a motorcycle that they eventually gave to us that's the bike that's our bike right there that little blue thing so we start here yes going to the hobby I was sick Bobby so we come from here yep do my job to here and then to here first right on the bike there are no words that can describe the lawlessness that is driving in I've ridden a motorcycle in New York City for years but riding in Hanoi was different it was it was chaos [Music] six hours about two hours in our motorcycle journey it's much calmer now it's cobber it's not top eventually we escaped the city and landed someone that looked a lot more like what I had imagined Vietnam look this is snake one it snakes in there if some these snakes and snakes and bees and honey I guess they just let it ferment and that snake one this is just all bumblebees here what does it taste like that's why something coming [Music] oh and just had his fourth choco pie of the day look at your teeth calling us your teeth give me a smile those teeth let me see that I know I made it seem like this was an adventure me a story about riding a motorcycle through the jungles of Vietnam but it's not this this is a nostalgia movie this is a movie about what my relationship was like with my kid four years ago see when I think of my time with my dad I only remember moments moments of he and I in the car together moments around holidays but I was one of four kids he had a full-time job we never had solid blocks of time together and when I look back at my relationship with Owen all I remember are these huge chunks of time that we set aside just to be with each other we're rearranging all the furniture in our sleeping quarters to optimize exposure to the fans it has its 99 degrees up here with 99 percent humidity careful don't knock down the curtains [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] this is the bridge we just crossed I don't know that I'd call it super safe seems fine no one has a little fan club over here the motorcycle trip was like four days it was fun it was hard it was fun the first day and a half Owen didn't have a seat he's sitting on the aluminum cage on the back of the bike as passenger on the motorcycle Owen seat which is this metal right here is not terribly comfortable so we're going to appropriate this pad for additional personally I use an old inner tube to attach the cushion I think it's pretty good comfy we weren't going anywhere there was no mission no real finish line no destination it was entirely a journey of experience and along the way there were things that really stuck out and it was the weirdest things like I don't think either of us will ever forget the hot-water heater in this house we stayed in okay this is where we're staying describe to me the shower wiring situation see this is the shower here that's the hot-water heater there raw wires there amazing situation here the bank I shower situation changer I [Music] literally have no idea how we ended up down below with two women and a baby [Music] oh and being in the middle downtown and town I can you couldn't see him either you could have to trust your father we eventually made it back to Hanoi the motorcycle adventure was over we did run out of gas on our way back we ran out of fuel but the trip wasn't over we spent the night exploring the city and then the next thing we thought 35 percent alcohol by volume so that's about as strong as vodka and it comes in a one gallon plastic jug it cost three dollars we didn't buy the booze but we did decide to spend our last couple days in Vietnam going on a boat trip carabao yet let's hope that now for whatever reason I don't have a lot of footage from this boat trip as you know that there was a mother American tourists on the boat with us and and well doing karaoke I got terrifically drunk off very inexpensive wine [Music] I spent most of the night peeking overboard while it was asleep and the next day on the boat didn't do much of anything [Music] that was kind of where our Vietnam adventure ended no my intention for this was to make a travel video instead though I found myself editing four year old footage and experiencing this time with my kid all over again do you remember our trip to Vietnam uh-huh what do you remember that trip what do you think of when you think of that trap the cruise the biking team this trips like that now that you're now that you're old now there is nothing in life that highlights just how fast time passes like watching your kids grow up and to see this knowing what the next four years of parenting was I guess to look back if there was one thing I would have done differently it would have been to go on more of these adventures with my boy but that's the thing you can't change the past I am glad though that I can look back on this time I can look through these video clips and read this notebook [Music]", "label": "#"}, {"data":

the right thing to do thank you very much there's this passage there's this passage I toward out of newsweekmagazine the articles about people who work until like they're 90 years old this is a quotation from 74 year old doctor who works 80 hours a week and he does heart transplants and what he said is there's no reason to stop if you're constantly thinking new thoughts in dealing with new problems it refreshes your brain cells and makes new connections that is really like when i first started doing daily have this whole like thesis that pontificate about and the underlying premise is that if i have to constantly every day make something new it will keep me thinking keep the brain going in this vacation was all about relaxation it's just like sitting around doing nothing and like the neurons work firing that was literally getting frustrated because i had to relax I totally lost track of time I never late the gate definitely gave right now yes it was great to have the week off sleeping in was magical getting drunk every night with Candace and I mean to think about the uploads all that was great but making videos everyday is like the sense of purpose it gives me this it's like what I do it defines me it's who i am and when I stopped doing that even differently when I stopped doing that I felt like there's constant questioning myself with what like what do I have to show for today without my blog the answer was not well super late they're waiting around christmas to you thank you ladies will buy Rushmore is one of my favorite movies and there's a senior Rushmore

tonight like maybe get dinner some barbecue or something healthier get full bowtie it is a beautiful summer day here in late October today is a short run and then later this morning this morning to go work out with a friend of mine I don't know what that means but he's like a pretty serious guy eight miles at a 737 pace not bad not bad for a maintenance run [Music] the owner of juice press guy named Marcus awesome guy he's a little bit of an animal like he used to be you're still as a professional kickboxer Plager he's been inviting me to go work out with him for a while today's the day I'm taking him up on that offer I hate to go all Leonardo on you but I look after at least mention the global warming crisis is late October here in New York City and it's about 85 degrees out today it's lovely it's also terrifying [Music] yeah I'm doing the real thing here your your christening our healing space this would be the first thing you can you can come get a smoothie and worked out it's a very special space we want to use the space for only those who really need it or those people like yourself that can actually I'm not saying we really really need it what are you saying about me Marcus I mean I know I've put on like a little bit of weight I don't mean it like that I mean so the idea is there's no commercial enterprise here so the two type of people that I want to use the space for people that are sick or someone like yourself you're you're a universal conduit for connecting people in the world that you understand how how much 20 I think I do understand so and you can count on me I probably probably need the 8 mile run this morning this is seems adequate [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] we just finished it finished with the race around the block which I think neither of us needed it's like we were good before that race you should have beat me by a lot more I'm like 20,000 years older than you and you're almost laughs you Marcus you did but you should have like nine lap me I'm like a hundred there was some mention of a free smoothie involved you gotta lie on the floor do this okay thank you for the ice pick thing thank you very much you did excellent appreciate it I'll see you soon I hope bye guys I appreciate it good thanks to the smoothie thanks for the workout Sam I guess that was that was awesome this morning I need more of that in my life that woman Emily that trained us she was or is a professional Thai boxer and I used to train at the gym that she teaches that so back when I was fighting used to fight a lot with her she's amazing to go from something that's like really physical and macho and that's not that macho to something super nerdy I don't know that you care about this but this is like a huge part of like the really interesting aspect so heavy of what I do which is like how to deal with everything that I shoot all day every day this super SuperDuper fancy set up over my shoulder here mostly all this does is play The Godfather 1 The Godfather 2 on a perpetual loop but I also use this to like catalogue all of the stuff that I shoot to make these videos not when you shoot a video every single day you accumulate so much footage and when I shoot in HD like this in 1080 it's like 20 to 60 gigabytes a day when I shoot in 4k which I seldom do that's like 300 gigabytes a day this white drive here is 24 terabytes completely full this drive here 20 terabytes completely cool this drive here 20 terabytes completely full what am i excited about today this thing here this is a 64 - there's a thousand gigabytes in a terabyte so this is this is 64 thousand gigabytes now one thing that I am particularly proud of is how meticulous the organization of all of my footage is the reason why in these vlogs I can like always cut back to old scenes no matter how many years ago it might be is because everything is organized to a tee on these drives people always ask me how I do that it's not that complicated it's also not that interesting I just have a system if you make videos you know what to do all the footage you need a system before I draw up my system.out I just want to share with you a friend of mine great guy huge vlogger daily vlogger and he deletes all of his footage the minute he clicks upload alright so here's my system it sort of looks like this ready I got my Drive so the drive is right here and then in the drive I've got my footage folder after the footage everything's organized by year you pick your year say you want to dive into 2015 you got your months here then you take your month so you want to jump into March and then you've got your days days are right here ah here's where it gets sort of interesting click on March 3rd and March 3rd each camera that you captured on for that specific day then when you click on that camera all the files are just dumped in there in chronological order and that's sort of it it's super super basic I even was like very insecure about making this video because even though I get asked about it on a weekly basis that seems so boring and obvious to me that I don't know why you would think this is interesting if you didn't think this was interesting I'm sorry hi Marla what's good anything I need to know no really all right well you what you need to know nothing I don't know anything I think I'm good to see you take care of [Music] and uptown right now I'm meeting Candace on 20th Street tomorrow is Candace's birthday she asked me to help her find a couch or something like that it's her birthday so I have to you know go hang out not that I don't like hanging out my wife honey I don't like to furniture shop but I came to hang out with you because I wanted to see you where would that go you like everything that's it we're

problem minor crisis his boss whatever earring hook earring no earring prices I'm gonna go back okay look okay here's the thing if I find this I'm a hero but there's no chance I'm gonna find this if

was searching under his feet with a flashlight what do you want now honey a cake it's your birthday great date last night", "label": "G"}, {"data": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] you ready are you ready to make this movie yeah I'm ready [Applause] welcome to the long-awaited Casey and Roberto's guide to running four new runners I'm Casey I'm an amateur but very passionate welcome Roberto mange an Olympic runner four oh one point seven sixty four fifty five split twenty-nine thirty five forty ten Roberto when you land in the Olympics did you metal-faced Casey yeah no it was a very competitive race as the Olympics no metal huh no but I mean those are participation medals you know everybody gets them so what we're trying to do is like answer questions for really for new runners so we asked people on Twitter to ask us questions we're gonna answer their questions and give us an informed as informed advice as we possibly can have you did you run yet today no did you bring here you bring your running bus oh yeah I sure did ah there's a trick to putting on your running clothes I bet you Roberto don't even know this trick okay ready so if you ball up your running clothes like this and then just take them and whoa does that work huh we're gonna answer your questions while we run we need the questions we're just gonna we're gonna do the questions here I think this was a good one too definitely what is your advice for absolute beginners absolute beginners I'm gonna go first I'm gonna first here's my advice of Eunice's how I started running if you've never run before focus on time and time alone so set yourself a goal like can you run for two full minutes two minutes without stopping if you can do to get to four once you get to ten minutes without stopping get to 20 until you hit an hour that took me like four months and I started running good advice spot-on just gradual start everybody starts a different place but something where to build up from yeah what are the best shoes what are you running I exclusively run a New Balance that being said there's the shoe out there for everybody no two feet are the same I run almost exclusively in Brooks I'm in Nikes today Asics are good New Balance are good and Mizuno's good they're all good it's just what works for you because every foot every foots different lucas asks okay Lucas asks how do I stop running away from my problems I'm only answering that joke question because I I literally run to get away from my problems like what I'm having a tough time running makes me happy I'm having problems at work whatever having fights with Candice but I'm just getting angry a run does cheer me up I literally run away from my problem that's why I run 70 miles a week that's a great question [Music] Maron asked what is the difference between running on trails and roads and running on a treadmill and which is better I see no reason to run inside almost ever trail running and running on concrete I personally love trail running I just love getting outside get with my thoughts feel nature and what's the difference like is it better for you um yeah I say running on trail softer surfaces it's easier on the joints so a lot of people aren't aware that I'm running on concrete all the time it tends to beat you up a little bit even if you have proper footwear that's why I'm hurt every year well he also runs a lot do you stop for water a lot Jeremy wants to know do you warm up or just go for it you warm up no I just gradually build into it I never warm up if it's a short race like a 5k I'll warm up but for my training runs like every day I never warm up I just go outside thank you maximum distance covered in one run I think the most for me if I see the 32 or 34 miles whatever you get lost no I just love distance all right for me I ran 29 miles once by accident I actually got left behind so I had to get home [Music] [Music] [Music] there's one from gand I think it probably a lot of people struggle with but how do you get out there on days when you're not feeling motivated good question remember - what got you want there in the first place what your goals are there's gonna be good days and bad days motivation for me is just like running makes me so happy if I don't run a miserable and that's kind of that's kind of all I need okay ash Ashley wants to know I used to run a lot and I've fallen out of it any tips for getting back into running can't stop one stop a break here and there it's okay but you're gonna make the biggest gains by being consistent in your training so again just try to get out there neither avoid it neither of us had an answer for that question I'm not seeing this question here but I want to know from you mm-hmm for my own well-being do you stretch if I'm gonna stretch it's gonna be after the run when your muscles are more warmed up before nope definitely not before unless he do a slight warmup run so never stretch cold don't stretch cold can lead to injury goodbye all right last last question I don't think anybody asked it but I'm gonna ask it why do you run Roberto great question I like I personally run because is my journey of self-discovery I want to

sick yeah yeah now you have to smash like on the video Oh doesn't it see lightning doesn't strike twice this is what I've been talking about no god this is honestly one of the worst parts in the game this was the first time that I saw the monster for the first time when I played it so you can I think I played it for like four hours or something that I had to meet four or five hours to get to this part right Thank You mr. chair and I had just been so diligent to make sure I don't run into him so I had so much fear of the unknown just built up and then what happened was I went in here I think no it was one of these similar rooms and I I don't know if I wore my headphones the wrong way or what happened but I heard him and I went inside the room backwards I'm explaining this very poorly but it's oh it's a worse scare of my life I'm not kidding like I've never been so scared my life it's like I think the monsters over there I open the door then I hear a noise the monsters in the room but I'm like oh shit he's over there so I go in like this we'll get to that reaction later but oh my god that were scared by life I don't think I've ever been that scared and I'm walking in circles now

further I've arranged for a bed a dare moolah the village is only in my love the names they came out went on to write I tried to sleep but as I close my eyes I see the man who fell victim in London my

fine you need help is that bread bread is that you right stay right there bread all right let's go to a receptive column I'm coming for you buddy receptive Callum everybody yeah this is debate I'll never forget this bit ever Jesus because you go in here and you read this stupid no worries now great Brandenburg is a majestic creation perched upon a forest clad Hill with towers reaching well above even the highest pine trees following the winding road leading to the gates it's the impression of discovering something forgotten as if journeying with Marco Polo to the Hidden Xanadu Xanadu zonda the Baron is a peculiar but gracious man and he once stood well versed in worldly matters and is not at all as eccentric as I assumed my room is exquisite and I'm confident that no hotel for miles could even hope to match it Wow as the Sun sets on brennenburg its fairytale varnish turns to an eerie gloom Alexander's strange servants are never far away they are a quiet lot and their behavior could only be described as skulking Alexander seems pleased by my presence as he puts it it seems like I got here just in time interesting I forgot about this so now if you touch that stupid door how's my son doing there'll be enough time bro be cool we'll play this game anymore oh my god oh my god oh my holy fuck fellas jesus fucking christ oh my god oh my fucking god oh Jesus Jesus oh my holy oh this game is gonna give me a heart attack that was the most horrible thing ever holy fuck I can't do this anymore he will be in there yeah sorry bro I'm not going so we'll be ready it's fine Oh God I got that I'm so scared now look I lost my sanity I don't know if it uncovers actually I need to drink a lot and then okay so we got one of these this is so annoying I don't know why they added this because it just makes you like sick yeah it's almost like I need to die on purpose to get this away it's really it's stupid how do you do that that's probably one of the biggest flaws of the game as I would say excellent condition Oh all right yeah he broke down the door what an asshole and there's not nothing even in here that's the best part oh I had lighten him okay perfect should be a little better now yeah there you got look oh of course of course I don't even have to cook anything I remember now leave me alone I'm making cake bread cake again Jesus Christ it's my brain did we cook it or it's his acid go to all acid we should just drink it honestly that's what I would have done it's been like all right it's been real but bright ain't worth it no no you cannot roll me like that you cannot throw me like that okay surely now he's gone shut up shut up I don't care I don't care I don't care I don't care whatever virgins idiots but donk a donk badonkadonk oh yeah Demond in times right there okay so kitchen now we'll go to the recipe no that's right I'm bringing carpet with me just in case thank you for being with me bitch no one really picks up at carpet these days okay that's cool I know you like bread okay I know you're his favorite but I think we could have some good times you never had a good time with a carpet before kind of plucking all my view sorry there you go very nice why it's okay it's okay just put me down and I'll protect you there you go that's right that's perfect like they like that I'm not supposed to be here shit just close the door Felix hurry okay so ridiculous I freaking told you Felix thank you carpet so much people don't appreciate carpet these days okay so now you add the acid it would be no good what are you kidding me are you kidding me which door is it then I don't know could it be could it be oh yeah because he Brooks hmm ah this must be it yeah yeah yeah oh yeah oh yeah smashed I'm great Oh oh fuck you dude get the hell out of here oh yeah oh god carpet carpet okay carpet I'm leaving your bag orbit the carpet not Garber hey hey it was like a father to me I loved him like a child Hey look we're here now hustle time so you use the drain sewers as a means possible yes an underground spring greased quite spacious it seemed only natural to incorporate it into the overall structure but we won't not today the flow is seasonal and when the spring test-drive the dad tunnels produce a rather poisonous type of course we're almost there this is a really cool area I forgot about this they really they really did a good job designing puzzles I don't know it's cool oh god it's a water monster here oh god it's too deep all right so we need to drain it duh okay well it's pretty impressive for a castle to have this so I I don't know I thought I remember that you had to like throw something at the ladder maybe I'm wrong a greased because this is in the way hmm I don't know I honestly oh here we go convenient glass jar that we can use to grease let's Greed's it up baby that's my catchphrase in life huh now it's dammit god dammit we were so close the broken pipe is blocking whoever it's someone damaged so now you throw that's why yeah we do it again of course hope smash yeah alright the lighter is me and the pipe is t-series watch this guys take this got him got him that's what you get tea Suey's yeah that's everyday you climb ladders in this game surprisingly in the wonder where I should go all right oh I feel tall so now of course what we do is we we hit this one and then we hit that one and that lowers what is his message all right and then whoa threes oh god don't do that note to self we enter the Syst Sister Sister Sister that's right Oh in this area as well this game has so many Oh God exactly what is he up to I don't remember coming for Alexandra you put patata yeah that's a word okay I really like to wait my lantern guys I don't know a faint mer break it straight alarm hello are you in there empty chamber well he can't can't be empty then can it I think this is another one of those where you have oh no what was that oh jeez that's Christ what's wrong with me okay I think we're fine actually oh thank god look we're fine thought I was a gunner just get up just just get up just get up Felix there you go good job buddy it's a lot a skillful jumping in this game you have to be really good at jumping just like I am extremely described I'm not surprised even while traveling across Europe I assumed I would have to embrace the supernatural to save my mind and life as a novice I do everything in my power to stay focused and not dwell too much on my own doubts Alexander woke me up early who told me it was time we got started on our work he was obviously excited Ashley headed downstairs to the old dungeon where he preferred to attempt his rituals his sex dungeon you know in that's only by DaVinci I'm sure he showed me several rooms fitted a specific research such as Anatomy study dead dogs and botany the crown of brennenburg must be the inner sanctum a most hallowed ground where we shall attempt to permanently banish the orbs shadow alright let's spin oh yeah I don't think that's good just a guess I don't think I did anything good there but you never know you got to remain optimistic oh god oh god I'm sorry buddy I'm sorry man you know I didn't Oh geesh hey I hope t-series is in there hey listen are you okay just tell me hello okay that's good all right well these things happen you know you live some you lose some that's what I always say so where do I go from here there's no way they're not having the water monitor in here I do not believe it well we got a little with that ladder how do we do that then how am I supposed to do this throw my hammer throw it nope don't work didn't think it would oh maybe I can just maybe throw on their throne things usually works in this game IQ 5 million I bet you were like a rabbit didn't work oh really oh really didn't it I didn't do it I did it I mean I mean I okay alright look at this dude look at this using my orb Alexander managed to channel its power on to us I feel like the orb is is another word for sex and he makes this game scarier it was like standing in a mad world pool of impressions it was terrifying but Alex are the kept calm just change orab with venus tools of science in order to tame the storm the blue light was stained by strains of red and the walls burst with pulsating tissue resonating with the scene okay Ambrose that covered the orb in some cloth and the unspeakable things the shadow is closer than he said I should prepare for a warding ritual tomorrow now I can't I can't stop imagining it and yeah damn it alright let's spend time spend time spend time yeah we did okay it's this where the monster comes I don't remember okay come on don't frickin mess up now feeler okay so I think I think that was both of them shut up shut your mouth boy oh it's over there as well god dammit how did we get there I think we have to throw a rock or something no was that not him huh alright well let's just go then Hey look there's a fish that's happening okay so now we just gotta I'd spend time spend time oh yeah hey trying to fake me out boy okay he's definitely in there it is still early and Alexander is busy preparing for the ritual later today seeing him this worked up makes me question why what does he stand to gain I realized he is curious about it all but sure there must be more this is fate foolish he will attempt to tame them the power I admit that yesterday when Alexander flooded the inner sanctum with blue light I realized we had but graced the orbs this might turn out to be more than a shadow it might be the beginning oh my god I can't unsee it now stop stop okay Oh spend time whoo five burger baby oh yeah that was epic thank you thank you thank you thank you tango tango tango oh god oh god oh shoot so I think we're done here they should have designed this puzzle differently so that when you were done with it you had to like go through with them on sir that would have been cooler just in my opinion I don't all right so we are back here that's cool now I think what we can do is we can use these right now wait we'd already done those well then I Oh could it be that we drained the pipe so we can go down there now well we shall see hope tea service doesn't scratch my thing okay here we go what if I just greased myself up you know oh ah and then when the monster hits me you won't be able to grab me see ah Jesus oh yes a fungus thing is that gonna kill me nah it's fine oh god I'm gonna die I'm gonna die I need a vaccine oh okay find a vaccine are you really asking for a lot here aren't you I don't remember that we never went in the control room did we oh my god oh my god this part this fricking part come on all right like this deep flavors an old friend back it out to you however it seems gray and was I talking about come on move there you go muscle salt I spent so much time in hearing doing this puzzle I remember I did a full episode just me like going back and forth and everyone was just losing their mind I think there's a right order to do this for it to go all the way down like oh my god that was easy I hope they did not take me long and then we put the winning crank somewhere I don't remember where you don't need to wait say oh yeah there's a missing pipe here that needs to be changed that you need to find somewhere see I'm good all right don't worry this is the pasta solving skills can I just do this all right let's not we got a new pipe hey piers I think I could read the next character in your aneasha series all right sure you got the part oh god oh god oh no oh thank god I have to hammer you out did I find the pipe too early do I need to stop the flow first maybe the work I have put into the news machine is unequaled by the reasoning of any man the thought that generation of men have passed away since I first attempted to reconstruct the design is most tiring this is a great but the limitation of this world have made my work incredibly difficult it has forced me to build a thing almost a hundred times larger than the delicate contraption it tries to emulate not to mention the flow of tame lightning crudely replaced by pressured steam pushing it its way through the pipes and turbines it shames me to think that of what the interior would have a thought of my monster inventor I'm stupid where he works with a magnifying glass to carefully fix all the part I push five men to erect up a tower abroad in ayran in the hope it will have even the tiniest hint of power found in a traveler's login okay so I think what we need to do so to add it's stuck why geesh okay there's something here another pipe might be useful later and we have these things maybe a clue right now there's no clues great it's fine why what is that effect what does this do goddamnit I take it all back I'm a fucking idiot his must have done something was this here before maybe needs to be balanced so maybe one of them is stuck maybe this one is stuck oh there you go so I need to balance it out okay so one of them is just the height of that pipe and okay well no wonder this took me forever Jesus Christ oh it's the pipes over here there you go okay I got it okay guys this is epic okay so the last one goes I guess you just put them randomly I don't I don't know it's all about balance I guess the puzzles did I put them their own order I don't know possibly yeah look oh yeah they come off okay I see look I did it guys there must be one more pipe then I'm missing a pipe must be hiding somewhere where are you pipe there you go okay now I think the only thing is to match yeah yeah you know what are you doing so I think I heard a sound before oh my god I was so close are you kidding me alright so what does this mean then alright well I did something so let's go out and check it out oh and now the second one comes down dammit you'll need a push like why all right net maybe now oh of course of course oh yeah all right oh yeah oh there this is gonna be freakin awesome let's go brow alright we did it on that note I'm gonna end that episode there hope you guys enjoy this episode if you did any support is appreciated like smash subscribe and all that stuff and I'll see you guys the

positive change of plans dan and I found bicycles Chicago is one of my favorite cities because it has yeah okay you need to look up what the blue mind theory is as such being surrounded by a large space of water actually brings your levels of anxiety down that's why I search when we're standing at the sea taking it in quietly it takes away our stress it's one of the reasons why we love the ocean so much do you feel happier since we got to the lake so much happy okay very exciting because we're here in Chicago and I don't really have anything to do it seemed like today would be a great day for the first ever 3 6 8 Q&amp;A joining me today is Dan hey look forward to yoga oh I'm looking for I'm looking forward to questions also we didn't shoot a proper Q&amp;A intro for 316 yeah boo did shoot this little nugget [Music] so those of you new around here I usually ask via Twitter you can follow me on twitter my link is a great question from Jason Caron \u00f6they what do you in Canada is planning on starting the podcast I would say realistically the podcast will be started within the next two weeks and the podcast will have a video component in addition to like the regular podcast which we would download and listen to his audio weird a video too so what is done actually do out there what what is Dan actually do aside sleep Dan's just like my homie from South Africa whenever I'm in Cape Town visiting we make movies together he told me he was coming to visit New York City and I was like I'm starting this series just being a homey that's what Dan does how many people do you plan on employing at 3 6 8 large ask that question Lars I plan on employing as few of people as possible to make that place run like a well-oiled machine when you have too many people your responsibilities become management instead of action and I hate managing people okay this one is dear to my heart will Joe be joining you in New York City Joe is Dan's dog let's cuts a photo of him so you can yes this is how many's Christmas Jes I guess I mean half horse case you don't fish yes I would love to have your puppy in the office I just don't know how to get a dog here from he's an old man okay there's been a lot of questions about me sleeping continuously in the vlog or looking like I'm half asleep hey that's just me but also a fool sleeps when he's tired and a wise man sleeps when he can and I think that yeah 3 6 8 we pushing so hard every single day every single second that I have the chance to sleep even if it's on the side of the pavement I take that opportunity will Candice make more appearances on three six eight yes what the is that hair and all caps Sami I'm with you this is just a terrible haircut I had here the blonde and this is my only option where do you see this in one year this is in three six eight my goal for 316 is to have this be a 500 episode series which means one year from now I'll still be doing this what are what are your plans for YouTube damn I think that I'm I'm super lucky to have Casey as as a homie and I'm here kind of learning from him which has been a crazy experience and what I'm gonna do with all that knowledge within the next month I'm gonna start weekly uploading on my channel will 3 6 8 be entirely edited by Casey or will other creators upload their content the mission is about a space and is about collaboration but 3 6 8 the series this series this is my series so you know I love collaborating with people like Dan and in the future there'll be other collaborations but 3 6 8 the series will always be will always be my series ok last question here's a good one from Zack Bennett how do you all foresee the content in 3 6 8 different from that of the original vlogs Zack I think it's very similar to the original vlogs but the ambition is very different I want to tell a much bigger story than just my story with 3 6 8 it's just going to take time 3 6 8 the the vision the company that everything right now is nothing but an empty space as my ideas start to become reality I think you'll see this Daily Show going directions that take it that take it away from what people came to understand as the vlog [Music] Navy Pier I have no idea what that means [Music] there's one more question that came in that kind of broke my heart and I want to address it goes like this it's from smoking Joe how would I be as good as you when my life isn't very interesting and I can't afford decent recording editing equipment I can't seem to gain any growth after two years of hard work hard work and patience are really what's required to find success in any field in life two years is a very small amount of time and you gotta be prepared to commit everything if you want to stick it out do we have to get out I had such a good answer to me creativity is the ability to be able to believe in the way in which you see the world so much that you actually create an art format and from what I understand like video is an is an outlet it's a voice poems aren't outlets music may be an outlet it's it's a personal perception of the world and the creation around that that becomes interesting and I think that like you've just got to keep at it there's so many different ways of finding execution and people that will find your work and platforms but if you just keep and stay true to yourself and the way in which you see things and that's your what your videos are about that's interesting that you need that's bloody beautiful [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] damn what did you think of your tour of Chicago Chicago's rad that you are possibly the worst to a guy [Music] on tomorrow's episode of three six eight hey I want to come I want to come pick up the bikes today can I do that I rode my bicycle fast Oh window

we're all playing Battlefield 5 against one another this is a big four three six eight it's the first time we've activated our gaming space it's it's a lot [Music] so Olli what do you think of our gaming it's awesome so uh it's insane we set all this up in two days like you guys did phenomenal oh yeah I'm impressed how do you like the machine there's really come on how you feeling ready pretty good I'm a little worried about you you should be I'm not gonna lie but I've got faith like potatoes we can pull this off we're gonna get that we're gonna be the highest bragging SWAT I feel good about that they're really good about that what does fragging mean you guys strong yeah it's gonna be a lot for me to carry the famous one where's your backpack at I'm really shy today you guys are so good at gaming and I'm so terrible but they aren't making fun of me that much even though I'm really terrible and I deserve it this is fun am I good did I screw it up yeah my coach is here hey boss what do I need to know uh do you know how to use a mouse a keyboard the other day man I can't play the controller they were making fun of me so you're gonna use a mouse a keyboard yeah I mean of course we need though like how long do you think how long do you think before I die sixty seconds over than five you're gonna get back packed by the people that are surrounding you but I would say I give you 47 seconds [Music] come outside for some air getting a little stuffy I don't think I'd make a good professional gamer not that I'd ever be a professional gamer but I'm not very good at sitting still so those guys are still playing downstairs it's great this whole thing is going so good it's like there's fun Nissa happening we have pizza coming everybody's playing playing Battlefield playing video games this was the vision for three six eight and I know this is just like a little of it and thank you a for like enabling and sponsoring this whole thing to happen events like that bringing the other group of people from these guys are from all over the country we're together in a physical space and we're working together to make things and create things and do things it's just satisfying it's satisfying to see all that coming together do we want do we want us to head do it [Music] it's ready [Music] we are not insured for this is our sick career your livelihood your family Roberto this never happened [Music] I took those guys up to my studio space after we finished just hanging in the gaming space and even though like this whole thing started as an activation for ei in battlefield 5 at the end of the day what it was is like you know a handful of gamers of him a handful of people who also make their living on YouTube on Twitch on the internet getting together and talking about kind of our experiences and that is that is very literally the express goal of what I'd hope to do at 3 6 8 so really amazingly amazingly awesome day thank you again yay for making it happen [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "label": "G"}, {"data": "[Music] [Applause] technically I'm still on leave because I had a baby but I came into the office today for like a couple of meetings he had a couple quick things done and I I'm just trying to make a video so I thought I'd do like a super quick tech review Tuesday now I I didn't have time today to work with them to make an intro so Dan's intro will come next week but it does seem like it's time to review the Elan musk flamethrower [Music] I really appreciate how well designed how thoughtful this 2d drawing schematic is here we're in company not a flamethrower what's in the box nozzle logo Nisshin propane tank fuel bracket I don't know regulator trigger goal duress ergonomic palm placement alright this is clever you're not supporting customer the lawyers have spoken and due to shipping restrictions we can't mail you your glorious propane tank bummer to make it up we've included some cold hard cash so you can scroll down to your local store and pick up some nice c3h three pretty thoughtful alright so here it is now Elon Musk referred to this in the Joe Rogan podcast he said that it wasn't actually a plane for all they did to build this was take a it's actually just a roofing torch with an air rifle cover [Music] a roofing torch and if you look closely you can see that it is simply a roofing torch you've got the you've got the igniter right here and then this is the nozzle here that the flame ostensibly comes out of there's what looks like copper or zinc plated steel piping in there back here you've got a propane adapter all this stuff here is just plastic and you can tell that this used to be I think a paintball gun or soft air gun because because where this Allen head is right here you can see there's like three one two three little spots there safety semi automatic fully automatics you have to assume that's for a paintball gun so this is it look this is the this is the soft air gun the plastic soft air gun that was used as the housing for the novel flame even here on the side where it says the boring company that's just like a plastic little plate that yeah adhesive this just glued on there so basically you you pay 500 dollars forward is effectively a 30 40 dollar roofing torch with a bunch of plastic on it that's okay I believe in Elon Musk and I like to support his endeavors let's get some propane [Music] [Music] y'all so propane moving gasps yeah thank you 10:34 Ilan you owe me five dollars and 34 cents now the thing about New York City is I just can't walk around in the street with anything that resembles a gun at all so with the flamethrower review in New York City a very very good rule if you care about well surviving or your life you never go outside with anything that even resembles a gun squirt guns pellet guns anything like ice keep them in your house so a gigantic functioning not a flamethrower flamethrower is something you don't want to bring outside because you wouldn't want something like that misinterpreted by law enforcement they might respond well in any event and then even ironically that what I feel is the safest way to test this flamethrowers by I was by using it indoors flamethrower that getting like at least my opinion on sort of the thoughts behind the flamethrower well the flame I wouldn't but we didn't put a lot of time into the flamethrower this was an off-the-cuff thing the whole thing is just a joke like in the movie space balls there's this scene where they talk about space balls merchandise what is this place what is it that you do here merchandising baseball's the lunchbox thanks balls the breakfast cereal thanks [Music] you know for me personally like don't have any need for this stupid thing no but I do believe that the boring company is gonna be a company that does like really world-changing things in the future just like Tesla has and SpaceX have and to own a souvenir like the minute I finish this video I'm putting in a box and putting it away but the owner souvenir just feels like an awesome thing to do also I love a good joke and this thing's a joke that's a terrible idea terrible sin by one I took I said don't buy this flamethrower don't buy it a California Assemblyman said that he intends to introduce legislation that would prevent the sale of the sought-after flamethrower Miguel Santiago Democrat from Los Angeles is leading the charge against flamethrower sale Santiago said in a statement I honestly thought it was a joke when the article was read to me the state of California in the city of Los Angeles having trusted mr. musk to help alleviate a real public policy problem here by executing a tunnel under the city to help alleviate traffic this this deviation come on this deviation feels like a complete slap in the face dear Assemblyman Santiago lighten up [Music] this propane tank holder by the way is a mountain bike cup holder here did you hear that yeah there's gas coming out got two fire extinguishers I've got this large fire extinguisher here which will be strategically placed here I'm going to go ahead and preemptively get the hose ready and pull the firing pin I'm also gonna be placing this secondary fire extinguisher right here maybe not so much in my frame but right right here pose also at the ready okay these ceilings are 14 feet so there's enough space for the flames [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oops okay I didn't turn this off and it is worth noting to everyone at home that the just rode microphone windscreens are indeed flammable so maybe maybe take the windscreen off before", "label": "PG13"}, {"data": "I don't care what you say if you're in New York City you gotta buy chicken guys [Music] today let's talk about my today let's talk about my new cellphone I got the note e now the only review anybody's really interested in when it comes to the note e is the note 8 versus the iPhone 8 which I happen to have right here I'm just kidding this is because the new iPhones not out yet and that's really all I care about is this versus the new iPhone I'm not gonna do a comprehensive review instead think of this is like a first look and then I want to tell you why I like phones and computers with stylus is stylized stylus and as always in the name of transparency please know that this review is extremely biased while I was not hired or paid by Samsung to make this video i have worked with samsung in the past I work with Samsung in the future so this is a biased video [Music] sighs now the note 8 is objectively a gigantic gigantic phone it's the biggest phone that I could find in my arsenal it's huge in a kind of direct side-by-side comparison it's a little bit bigger than the s8 plus it's a lot bigger than the s8 regular it's a lot bigger than an iPhone 7 I don't have an iPhone 7 plus but that's like you know that's like this big good like swallow an iPhone 5 it's big but I wouldn't say it feels too big in the hand in fact it feels really good in the hand and my jeans which fit pretty tight so slides in there nicely you know it's a big phone but compared to like what we have in our pockets anyway but the feel the feel is really good it has like a heavy density to it a robustness to with it it feels good what I do want to talk about is the idea of a big-screen phone with a stylus for me that's the magic recipe I don't know why I think it's probably like the tactile nature being able to actually use my hand to draw something if you notice I've been doing some of my vlog credits in my own handwriting I've been doing that on my iPad using procreate it's amazing quick aside Apple there's nowhere to put this $100 pen you can sort of put it there but like where is it now it's gone I don't understand that I've had to buy three of these things so far Samsung gives you this little sleeve which isn't so pretty but it's functional and then on the surface I got this really confident inspiring magnets things not going anywhere but Apple where am I supposed to put this thing I think a big part of it is that I've got really fat fingers look at the size of my fingers they're like hot dogs and that's not a big deal what I'm trying to touch use the touchscreen on a smaller phone like this like look how much of my fingers are too fat if you're inarticulate non-specific like I disagree with Steve Jobs on this one who wants a stylus you have to get them and put them away and you'll lose him yuck nobody wants a stylus but the stylus whether it's on an iPad or a tablet or on a phone it enables like another level of interaction I wish that this laptop had a touchscreen because and that Final Cut Pro was optimized for like stylus because if I could interact with my media when editing video like this instead of down here with this I feel like to be much more effective [Music] well don't turn don't turn you give me a ride Chris nice to meet you Chris it's more than just the stylist I like the stylist the stylist is important when you combine the stylist with having something that fits in your hand like a notebook but it's more than just a detail think of it typing for example or data entry on a phone without a stylus without a stylus this is how you type with a stylus this is how you type and to me that's a more elegant or organic way of interacting with something it's exactly how I write if I had a notebook and a pen and then if you take that idea and you don't just look at typing but you sort of look at tip photo editing for example there's this because precise and it's almost like using a mouse and a cursor and then this we're like fat fingers get in the way of whatever I'm trying to do this thing that seems done so it's actually integrated across the software here which makes it is that I should caveat that by saying I still haven't really used this thing but the note 7 when they recall that was my favorite phone ever I do I do thank you very much Donna thank you see what I want when I walk from a phone it's perfect more like a computer remember the palm treo that phone had a keyboard and a stylus that felt like a little computer I mean nothing stuck compared to today's phone standards but the way you interacted with it was more computer-like than this go into our Santa Monica see you can get worked on these things just by using your thumb and hammering away but in a pinch it does act like a computer you can actually get work done so that's it my thesis is more based on like the note as a phone less than this specific once I've actually played with this much yet but I hope it makes sense and it is like my my favorite phone I'm happy to have it back maxie you see it do we have the same shirt on [Music]", "label": "G"}, {"data": "[Music] today is a travel day I'm heading to Toronto for like 19 hours I'm very very excited about this [Music] [Applause] [Music] this is now we're in Brooklyn so we're kind of

cross over buckle [Music] all right I think they're stuck in customs I left the driver for them I'm gonna take a taxi cuz I have to go plan for my talk tonight at buffer fest thank you [Music] thank you nice you the reason why I'm at buffer fest this year is because Samsung is a sponsor of a buffer fest and you know I can't a lot of for the amount that I work with Samsung but what I like about Samsung is that their mission as a company at least the exposure out hi to them as a company is about enabling creators so Samsung is sponsoring buffer fest like they're helping put this big event on for creators they asked me to come up and talk about what it means to be a creator that's why I'm here okay now click run [Applause] [Music] easy even Canadian six miles all right that's not good I got a better get back to hotel now running there are a couple of no nose and one big no-no is don't eat a gigantic bag of OMG cluster bun cheese out of the mini-fridge before you go on a 6-mile run oh man time to get showered get changed and get out of here [Applause] the movie moves up all night last night with and working on it's just about done and it's really really good and that and that's what I'll be showing tonight and I feel really really good about it like I could not be more psyched I could not be more psyched to show this movie wish me luck alright I'm now backstage I'm now backstage at the buffer fest this is like where like all the props and all the lights are and stuff that movie that Ann and I were working on like it's not perfect we need to tweak it a little bit before I put it online which will happen sometime in the future but it is rock-solid to show tonight so I'm going out there I'm giving a talk and then be premiering a movie here at buffer festival this is why I came to Toronto [Music] okay so everything's cued up everything's checked and now it's just like 10 minutes or something before I go on [Music] and we just show the Edit guys all right that's it Canada thank you for having me ah New York City now I got to see Francine and I gotta see Candice and I gotta I gotta go home [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Wow I made it back I just want to end this video by saying that this supreme bag here this is a fake this is made out of plastic a friend of mine got it it's like a Chinatown special I think it was 50 bucks I just thought it'd be funny to troll all the hype piece [Music]", "label": "G"}, {"data": "okay [Music] it's 9:15 in the morning and on this run I passed no less than four different groups of people there were just sitting around smoking pot who is more 5:00 in the morning [Music] probably get like I don't know 10 maybe 15 days a year in New York City they're like today that is like a unrelenting sweltering unbearable heat with a hundred percent humidity it's that I absolutely love the heat I love a heatwave like nothing else and I wish he had more he can't say I love your blog I wanted to send you some artwork to show my appreciation for the amazing horn you thanks ray squishy puss hmm you're right thank you for sending me this here squishy squishy puss I will make sure squishy puss has a nice home in my

right next to the table here I have all these little hot bucks say I'm hot like right now I'm very hot and I need to turn the air conditioner a C's on maybe I need to plug in my cell phone or anything that's a USB into my stupid computer that only takes this stupid things off use this stupid dongle here's the dongle and say I want to turn on my stereo and I don't want to get up here's the remote alright well I guess while I'm flexing at all the cool things in my office I could show you something else all right one of the benefits of having and whatever a five-year long relationship with Samsung is that they occasionally send me their new gear before it comes out this is not a sponsored video or anything today is Wednesday I don't know what the date is but they haven't even announced the note 9 yet I've got two of them thank you Samsung I will do the notes my favorite phone bTW I will do a proper review of this thing as soon as they say this is I'm allowed to or whatever or I have a chance to play with it but mostly I just wanted to come on here and mostly blue most I just wanted to show you that I got it I was told not to leave the office with it look very exciting you can count on me to do a full slightly biased review of this thing as soon as I've had a chance to really play with it they announced it today so I just don't even know what's new and what's different with it but so Janice and I have been doing our marriage counseling and going to a therapist to always improve our marriage and make sure you know we're being the best spouses we can be and as the husband of a to a pregnant wife one thing I'm trying to be better as being more empathetic so she just texted me asking for chicken tacos and I'm being good husband I'm going to get her chicken tacos in the middle of the day on earth out of one says that's what you do nothing oh how are you to have an order of chicken tacos please three thank you all right so this place here it looks like it's like really old but it's not I remember vividly the first day they opened and it looks so pristine like see how it's all dumped looking right now I remember seeing the owner his name is Serge he was outside hey guys he was outside with a mop and a bucket and the bucket was filled up with dirty water and he was painting the outside of his sign trying to make it look like it was like a New York institution when reality he had just built it but now it's a decade later and this place has become a New York institution does it look like it's always been here [Music] your chicken tacos milady so I do they give you the right thing I got them for you look I got you walk them only and chips too you're a star am i doing a good job of being more empathetic [Music] can you move my bracelet from disarm yeah to this side you can do it here yeah okay so step one is cut this off right he doesn't he's like not human I am too human do you need out of protection or just me don't shame honey you're not gonna help yeah was she too would hurry up you know what I wish no should you be doing it using lasers while you're pregnant it's like argon gas which is just it's not flammable it's fine this it do you have on your stormtrooper helmet ready he did [Music] [Applause] you barely fit in this elevator you do look great third what are you doing honey just because you don't know how to drive it doesn't mean it's a stupid car what I was sitting there and I didn't even recognize the key was in the car it's a key not in car maybe it just doesn't maybe just doesn't agree with you cuz it never does that for me so I have to design in the Tesla I was gonna do like a whole review is this gonna spoil my review no but there's there's one thing I really do like okay the fact that it's the greatest car ever meant one thing when you when you push the brake and the door closes for you that's actually quite handy okay okay these sideview mirrors they're so tiny it's like what is the point of them I can't see anything you just love to complain don't you and I think you'll agree with me on this you will no car is perfect this grid leg pattern here when you're driving in the sunlight yeah flecks on to the windscreen when I let the windscreen look at this it's all black okay I'll tell you what happens when I Drive West at the end of the day the Sun shines out and it's coming right here this is all glass and the sun is shining into my eyes yeah that thing where it's like there's always an upside to something you will have a ability to always find a downside if I turn here [Music] all

flight but I had a great time here", "label": "G"}, {"data": "I've missed these little chats I want to give a quick update on what I've been up to but I also want to do more like more videos like this where I'm just talking to you I am making some really really sick like proper videos like proper YouTube videos for this channel one of them is about running I shot it in South Africa with my friend Dan it's really good this is the video here it's like really next-level cinematography kind of like big ambitious awesome movie coming soon pS running pro tip if you want to run 20% faster just put on your headphones and listen to the Tron soundtrack by Daft Punk guaranteed speed increase back when I was daily vlogging used to say that talking to the cameras a little bit like talking to a therapist I mean I don't know who you are I don't know who most of you are but just like a therapist you don't really talk back much and you give me really considerate feedback in the comments but anyway I've missed these little chats and that's why I want to do more of these I don't know maybe I'm just being like a little sentimental because my family still in South Africa playing with penguins yeah but I always have things I want to talk about like this shark video I saw yesterday and these videos serve as like a great platform for me to discuss the things that I care about another thing I want to get into today for today's video is about happiness on YouTube and all that first I want to give you like a two second update one I just got back from South Africa in Las Vegas and all kinds of other travel feels good to be back in New York City focus to the new company downstairs the thing I'm doing with CNN it's coming along really well we're going to be hiring people soon building Studios making a bunch of videos I'll keep you updated as things progress but it's starting to like turn from like a liquid of mystery into a gel of slightly less mystery it's coming along though three life's gotten kind of weird since I stopped daily vlogging I got so used to this lifestyle of like literally working 20 hours a day to crank out those videos I like don't know what to do with myself now cuz I have all this time I did build a gaming station here in the studio I've been working on a gaming setup in there you've both done so 10 more on that soon and I've been like crazy focused on Fitness which feels really great but mostly I've just been enjoying like returning to being a human being but I do miss creating something every day so that's why I'm gonna do more videos like like this but I'd say the biggest update since I stopped blogging like the biggest thing is that I have all this free brain space like it kind of hard to explain but when you're making a video every single day you wake up thinking about what's today's video what's today's vlog episode gonna be and then throughout the day you're just trying to create it and then you're up all night trying to shape it together you fall asleep you wake up the next day just like Groundhog Day you start over again [Music] and that would out for like 600 straight days or something like that and being away from that for a month like I've been able to really think about big things that I want to do and redirect my career it feels great and I hope these videos will serve as a little bit of a vessel for me to share that with you so yeah happiness there's this small youtuber called PewDiePie you poodiepee pewdiepie made a video like a couple days ago and it was about what's called forced positivity on YouTube and by the way Felix I like these kinds of videos I think they're insightful and they're smart and I encourage you to make them the video was about how a lot of daily vloggers have a sort of an aura of forced positivity or like a level of superficiality around their content and about how that can be dangerous because young people might perceive that as like if you're not happy all the time you're doing something wrong or or might make you feel less satisfied with your own life because you're not happy like the vloggers that you watch day in and day out now me as a former now retired daily vlogger and someone who gets like emails and tweets every day from people saying I appreciate your positivity I thought I should chime in on this kind of my thesis when I was daily vlogging was to like pluck the happy and fun and interesting aspects of my life out of the 24 hour a day that is my life and turned into a 10 minute video for you the audience and I chose that approach because I think much like a lot of you I enjoy videos that make me feel good versus ones that are overwhelmingly depressing no one wants to watch a video of someone groveling about how lame their life is but I do think that means that there is a big opportunity for viewers to see that as these sort of totality of my life like my life every second of my life is that happy and it isn't like no one's life is that happy I try really hard to live like the happiest most positive life I can but life is ebb and flow and my life has been no different especially throughout the vlog and I can remember when I was daily vlogging the hardest days for me to make videos were days when I was like having a fight with my wife or something miserable was happening and I would have to kind of push that out remember in particular trying to daily vlog when we were in Texas at Candace's grandfather's funeral I didn't blog the funeral but I was trying to make a video that day in shield you viewers from like that difficult part of my life and maybe that could be perceived as dishonest but I think I was always pretty clear in saying that the vlog was about the fun positive interesting aspects of my life and not about the whole picture that was my life and I think the important takeaway here is that whether you are a daily vlogger or someone who watches daily vloggers is to know that we are all human we all have struggles and just because you put your life the difference that vloggers me included have is that we have the opportunity to edit our lives and edit out the parts and leave in the really happy parts but know that they exist so I want to end this video by sharing with you what is my like really naive basic recipe for finding happiness in my own life and I will say that whatever Candis is down were bummed out or we're fighting and I tell her this she's like Casey shut up I'm not ten years old I don't need your stupid recipe for happiness but here goes whenever I'm really down I just try to focus on what's really good I told you this is basic and what I mean by that is like what I look back at life and I see like those when I was with a really bad breakup I would focus on the fact that I had friends and people who loved and cared about me and I would take solace in that even much more serious stuff like 10 11 years ago when my dad had cancer that was one of the more difficult things I ever dealt with in my life but I would I remember thinking at least he also has a job that gives him healthcare and that was just like a little bit of something for me to focus on that was positive out of a really really situation that's kind of it it's like today for example it's freezing cold and snowing outside but it's so cold I can keep my juices refrigerated without having to use any energy that's kind of positive just quick caveat this video is not at all intended to be a commentary on mental illness or depression or anything like that it's more about vloggers like me and the kind of superficiality that vlogging can have Felix mentioned this in his video too but the depression and mental illness is is real and something to be taking very seriously I put a link below to some online resources to people who may be struggling with with mental health [Music]", "label": "G"}, {"data": "Gowan [Music] before I get into this review I want to disclose that this is not an unbiased review as in this is a biased review maybe you've seen the commercial that I star in watch me I mean I wasn't I'm not being paid by Samsung to make this video I'm just like work for them in the past in fact I had to beg them to give me this thing to make this video alright in general I'm never I get it tech reviews but let's get started so as you can see the si+ is a fairly large phone when compared to the s7 and it's really not that much bigger or wider and when you compare it to the iPhone 6 plus it's a little taller but it's more slender like look touchy touchy no well almost touchy touchy and it's all about it's all about holding them in your hand this is the key comparison here how they feel when you're holding them si iPhone 7 plus now one critique that I had of the s7 edge is that there was like a little too much edge like my fingers would always I kind of accidentally activate things and touch things because they touch the edge on the I mean s8 it really feels like they fix that like there's nothing awkward about holding on to the edge of this thing the side-by-side screen real estate comparison that is how much surface of the phone is dedicated to the screen as you can see the s8 here is all screen this has got a big fat chin a big fat chin and I gotta say when you hold this thing when you hold this thing in your hand it's like the screen is sort of dripping off the edges it feels it truly feels it truly feels like you're just holding a screen in your hand and that's kind of amazing the s8 here feels a little bluer this feels a little warmer like this is more of a pink orange this is more of a blue I will say you can definitely see the pixels on the iPhone and on the s8 it's nothing but pure butter like that is a clean clean text right there no sign of pixels nothing just razor razor sharp this is where you can really see the difference I need like a pointer look at this this huge chin all this wasted surface area and this is just an amazing image versus the iPhone I mean even even versus the older Samsung it's just so much screen this is where the screen really makes the difference it's just it's just so much more screen for the phone sighs all right because this is like uh because this is an unreleased one I can't really go outside or film anywhere interesting with it so I'm gonna go ahead and do a film recording test indoors with this thing all right this is gonna be the front-facing like the selfie camera video camera test got an iPhone 7 here and I have this Galaxy s8 plus here ready on the lighting conditions very pretty dramatically here in my office funny I can't tell looking at the screen which one's better this is what the audio sounds like on the iPhone this is what the audio sounds like on the s8 let me light myself ready okay this is with extremely bright lighting in my face there's a little backlight action little my glasses action okay let's try the rear camera why do they bury on iPhone why do they bury the 4k settings in the setting menu instead of having them in the camera all right this this is the 4k camera test they're both shooting in 4k trying to give you some camera movement I mean it's really it's so hard to tell you're looking at the screens as far as which has a wider lens very hard to tell it looks trying to frame them the same it looks about the same I think that the s8 has a slightly wider lens than the iPhone but it all sounds of just a massive screen so it could be the bigger screen again I would take this camera test with a grain of salt I'm just filming in here I would love to film outside I'm not allowed to let's simply look at the still photos okey-dokey now I'm going to test the selfie camera that is selfie stills again I really wish I had a prettier test subject but I'm not allowed to show this thing to anybody so it's just me me I'm gonna test the flash on the camera alright that's kind of it that kind of concludes this actually this is like a hyper rushed first look at the Samsung s8 I don't know how much time with it they just they just gave me this thing and I gotta give it right back and while I do work with Samsung so take that for what it's worth I was definitely not paid to make this video and I wasn't paid to say that like this thing's pretty amazing this is like it's almost the cell phone I've been waiting for since I was a little kid the cell phone been waiting for since I was a little kid is nothing but screen all the way like a pure dude is just holding a window to the universe in your hand and this is by far the closest thing to it just yet soon this will be my full time like real phone and that's what I can do like a super deep dive review especially on the video camera cuz that's my number one priority and this is another kind of terrible like super rush kind of like not that good tech review from Casey nice dad [Music] not sure if you can see that can you see out right there that little hole you know what that little hole is that's a headphone jack", "label": "G"}, {"data": "[Music] very excited to say that one of my favorite people favorite people is is in New York City today in fact pretty sure he and his

happening I'm just setting it up fine we're not flying yeah not excited I'll tell you when we fly promise it's a crazy thing I'm very excited about this video we're gonna make it work so talk me

we're flying for fun we're also not flying over people we're not flying in controlled airspace what is this airspace so we're directly over the Hudson we're outside of a Guardia JFK to YouTube for all that stuff we're out of all of the aircraft approached and weird about that heliport I see right there so heliport we just notify them so it literally takes a phone call we'll be operating a drone under five pound we were to give that exactly where to do that so it's simple I mean it's not for a commercial purpose religious out testing your new toy that we've bought so we are we're following the rules which involves a boat but we're still following the rules leave me alone fa please please leave me little contact me for contact [Music] here goes there goes [Music] [Music] she's gonna kick it that's great I like to have a lot of tools at my disposal and I only ever fly small consumer drones but I have been wanting to upgrade to something more professional-looking I just haven't known how to do that or how to fly that or any of it so today is really like it's us out here messing around but it's also us out here learning how to do a level of production that we haven't hit before like will this port is ready [Music] I've lived in New York City for 17 years and I've never been to the Statue of Liberty okay yeah I'm about to have my first lesson where I fly this thing similar to flying you've got your left stick which is your dog you know left all right you want to try yeah we're rapping back yeah there you go good job going left my flat let's slow down to make it easier there you go I just did a good one want to see it ready [Music] [Applause] [Music] yeah it looked at we're really close we can't fly over the island because this is National Park so because it's a national park we can't fly over the Statue of Liberty but we have a really long lens like what would look like a long zoom lens on the camera so it looks like we're really close to the Statue of Liberty but really for hundreds of feet away from it so that was it that was my first time operating camera how to do I didn't really want all right that's not good this is really fun this is really exciting see I don't get this opportunity often mainly cuz I don't like people teaching me things I like to figure things out but these guys are so good and I love them and they're the best at what they do so and today because I got all that new equipment from B&amp;H it's just like this is very exciting [Music] are you doing - uh 368 Broadway so this is my new drone my new toy and that was my that was my very professional drone lesson I hope you enjoyed I hope you enjoyed coming along with me see you tomorrow 3 6 8 [Music]", "label": "PG13"}, {"data": "by the way we haven't formally launched the three six eight like program where we bring in young creators and they use the space and take advantage but somehow uninvited Jack coin different kind of episode today I think you're gonna like it I'm pretty excited about it [Music] today I'll be telling the story of Dan mates sup Jaime who's shooting you're moving up yep so Dan as you know is my homie from South Africa he's here in New York for I don't know a couple weeks more and while he's been here he's been helping me make youtube videos but he's also here for his own thing and that's something we haven't talked about yet on the vlog today seemed like a perfect day because Dan is gonna try to be he's not gonna try Dan is going to be making a video for his main channel today I'm gonna be assisting him that felt like the perfect opportunity to I don't know kind of explain who Dan is and what Dan does a little bit better do I say something not whoa Dan what were you doing in South Africa before you moved to New York City I would direct TV commercials what was your favorite brand you made a commercial for um it's not necessarily about the brand it's probably more about the commercial itself which was a job I did for Tosca Naga in Kenya I'm Dan Mays film director from Cape Town we've just wrapped up the TV commercial and short form for tasks did you like being a commercial director in the beginning when I came into it I really believe that that was what I wanted to do I thought that commercial film directing was my was the be-all and end-all for me I got to be on big sets have big crews work with lots of money but then eventually my ideas started but my ideas started to become watered down it started to become about a lot more than just the concept of filmmaking I just felt that the true essence of what filmmaking means to me was stripped away and I started to forget about why it is that I make phones so what does this movie today we're making today today I'm basically exploiting you and your channel to get me loads of fun Stan is downstairs waiting for me right now no joke I am truly genuinely nervous to be assisting him because like when we're shooting it's my video he's so good at backing me up and I am not good at assisting someone teaches I'm like because I'm always trying to impart my ways on their shoe hey pardon me guys dude do you want to see do you want to see how good of an assistant I am yes you forgot the memory card shit okay first team I'm gonna get you to do this three times I'm gonna take a couple to either gonna walk pass to the time body there'll be two of you yet it's as simple as that and I I make films because I have not learned anything else and I know I can do it to a certain degree and it is my duty one of my favorite filmmakers Verner Herzog has 24 rules of filmmaking here's a couple of them and what they look like in real life number one always take the initiative hold the board over yet when you walk past that mark that middle monitor essentially you nine yeah you actually have a line you're shooting down here dad yeah we're using the podcast yeah but I changed it check oh look at this this is the podcasting studio back here which by the way today Friday we launched the second I say this already we launched the second ever pod episode of couples therapy the podcast available we're all podcasts are on Spotify on Apple podcasts on anchor go download it Candice and I really put a lot of work into this one you ready number two there's nothing wrong with spending a night in jail if it means getting the shot you need food you mean the contest can we not dip a little bit of this intelligence yeah yeah today's today's video is is about that it's about my journey as a film director where I'm not where I've come from and how why I've decided to make the step in my career that sounds boring you should make it sound more interesting for the people number five learn to live with your mistakes I've lost I've lost my script I'm stressing out man it is so much easier to be directed by someone else than have to direct someone else Dan you're doing a great job - in total sincerity you're way nicer on set than I am yeah I didn't hear what I say that I go to the bathroom really number 11 ask for forgiveness not permission shooting in the sub-basement [Music] the kinds of ads that I was doing I wasn't happy making right so what do you want to be when you grow up what's the big goal I want to be uh so my major goal is to be made my major goal is to be paid to make the films that I want to make I mean doesn't that sound like the dream number 17 don't be fearful of rejection we're now headed out to the water to shoot what will be my final scene ready [Music] dan is on the boosted board taking me go Oh number 19 day one is the point of no return I mean doesn't it sound like the dream so what's between you and accomplishing that just fucking doing it the location dad asked me for it was a place where we could sit on a bench with good light no one would bother us in the city skyline would be behind us this is what I came up with skylines right there no one's out here look at all these vacant benches beautiful benches beautiful location I think he's going to be very happy with this every time what do you think what do you think this location that's good number 18 develop your own voice are you excited dad I'm sorry to be put can I get emotional a little bit of okay do it cue romantic music done dude - to upload something to my channel feels incredible I'm nervous and I'm like at the same time I'm like I great you know what I mean yeah I know it feels good there's nothing more satisfying than clicking the up look no then clicking the publish man let's hit that last shot done I gotta get I gotta get home or 10 years from now you'll be my age Dan's 10 years younger than me 10 years ago you'd be my age where would you like to be that double the amount of subs is yeah that's totally doing it totally doable Oh to be honest I would want to be living on the space of YouTube creating content that that people want to watch and the content that makes me happy essentially that's not like I said that's the goal the dream is to be like filmmaking for me is so much more than making phones so we're fully done how do you think it went it's it's tough like time like what you wish what you've been teaching me about time management that's where I really need to learn and focus on stop trying to make things perfect so after doing 30 what we've made 31 videos you've watched me make you've helped me make 31 videos in like the last month what's it like making your first video in the shadow of like that absolutely insane manic pace for today I fully understand why you so hardcore like I don't know like to be honest I'm a part of your videos every day but because I'm not directing and they're not my videos I'm kind of taking direction from you and when I you know to be a part of the whole idea consistently like working on it is very difficult thing to do you know so like I admire you for hey number eight there's never an excuse not to finish the film dan is the movie done what how what I made a whole like behind the scenes documentary in the whole like the whole movie ends with like there's no excuse not to finish what happened well how am I supposed to end my vlog now nobody's gonna go subscribe to you if there's no new movie there Dan okay is it good did you make a good movie well if you made a great movie that's all that matters alright I'll let everybody know it

Ahhh! i'm a muffin!", "label": "PG13"}, {"data": "it is exactly 11 hours after the first shots were taken by that mass murderer by the terrorists in Las Vegas Nevada now when I woke up this morning and I learned of this attack I went through this kind of range of emotions that's not that's not really unfamiliar but it starts with being really angry like I wanted like I want to do something like I want to catch this mother and then that anger slowly turns to grief where I just feel terrible for the victims and the victim's family and then it usually settles down by like right now in the emotion that I feel now is one of helplessness help us because I'm just one person and I don't know what I could do and when considering what resources I have that could help people I think the greatest resource is this YouTube channel and and you this audience and an audience that I called out in the past and that has been incredibly generous anytime I've ever asked anything I'm starting a GoFundMe a fundraiser and I want to raise as much money as possible and I want to give that money to the families of the victims the victims themselves the survivors the people directly affected in a physical way from this just horrific attack and I say with with full respect and appreciation for the fact that money will will not bring back the lives that have been lost money won't won't heal somebody's wounds money won't solve the anguish in the sadness and and everything that's being felt by the people and the families of those victims money can't fix any of that but maybe maybe a little bit of money can help someone with medical bills maybe a child who lost their parent maybe they could buy some new toys and be distracted for an hour maybe money can buy a family a a meal they can go out to dinner and they can talk about things I don't know but this was the only form of action that I could think of and I know that in times of grief it's not a time when you want to be thinking about earning or thinking about finances or thinking about any of that stuff so money could be helpful there too now logistically there's a lot of unanswered questions here I will tell you that I will personally make sure that none of this money is given to a charity or a nonprofit that will take the fee from it or anything like that I will work with individuals I'll work with people I'll work with organizations that will help me figure out how to get this money the money that we pulled together directly into the hands of people no middlemen taking a cut nothing like that this video you're watching right now is monetized I put an ad at the beginning in and out at the end so all of the Adsense revenue from this video will also be donated and all the pragmatic stuff all that will be updated on the GoFundMe page I think the important thing is to harness how I'm feeling now and how I imagine others are feeling right now which is this desire to do something and if giving five dollars if giving ten dollars means that somebody on the other end who is dealing with this can do something positive with that then that's an action and that's something I want to end this by saying that it shocks me that any one person is capable of being that evil and the shock that I feel must be nothing compared to the shock that the people actually personally affected by that evil must be feeling so this campaign should be a way of showing those people that there there's a lot of good out there there's a lot of good people out there and our desire our capacity to help maybe can mitigate some of what's being felt by by by this this evil-doers capacity to to to commit evil you", "label": "G"}, {"data": "do you want me to put you in the vlog for your birthday today's Amalia's 30th birthday happy birthday alright [Music] [Applause] [Music] see Candace drives Francine to school in the morning some days before my run I'm a good husband I'm a good husband and I go get the car for her you know mornings can be stressful in the household when you got a kid so anything I can do to help out count on me honey [Music] I think today is you know well first back by popular demand I think today's gonna be the day when I finally finally finally give a comprehensive review of the of the new one wheel plus yeah I've been waiting for good weather I'm waiting for X Billy nice outside one of those days where I want to shoot something outside and but first first realtalk sorry keep using that our Kelly song as the intro I know our Kelly is a bad bad man I just it's such a good song alright real talk if you're not new to this vlog you know in season one even season two hours super consistent and uploading every single day almost always at the same time and since I started season 3 I've been nothing but sporadic when I upload and I wanted to take a second to explain let me animate this see in vlogs season 1 and 2 the vlog really dictated a lot of my life maintaining the interestingness of the vlog the actual act of creating and then just the sheer amount of hours dictated my life for season three I'm making sure my life dictates the law focusing on family is more important than focusing on making the episodes interesting my job is more important and spending time focusing on health goes above spending time editing the vlog now now the only way to do that and make sure the vlog doesn't suck is by being selective when I do it you know like we were with family in Texas the last couple of days it was all about family the baby was their own was there at Candace's parents were there that had to take precedent over the stress of creating a daily show somebody sent me this I don't I don't know what this is you know down at beam we're working all kinds of things so we're gonna start making shows and and movies and all kinds of stuff down there that means they're gonna be more days and I don't make the vlog what matters is that these episodes are good and I'd rather make them you know four or five times a week and have them be really good then make them seven days that we can have them suck and then the other thing it's important is is sustainability it's when I think back to why I stopped blogging the previous two seasons like I started to hate it and I think it was just the roulette like the fact that I'd never had time to think it was just go go go go go which has its virtues but also after a year and a half it was just it was unsustainable so I'm hoping this new sort of thesis this this this new approach to vlogging it's something that's more sustainable I can tell you this much I love doing it again like the process now is so much more I know it's more relaxing it's more exciting it's like yesterday on the plane when the baby was freaking out and Candice was freaking out and I was freaking out instead of also trying to make a video at during that stressful time instead I was like exciting about getting back to it today you know I looked at a lot of my youtube friends when they stop vlogging like Gina and Jessi BF versus gf those are my favorite YouTube channels some of my favorite vloggers you know they talked about the stress that it had on their personal life and other aspects of their life I'm just trying to be responsible and trying to navigate that so I'll still see you almost every day I'll try to click upload amis every day but I hope this makes sense and I'm gonna make exist the largest sometimes here at beam HQ we squeeze our own juice this happening [Applause] [Music] all right Amalia here's your birthday goose enjoy it thank you I got oh I got that seven go in there one I got last week oh it is good isn't that look at the house steady it is - mm-hmm oh it feels fancy back here this is this is downstairs that beam but over there is where we built offices and little like it's very professional here and then Jake and I are turning back here into just like a raw studio space so ceilings painted black we're gonna put sound panels on them what else you doing down here okay putting a lighting grid in up here this gonna be filled with lights Lucas Mia light panels I don't know what a lighting grid is is this your personal Supper is this ours this is already gear yeah yeah this is what happens when you give Jake access with a company credit card stuff man we got this really cool follow focus okay this is our incisor I think this is really cool so ef-s lenses right they have a motor in them for focus so what you can do is like a team [Music] so there's a store called supreme maybe you've heard of it they sell like skateboard clothing an erotic characterized the dreams but the fans the people who buy supreme clothing they're called hype feet really getting to the gear and apparently today there's like the most insane seen outside of supreme oh my god this is the line for supreme yeah and that's the line for supreme and then that's supreme right there do you get anything good yeah yeah let me see let me see check it off how long did you wait in line two hours two hours pleasure to meet you rich who pays you when you got a deal with all this supreme pay you or the city do you get some free supreme t-shirts no no you just got to keep the peace so tell let me ask you then what what is what is supreme culture supreme culture man is a fashion culture it's about young young people doing things that they want to do and exploring everything man look you got little kids say you got that they all relate to supreme so much over other fashion because you see the designs the prints they real original man supreme and then the logo is strong man Supremes are strong logo it goes nowhere it's number one Casey I think nice - thank you bro guy oh my gosh what's your name I'm Chandler I'm from services girl Chandler from San Francisco like your honestly like my hero like I'm gonna cry right now like stay in school don't do drugs I want to drive the hate drug alright hey yeah alright good luck with all these kids Thanks take care [Music] [Music] New York City that have these street teams often they give away free stuff that I guess they just assume people are gonna want these guys here they give really free chocolate milk just one of the great perks of living here I'm on the one wheel dramatic difference from the from the previous generation one wheel it's is pretty incredible [Music] okay so there's definitely a learning curve here I'm getting there [Music] not a lot of opportunities to test the off-road capabilities of the wooden wheel here in New York City I really feel like they took care of all the shortcomings all the beefs that I had with the original version now this thing's like I mean it's smooth is butter it's crazier responsive it's a lot faster I feel much more in control I don't know that I'd become bull riding this in New York City traffic but I said the same thing about the booster I had my helmet I left my helmet blue test in traffic [Music] says the man not rich rich what are you thinking in one wheel it's nice right it's one day man [Music] I gotta say this thing's pretty pretty impressive one wheel you know I would say the question I get asked the most is should I get a one wheel or should I get a boosted board if I had an answer for it if you live in a city like I do boosted boards grace it's wonderful on the road if you live in a place where there's any off-road or trails or water or sand or dirt the one wheels fantastic for that so I could never ever say that one is better than the other but this one wheel is wildly impressed okay alright just give me go ahead and in the broad right there [Music]", "label": "#"}, {"data": "4:02 in the morning [Music] [Music] so I am up at the crack of dawn this morning to go run a race the race isn't a big deal but this whole thing's a big deal for let me explain morning old tradition of mind always have a bagel before a race today's a big deal because how you sir in a lot of races but I haven't run one in three years and today is me confronting that by running my first race in three years and my little brother's coming there for moral support and I paid for the bagels well thank you for the delicious bagels bye ladies [Music] Suns coming up race starts in uh [Music] we've arrived I'm gonna go register for the race now I [Music] thought I could sign up today you're not allowed to sign up race day to register they told me no they told me to go home I found the race director and he says you let me run I don't get a time though or like a bib where you put the number on but whatever I get to run it's official a little concerned about the temperature though it's freezing everyone has on sweatpants and tights and this is what I brought to run in [Music] ready starts in ten minutes okay race starts in like four minutes you know what it is I mean I run every day and I've run 50 races before that butterflies right now I think what it is like I'm getting old I'm 35 now and I can tell myself that I'm in great shape and I feel young and all that but when you actually show up to something like this and there's a clock and a time it's like an actual test of how well I'm maintained its confronting that that I think makes me a little nervous wish me luck [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] see you ten miles [Music] super super happy with my performance in my first race out in three years you know the timing tip right I'm too here on my on my phone I came at 103 which puts me here can you see this so I ran a little further at 10.2 miles a six minute 14 second pace I think it puts me around 20th place out of maybe like a thousand runners felt good though as you get older the price of maintaining your youth goes up and up and up and what that means is when you're like 15 16 18 years old you know wherever the hell you want you don't have to exercise you're skinny it's easy in your 20s it gets a little harder you get fat in college you become even older and all it gets harder and harder the older you are the harder you have to work there was this guy in front of me during the race and gray hair gray mustache he was ahead of me the whole race we started together but he was ahead of me the whole race and I was chasing him down as best I could and I finally caught up to him at Mile 9 one mile left and I pulled up next to him and he turns mean he goes 60 I'm 60 years old at 60 he's as fast as I am at 35 busting my ass he's as fast as I am if there's one truth that I know is that the source of the Fountain of Youth can be summed up with one word work [Applause] [Music] by the way the main reason why I brought my kid brother today I mean I like hanging out with the kid but the main reason why I brought him was so he could film me while I ran he missed the shot of me crossing the finish line because he was in the car getting warm thanks Tina [Music]", "label": "G"}, {"data": "[Music] your office know it's a lot [Music] I'll be doing I don't know just a lot okay should we go in okay for those of you just joining us dan and I are in the former dollar pizza we're on our way to get coffee and the door was just like left slightly open dan back in the day the best dollar Keith's in the city was there seriously there's no one in here a new restaurant oh dude it's so gross it's like sticky dough this is Dan and Casey reporting live from the unlocked closed down former dollar pizza so we got in a restaurant review restaurant you two thumbs to the proprietors of roll to

bit of this okay bitch yeah okay I just want to say before I see it that I thought your intro to yesterday's tech Tuesday was filmmaking perfection linked below if you haven't seen it so I was reading some YouTube comments and I read poeple that really hurt my feelings and I wanted to address them the gist of these negative comments were like what happened to three six eight I knew it was bullsh this is just a regular vlog why don't you talk about three six eight anymore three six eight is a fraud you don't know anything about business look it hurts my feelings because it's wrong and I took all this time in a previous episode to explain as clearly as I could to these haters that less sharing intention more sharing action I said this yet these people these haters these mega Megatron's are bringing me down and it made me think of one of my favorite fake Chinese proverbs which is people who say it can't be done should not interrupt those who are doing it I'm doing it stop interrupting me with your negative YouTube comments that are hurting my feelings so this update is for those haters those doubters let me show you a little bit of what 3 6 8 has been up [Music] you see once the Death Star is fully up once three six eight is fully operational then almost every episode the narrative of every episode will be about three six eight doesn't mean what I'm making progress a lot of progress remember how it used to be one gigantic huge open space well now we put it in a wall to see this wall this makes this fun fun space break its own little space and what we're gonna do with this like separate room we're gonna make this room a retail space like a space that's open to the public it's not open to the public yet but it will be open to the public construction team this space will be open to the public this would be a retail store this will be an art installation space for the first first exhibition we're gonna do we're putting a tattoo artist in here and in the window you can come and watch him do tattoos closes it opens up the front space to the back space it's not something that we need or are interested also maybe hard to tell on camera but it's all a beautiful shade of white back here because we painted the entire space you might notice it's a little bit darker in here than it used to be that's because we tore out all of the track lighting so you could be tracked lights that run the entire length of this space we tore them all out we're gonna redo all the lighting that's happening that's happening now that's what this is all about and you see the investments in new hardware here we've got 265 inch cubes and then right here we have the granddaddy the biggest Hewett on the market eighty eight incher we're not a hundred percent sure where these monitors are gonna be used but I think the eighty eight incher is gonna be for our new gaming setup this is this is excited the three six eight kitchen the kitchen this is where we can have our dinners this is where we cannot creators who do like cooking channels and stuff like that coming prepare a meal for people it's being built out right now this is the countertop bar area they'll be a sink here there's gonna be a stove here a refrigerator here and then look look at this right here we already put in water we had to put water in here we had a pipe plumbing pipe with the this is water we had to put this in you know complicated that is and probably most importantly the three six eight team is being built out can't introduce them yet because there's an HR process that we have to work through but you'll know I'm soon enough sorry guys it's okay you see three six eight the idea the business it's all predicated on first having the perfect space and lower Manhattan for creators until we have that we can't really kick things off and that's what we've been focused on it's been just under two months we've made significant progress and well we're almost there that over there that's Queens that over there that's that's Manhattan I'm headed to Queens it's a lovely place I don't know if I've actually ever been there in the blog before lovely place and now I'm in Queens not entirely sure where to where to go right on Jackson Avenue left on 21st Street see as much as I love this city I seldom leave like a 10 to 15 block radius around worthy offices so this is a part of the world called Long Island City it's called Long Island City but it's it's actually Queens it's still very much so New York City but short of running the New York City Marathon which comes through here I don't think I've ever been to Long Island City before it's awesome out here alright I'm back in Manhattan let me explain what happened I was all the way out in Long Island City because my dear friend Gary Vaynerchuk who's also one my favorite people on planet Earth asked me to do something with his his company out there and of course like any excuse to work with Gary his team was amazing and they gave me directions but then I was like I was like Dorothy seeing the Emerald City for the first time Long Island City was awesome and I was like checking the place out and I was wandering around and then before I know it I got super lost and then I was trying to call his people and then my phone died and what Google Maps it would be a 20-minute trip ended up being an hour and 45 minutes and well now I gotta be home to relieve the babysitter in ten so Gary I'm sorry Gary's team a friendly sorry for just totally screwing the pooch on this one I hope hope you're not mad at me [Music] all right we are out here outside of Shake Shack it's like 10 of midnight Dan when you said later today I didn't know this is what you meant buddy I got I got a baby at home I know Grove and I just had to get

refused to try the fake meat burger dandy dan do you want to try a fake meat no ed so tonight I'm going to a different burger restaurant called Umami Burger I'm gonna tell Dan I'm getting him the best burger in the city to make up for the White Castle burger but what I'm not going to tell him what I'm not telling him is that the burger that I'm getting from Umami Burger is also a fake meat burger also called the impossible burger but it's supposed to be like the best one ever that's what everybody in the internet said so this is a big this is somewhere between a prank and an experiment on Dan mace is the place that has the burger hi I called ahead I ordered two of the impossible burgers okay see it's me this is done yeah perfect thank you I got them they're just about to close these things

this dream [Music] [Music] we got to go all the way back to New York City this is a couple days before Christmas when you're leaving town look it's not just my favorite waiting at the airport Francine loves it too [Music] the flight was pretty amazing I love Emirates Airlines but the trip was not so easy Francine is not like airplanes [Music] made it fancy I wasn't so bad but then we were there my favorite place in the world after New York City Cape Town [Music] my older kid Owen he met us there that's uh that's Cape Town there that's Lauren's head there that Signal Hill that's Nick that's Owen don't fall don't fall team two have lost one somewhere somewhere well we started together down there ran up and don't know where the kid is now when we left New York City was like cold it was yucky it was wintertime but in South Africa other side of the planet it was summer and I just wanted to be outside a lot of running been hurt a lot of running here in South Africa I love running in the heat the kid and she loves the beach I love beach we spent a lot of time at the beach [Music] the waves are huge I didn't serve not because I'm afraid of the great white or because this sign says no swimming I just remember it's on the surfboard or a wetsuit or things I need to surf with really near ZBrush absolutely then yeah we're married we don't party much for New Year's but we had a lovely dinner here at this place called La Perla and now we're going to go but on New Year's Day day 1 of 2017 Maserati the Italian supercar company they invited us to like his regatta where they had a boat so you watch the other boats that was amazed about that boat there is going from here to Rio de Janeiro in Brazil honey look at the seal hi buddy I could see how a shark can find that appetizing though right and we just look like a sausage [Music] [Music] on the way back we did some rough seas [Music] [Music] how is the boat ride Candace fine I love boat then after the boat hole the whole boat situation was over as we're leaving compliments of this kid Brad and Maserati of Cape Town they gave us a car and not just any car that's it right there that's the Maserati so the other question I have is what i'm Ziff i crash it [Music] what else what else I got a haircut I let it get way too long then on our last day there we did one of my favourite endeavor which is we took the baby to the blue frame all the kids great [Music] see mommy [Music] she loved it we had a blast there but was bent a little bit too much time and mid-race to the airport to catch up Owen people are gonna make it you got us here fast June is he gonna make the flight all these people are on the same plane so he's fine oh yeah I guess that brings us to like two hours ago bye-bye Oh [Music] the [Music] and that's it that's my whole trip to Cape Town I left Canada so I'm not flying back to New York I'm getting out a plane now I'm flying directly to [Music]", "label": "G"}, {"data": "Christmas no not per Casey nice that so perfect you Casey that's me thank you thank you very much I know what's in this box but to make this scene really climactic and dramatic I'm gonna pretend I have no idea what's in this box that might be wrong I didn't know I'm pretty sure I'm right I'm pretty sure I know exactly what's in this box to the ISTEP family season's greetings from your friends at Emirates Airline oh you guys know where I'm going with this one hey that's pretty nice [Music] I don't want this to come across as ingrateful at all Emirates but this whole premeditated scene would have been much more climactic if my actual plane ticket had been in this package no big deal though in the absence of come on panasonic just focus just but the absence of the ticket I can just explain to you what happened or what's going on like a year ago I flew into Emirates from here to Australia or something like that and they gave me a free upgrade on a ticket that I paid for like I paid for this ticket I mean I didn't pay for it the company that was flying me to anyway this ticket was paid for but they gave me a free upgrade to first-class I made a video about sitting in the first-class seat which I'm sure you've seen sits done 47 48 47 million views cut - a few weeks ago ICM Business Insider that Emirates has this new plane with an even sweeter first class I want to fly in that plane now look there is a good argument that just because I made a video once and just because I harassed them on Twitter I'm not entitled to a free airplane ticket I agree I happen to be going back to Dubai for work this week so like all the moons kind of aligned I got in touch they got in touch with me via Twitter and they're like yeah we can make it happen so I will be flying on that ridiculous new first-class cabin very very soon there's another tiny caveat here which is that that plane doesn't actually fly from New York to Dubai so I'm gonna go all the way out of our way to go to Brussels on my way to Dubai just so I can fly this new airplane just so I can make a video about it this is very exciting for me [Music] [Music] [Music] y'all black suitcases look exactly the same you gotta do something to differentiate excuse this non-sequitur but before I embark on my voyage I want to talk about YouTube for a minute the question I had asked more than anything else about YouTube is how do I make a successful YouTube channel there is a very simple a very simple answer to that do something nobody else is doing and do it really well but that's a hard answer to hear because even though that's simple in concept and execution that is maybe the hardest thing there is to do and it's for that reason that I appreciate creators like like david dobrik who introduced like an entirely new genre to the the comedy space on youtube or like my friend peter McKinnon who introduced like a different production style to vlogging every once in a while there's a unicorn that is someone I see on YouTube who just like blows my mind a creator doing something that is so new so fresh that like it makes me question my own creativity because it's not just a new take on an existing genre it's not just doing the same thing other people are doing but better it's it's completely new from every perspective so this is me talking about my new favorite youtuber her name's Ellie the mill as an amber channel but she is someone who I think is pushing the boundaries of YouTube creating content that's just brilliant like really not just complicated but very well done productions but like really intimate and intricate and brilliant narratives and subject matter including like some of our more silly videos that are just sort of like jokes or pranks the complexity and depth with which she approaches even that kind of content is something that there is like not a lot of on this platform now when I try to think of what it is that makes a creator like Elle so special it really begins with the way she's able to authentically be herself on camera I feel like the person I see on screen is the person that I might know in real life that's the kind of thing that seems really really easy there are very very few youtubers who can do that well including me I struggle being on camera the person that the person that I am in real life being yourself well hard is one of the things that you can do on YouTube to really differentiate your content from other people's people don't always copy your style or your look but they can never copy you being yourself sounds like it's an obvious thing to do on the platform but it's not and it's hard you see other people other creators that are successful you want to emulate them and you end up you end up putting on a facade of who you are end up thank you you end up coming across as disingenuous something you're not so now if you see this video keep up the great work you everyone a collab let me know I just fly up to Canada and hang out with you or maybe you want to come to New York City we could do something interesting together big fan here [Music]", "label": "G"}, {"data": "Hilary Clinton I will be voting for Hillary Clinton I avoid talking politics on this channel on this forum because politics are divisive there's always two sides Republicans and Democrats there's left and there's right I can have my opinion and there will always be an opposing one that is the nature of a healthy democracy but this is not that this is about a megalomaniac who's driven by nothing but ego a man who cares exactly zero about the people of this country a person who brags about sexually assaulting women and shames others for the way they look I'm speaking up now because this election has very little to do with politics policy or legislation this has to do with morals and principles I'm voting for Hillary because make no mistake there is only one person that can defeat him one person that can keep him away from power and it is her I'm not a huge fan of her stale politics I'm entirely aware of all the criticism against her I'm aware of all of her failures and shortcomings but she's intelligent and she knows what she's doing more importantly she's mentally sound she's responsible and she's saying I want to end this by calling out all the big youtubers some I know and some you viewers might know see making videos like this they're not popular they're not going to get you subscribers they're not gonna boost your view counts but there is something much more valuable than subscribers or dollars and that's backbone that is not being scared to stand up for what is right regardless of the costs the top 20 youtubers reach over a billion views every single week every seven days we have the power to activate a demographic an electorate that isn't typically very active that is young people you see this generation if we're all banded together we have the power to ensure that this tax avoiding lying racist misogynist stays away from power and out of the White House but it requires all of us coming together so if your favorite youtuber says things like I don't like to talk politics on my channel or I'm not going to reveal who I'm voting for call them out sitting on the sidelines this time around is not okay this election is different and if this guy gets elected and you stood back with your arms folded and

convention center here where I'm going to be doing my talk it is so humid out right now that the lens is all blurry this is just gonna have to be the soft focus episode there are a lot of questions in the comments yesterday about what are these talks that i do how do i do then why do i do then what do I talked about yesterday in brazil i was talking about online marketing in and mainstream traditional media versus new media today's event called and econ here in Colombia is much more of a business industry event where they're talking about what they're talking about information technologies and everything in between they invite me to these things because my background in in television and then feature films and then in journalism and then in technology and all of these different trajectories of my career is taking me on has provided me with a perspective that the kinds of people that attend these events want to hear from honor of being invited to these like great events prior to travel to like exotic countries and I come here and I connect with like a huge audience and speak them about all kinds of stuff question that I saw like a thousand times was do i get paid for these well yes and no for academic lectures like last year I spoke at Yale and i was invited to speak at Harvard this year and then I spoke at MIT to students in their mba program those kinds of things like no I don't get I don't get paid for those sorts of things but ones that are more for-profit ones that people actually pay admission to sometimes I do get paid and that's amazing but all of them almost without exception always pay for my travel and help me get there so it really is like an awesome excuse to travel and then when i get to wherever I'm going it's a great way to engage with like people from the other side of the planet who are doing something similar to what i do that's what today is about to change anything it's almost time i get my present alive yes is that many have nobody solution we're gonna be some press interviews now we're almost done because i wasn't called casein and stuff thank you for filming thank you guys hoping well ready where she came to the

City how many episodes this week have ended with me going to sleep on an airplane still on my run but there's this somewhat without described as an unprotected hole in the running path here this whole that's like 10 feet okay just uh just something to remember watch out for the holes", "label": "G"}, {"data": "[Music] thank you very much all right back at the airport again okay very very exciting episode of three six eight coming out to you today today I'm going to be doing a collaboration with one of my favorite youtubers a guy named marques Brownlee we're shooting that collab in a different city than New York's we have to fly there and to fly there we're going to be taking a private jet and no the title is not clickbait this private jet costs us exactly two hundred and ninety nine dollars to fly us from New York City to Florida I'll explain two hundred and ninety-nine dollars how did this happen for $299 it's a little complicated but but when they need to move a plane like this plane was here in New York City they need to move it to Florida they were just gonna fly an empty plane that's called an empty leg and if you're in the right place and the right time you can actually get one of those empty legs so they were moving this plane and we are like cargo and that $299 is just to cover the cleaning fee for the plane and it just so happened that we need to go to Florida to shoot a movie on the same day that they needed to move a plane to Florida so we get it for two hundred ninety nine months right Marquez kind of worked out that way didn't it it's pretty good have you ever private planes I've never once in my life muggins n on a private jet and now we're a fly on a scale of one are you feeling this is like a 17 even right now we're in Florida those are cars I believe so did you organize that kinda yeah I'm going to the minibar I'm down here as kind of Marquez's what second unit camera man we're square team today we're team today yeah Marquez here making a video for his series called autofocus kind of a plan words Auto being a car focus of the video of being on the car and he's here today to make a video about a car and I told them that I would come and handle all the aerial cinematography cuz that is my forte is that pretty accurate that's pretty good so we're a bunch of shots it's just gonna be a fun video be fun good old-fashioned good old-fashioned fun video today yeah so the reason why the way to come all the way to Florida to get the car that marques is making a video about is because he needed a Lamborghini and of course and I guess this is where like the best Lamborghini dealership is for this place now I don't trust myself enough to drive in a Lamborghini so I went ahead and rented this here minivan it's a fine minivan yeah now marques is going to get into that lime green Lambo right there and we're going to go to location we're going to shoot is he gonna drive that's not up to me the real question is will he be able to keep up with my minivan no chance hey director what's happening we're a position in the car and we're gonna start getting some b-roll start shooting this thing I have told your Lamborghini I'm gonna ride this skateboard not that behind the scenes is an interesting but they're just getting b-roll I'm gonna go check out Palm Beach look at this house now I don't know a lot about Palm Beach but I do know that all of these houses have just fantastic hedges look at this looks like minecraft camera fell over what are you gonna what are you gonna drive this thing marques hopefully sooner Eggbert we're trying to get as many shots now still before we am angry these people and rev the engine a lot and then leave this car looks tiny next to you marques you look twice the size of this car this is just this is just to get audio we're in a neighborhood right now am I the only one that feels back to the neighbors doing some some rolling shots here so let me get this straight you're sitting sideways and your legs are tangled this is the safety yeah you guys are doing great everybody's doing great so there's a small crack there Marquez what exactly happened look okay you're going over we're going over a golf course fairway there's no one golfing we're just going down the middle of the fairway and we just send the drone down the middle the fairway you know how there's trees on the one side trees on the other side yeah kind of round around behind so we're setting it down the middle of a fairway and I'm like yeah we're good we're good coming up on one of these trees back here but don't worry about that just stay on the mobile fairway and then suddenly it hits that tree so clearly my depth perception was a little yes a depth perception issue so yeah not partial is generous part yeah yeah you know what this one's on me all right [Music] [Music] alright guys I will see you back in New York in New Jersey I'll see you on the Internet when is the video of the end alive give it a couple days give it a couple days all right those guys are actually staying til tomorrow due to more production but I idiot back I see the family [Music]", "label": "G"}, {"data": "[Music] it's 6:30 in the morning Brett this house in Marfa Texas everybody's asleep except for me and Daniel here we're up so we can go for a quick run before we start the day getting ready to push off now it saves me a long day of location scouting this is like honestly what is that day I mean they say it's a mass but it looks more like that so we're right here this is Mexico yeah this interest is all women the road now I can remember were and this was the road like the Halloween Havoc up turn hours really this is so now we're on the dirt road the next stop is the Mexican border of the Rio Grande but what we're doing here today is we're doing more location scouting for Max's movie max made do what you can with me earlier this year now I'm helping him with his doing you can't movie it sort of begins with a crazy idea where we need a long stretch of road and today's location scouting is to find that perfect long stretch of road I don't think that's [Music] I know this topic about but furthering reconnaissance here let's go find it okay I must be really rusty am i drowning or something so I can't find new york city anymore i haven't been in the blogs much I've crashed it three times today and I just crashed into a telephone wire any sign of it village it's gotta be around here in this rock formation I think is what we do there's got to be there what that means boom boom it's right there you buy that I mean seems fine just broke its leg this broke off aggressively I guarantee you this thing still works should not explain the whole idea for Max's movie the requires shooting out of the window of a cause it's moving at a certain speed to capture you guys going to test it with the stabilizer here they come is there using the stabilizer to see if they can get a stable shot of the window of this car traveling at that speed I mean that's where it in the animation is playing in here right that's pretty smooth it's pretty smooth yeah you can't tell that especially if that's not like that's not the best stabilizer either right if this is not the best one it's not that we're getting Travis okay this room is not going to work it's now long enough stretch and it's not too bumpy you gotta slow down a little big question uh-huh gas station about three hours away I give this road like a be mine okay and what do you what's acceptable B plus a month we call all-weather markup syrup yet I have to join from hell touch him right by the neck bite the head off so what's up a fake oh my god Karen open this idea that may be closer to the border there'll be a more like open road that's more interesting looking so we're headed to the border of Texas and Mexico [Music] so not a hundred percent as to where we are but we're definitely right at or right near the border Mexico Texas we're not going to Mexico a guy we just met at a bar the most remote bar in all of Texas according to him is taking us 200 feet this way to the Mexican American border there's no law enforcement here keith is the only law enforcement is that water escort cartel but he says that would no sense of irony before such spasm the river is over there behind that tree so where's Mexico that's Mexico sit the tree with limbs off of it let's make showing this out of the Texas Mexico Texas Mexico Mexico call text browsing its mobile plan are we in Mexico look like going to use it's on candy that better right there yeah bring the tech waited every day morning fun where's the warning sign right here now you do have to say that it says warning allele the care farm in New Mexico oh wait we can't but we can't do think oh dude I already got a references turn out yet remember football you let you far turn around pull why did you take us all the way down here can we turn around here it's a double yellow I'm a tall up there we're here because you can't go any further south and the Continental why Mexico why is that important why is that relevant here move it the whole idea is that the road we're going to pick a road that's going to tell us a story and the only way we can see that story is by traveling around is traveling on that road and the story that that road is going to tell us is about where it is in the world and this this road that's right here basically on the us-mexico border has a lot of stories to tell good bad drugs immigration buffalo soldiers Pancho via there's I mean pick your poison there are a million things that happen on these roads right here in this part of America and like I think they have something to tell [Music] back there like Border Patrol's here we go next why are you filming um I got a guy got to get this at all cost I'll pass where you'll like me I'm not insured miss party is Daniel his lights aren't on yet back off take the blade prong angled over I have no I had no idea pass out though for stopping speed sir something off brown yeah hi guys super friendly police officer here give us a warning but there's one small problem with the

helping us writing this is Max Vidya Max's video and I'm this kind of like this is a big movie where max can have done in two months the goal is to make it like Max's do what you can't story like his

running in California hey gotta get out of this hotel room right now I have a special guest to the blog today my sister Jordan I'm meeting her for lunch and you know I don't get to see my sister that often so I'm pretty excited about this [Music] this morning I just need to get my car I don't remember what kind of car it is but it's either the Rolls Royce of the test no hi that's it that's it all right I'm on my way to visit my big sister 10-14 Wilshire and here's the thing about my sister she's the nicest human being on planet Earth but she gets super super upset if you make her wait which is totally fair you should never make someone wait but on 6 minutes late [Music] just get up find the girl sorry when Joey's just finished lunch this is my sister you might remember from other vlogs [Music] my sister works for some company that sells something for athletes do you want to pitch it to my vlog yours hotshot is for muscle cramps you guys should try it it's great Casey loves it because it's spicy that is not that's an unpaid unpaid endorsement for my sister Jordan [Music] all right this is the famous Venice Beach you might recognize it from Grand Theft Auto I'm here in California for work I have a shoot later today but it's a shoot where I'm like an actor I'm like a character I'm like in it I'm not shooting and I'm not directing it I'm just in it and I can't talk about what it is but it's something fun and awesome and cool that you'll see soon enough but I've got a little bit of time to kill and I thought this would be a good time to finally test out the GoPro karma drone I didn't bring my mavet because I drop it in the river but I have my phantom 4 so I'm gonna test them head-to-head all right here we go ahh surprised to see you here what are you doing in Venice man I was just something told me to be here today I got the Phantom 4 and I got the Karma Karma's a virgin it's never been flown before I want to do the same exact shot with the Phantom 4 and then the same exact shot with the Karma are we gonna race by the way the drone Ferg's you've seen already in today's vlog was on the DJI not on the Karma [Music] this fandom that flown a thousand times and completely fluent with it the GoPro I've only flown once and it was under the supervision of GoPro first time I'm ever putting a first time I'm ever putting drone blades on the Karma so it has a black part on the top and a silver part guys karma is the same process as on the DJI so far I'm gonna fly the DJI first because I just know how to do it and there's less question marks we've never flown a DJI before the controller is pretty good it works really well do you know what like the rules are we allowed to fly drones down here I've no idea probably nothing okay so here you be cameraman man [Music] the shot I'm gonna do is straight out the beach over the rocks over the surfers and back landing the phantom took some practice I'm very very good at it like a box without having really flown it this controller is incredible look at that no phone your nothing big fat screen but if it doesn't work as well it doesn't matter but it is nice feel that pretty slow to boot up shoot cuz I haven't done this before I'm about to set it up here we go ready to start Wow okay incredible stop that was very fast and efficient nice work GoPro here we go moment of truth here ready for takeoff throw let's do this [Music] take off was a breeze nice work GoPro all right now I'm gonna turn shoot you know what I didn't that recording I wasn't recording scene you okay take two I'm actually rolling this time this is gonna be my first landing ever with a GoPro Karma [Music] Oh big violence not bad okay that was not using an automatic land feature that was just me crash landing up enough oh wait look we're missing a blade that's enough good how did this get over here it's hard this is not a conclusive review but so far very impressed here's what the footage looks like [Music] [Music] [Music] purely from an image quality perspective I do think that GoPro is a better picture than the Phantom for the DJI flies better it's easier to control the software is better but but in the head-to-head just on image quality I give it to go pro all around though I do think that the Phantom 4 is too superior for so I haven't seen Jerome here in a long time and I convinced him to come with me but we had the complete opposite direction of his house and now I have to drop him off somewhere so you can get an uber I could thug you don't help any more on this side I can't drive home Robin and this my huge so I'm literally just having to kick him out like I'm sorry I feel like a terrible friend right now from drama just leave you here with that thank you thank you for that name you know good to see you soon yes keep your hands off that girl Jerome you don't know her won't you up together all right good luck at home I hope you don't get kidnapped by Jerome okay look at this place it looks like I'm in the city right this is not a city this is a god this is a Hollywood backlot none of these buildings are real like looking this looks like like that no what would you call this this is like the school right right here not a school there's nothing in here at all lost my skateboard this isn't a bank right here and that's not a country store back there and that's not a liquor store and that's not a restaurant so this do you hear that my camera focus is off this is the back lot where the shoot that I'm here for was shot very cool production though I've never had such free reign of a backlog I brought my skateboard not as cool as you'd think but look looks like concrete listen hollow nothing's real whiskey in the liquor store not a liquor store at all to be a great place to have a party or film a skateboard video or I really was not planning on staying in Los Angeles tonight you see I was going to fly out tonight I didn't book a flight in there when I went to book a flight it was like so I'm in LA for one more day one more night one more day I'm gonna book my flight out right now check out who I found in Los Angeles it's Oscar hey hey all right have fun

sitting on my ass wishing for death I just wanted to fill you guys in on the state of this channel you know where it's headed where it's going the graveyard getting a job as a janitor again at the local high school while I was away I made three jontron videos and obviously they're not here because I didn't release them and each time I make one I was just kind of like how that's not right that's not right and I just had to kind of stop and ask okay why why am I feeling that way basically I've been doing this format for like six or seven years now and I know it's not always consistent but but I think at the moment for me it's a bit too narrow and I just want to do more things and jontron tends to be I know it may not look like it but it tends to be really time-consuming it's expensive to make requires a lot of coordination and it sort of ends up getting in the way of other things that I want to do so I'm not going anywhere but I'm letting you know I will be breaking away from that formula a little bit and I'll just be sort of doing things that I think are funny and hopefully you'll think they're funny please please PLEASE ultimately I just want to keep you guys entertained because if I don't then it's all pointless and I figure if I'm having more fun with everything you guys will probably enjoy it more - tends to be how it works so just kind of bear with me during this transitional period I mean what what if I I've only had nearly a year to sort this out what you looking at me for but in the meantime I do have way more jontron video to tide you over with us you can

entire day wrestling to get this camera to work but look good though this is a 4k vlog today for a very special reason for k because yesterday's episode about the new DJ I Matic Pro drone was very popular but a lot of people had a lot of questions about the imagery that this thing yields versus the imagery that this thing yield so long story long I thought I'd shoot today in 4k that way i can put the 4k image from these suckers in there like in its raw pure State I just been looking at camera setup camera that's a canon 5d mark for and then I got this monitor down here to see all this monitors their microphones there however to get this thing to work if you're not John Olson just ignore this next part John how do you possibly shoot your daily videos in 4k everyday how is this not just a huge pain in the act of the number one piece of criticism i was getting yesterday automatic pro that's the tiny girl lets that's this guy was that the image seem soft oh yeah the image may have been soft because i had to adjust the resolution of it to match yesterday's episode which is why today's important by the way if you click the little car right there and they all way up here to 4k you can see this video and all its glory you're going to want to have a really good internet connection if you do that otherwise it's gonna like glitch and buffer and all that bullshit now before i take these drugs out for a side-by-side comparison i want to sort of get into my my entire thesis and understanding behind drone quality first since this is the underlying theme of why I'm going there in the first place okay I hear y-axis here the marker the tip just falls out of this marker and then look at my fingers your x-axis here this is convenience practicality of use penny asked super-convenient x-axis here is the quality of the image this is the best quality you could ever ask for their boat a toe now ideally what you're looking for in any piece of hardware is fertile in this sweet spot here that means both super convenient and very high quality for you longtime viewers of the blog remember to supply this right this is a parent drone it's closer to a toy than a drone pretty low quality image but really easy to keeping your backpack so this little drone is super convenient but very very low-quality DJI inspire maybe you've seen this thing before this monstrous drone that like has moving arms like a space alien my friend jesse has one so the quality is over here but it's not to be at all in fact it's acute pain you know that exists here which brings us to this thing the phantom 4 up until yesterday my favorite drug on the market convenient and very high quality right about here the quality is almost the pretty convenient and then comes the Matic Pro is not a qualitatively as the p4 i would say it's right here but it's convenient is up here the ideal piece of equipment lives here the reason why i love this thing is because it lives right here good enough quality and very convenient any day of the week i'll trade a tiny bit of quality to get the shot leaving for traffic on my skateboard looks like in for the better okay I'm down here under the Williamsburg Bridge to do a comprehensive analysis between the phantom 4 and the DJI Matic Pro I also brought the parent whatever plastic thrown just as a control study number one backpack sighs this is the DJI gained from for backpack as you can see it's a fairly large pack this big bag is necessary to carry the drone down here you got your controller propellers etc next up is the Matic Pro the Maverick fits in this lovely satchel i wish this satchel came in cheetah print or maybe a hot pink in this little satchel fit the controller and then the drone itself last compares the parrot drone not an official bag but the drone itself and then the propellers which I keep in this carrying case this thing is a pretty serious commitment this thing is worthless on the Waimea part of this video you could take this out of date you can take this to the roller skating rink you could take this to the dairy products for the travel with ok now the moment of truth i'm going to apply each of the three drones on the same route for a side-by-side comparison ok first not preventing for I really really wish I picked today that wasn't like a stormy like horrible kill force winds but already started this okay here we go another grow yeah this is the parent i'll just tell you right now i'm going to want a hundred percent lose this the window tickets gonna fly away yeah get them off god this thing is a nightmare it's like 10 feet of water lost connection which is what always happens and then it's just SAT there and then it flew back here and then it wouldn't land looking at the Phantom footage right next to the mattock footage the magic is a much softer make like less sharp unless it's a much softer image than the Phantom for the phantom 4 is a superior camera the gap is big but not overwhelming but it is a superior camera but when you're talking about the idea of either carrying this to capture that perfect image or carrying just this get an image that's good but not great for someone like me who a youtuber I make the video everyday convenience is a super huge priority so I'm going to stick with this but all of you commenters were totally right the natick does have a softer less sharp image then the big but if we're gonna forgive her back to wear today began i still think convenience over here is just as important as quality over here so i will trade this little bit of quality for this huge amount of convenience oh and the bebop drone this thing I just put that in there to show you what a drone of comparable size the natick actually looks like and the last thing to say is i wish i had a GoPro karma are so frustrating that i don't i would love to show you what that looks like because i don't have a GoPro karma yet they just lonely one for one day to give it back they do have this this is the session 5 in 4k the new session that's not out yet I kind of took it from him and didn't give it back but this is the exact camera that will be on the Karma to give you ideas like what the karma is going to look like that's a pretty good image here all pretend I'm a drone that's the best i could do that was shot on this little day for Kerry pretty pretty good pretty good GoPro okay i hope this was helpful just thinking I had three drones in my back and then i have this camera which is a 5d mark for its expensive there would be a terrible terrible day to get robbed unless you're the robber to be a great day to Rodney how's that doesn't happen", "label": "G"}, {"data": "[Music] I've had this stomach ache that has been like ah fierce like crippling the old man thinks it could be an appendicitis like where they have to cut out your appendix good job do I hope it's not bad yeah I'm not looking forward to this at all well Stanley what should we do George going to hospital that we have to go now yes well I'm outside the hospital now out of triage is that 45-minute wait before they give me a proper inspection you know I don't feel sick I don't feel like there's anything wrong with me but Candace's dad is like an expert doctor so if he says I need to cover the hospital so I have a really severe pain right here okay [Music] all right she's worried about my appendix but wants to make sure it's not like that some sort of infection okay yeah I think that's my bed you seem fine to me your dad said it's a 70% chance that it's a problem yeah I've got huge veins yeah you do I hate that feeling man that's like getting a needle shoved under your skin and into your arm that's what it feels like but seriously how do you think I'm doing you're such a baby I felt bad for you when you're in pain last night I don't feel bad for when you complain about my new tattoo [Music] [Music] so the CT scans done now I don't know we just I think now they just like look to see what's happening inside of my body to make the determination as to whether or not it actually is like an appendicitis or something else so in any event it is now 1:00 in the morning Candice and her father left at like 10:30 they moved me from the emergency room up into this private room which is lovely it's very nice up here I've got a television and a window and now it's just the waiting game so I think I just like sleep or do whatever you do in a hospital until 8:00 a.m. okay I'll see you then all right nothing I did I just get to come home they said they said I'm a prime candidate for no operation 7:00 in the morning 703 in the morning I slept like a baby last night I make him sleep anywhere I slept particularly well in this hospital last night so before I went to bed they put me on antibiotics that's what this whole business and this whole business is about and they said the antibiotics might actually fix the problem this morning the residents the doctors here they said if I'd woken up and like was in much more pain than I was in last night that then I should get the surgery but because I don't have more pain than I had last night that I'm probably good which is like tremendous news so right now I'm just kind of chilling and I'm waiting for the attending physician to come give me his opinion but yeah I think I just got a night in the hospital I got some great antibiotics no surgery and that's where I'm at right now Thank You doctors okay huge news this story is over I'm waiting for my pills and then we get to go home the family's back that's my surgery story all right goodbye hospital thank you all of the doctors and nurses for keeping me healthy how does it shity 12 hours [Music]", "label": "G"}, {"data": "that's the DJI spark we got tiny it is look how tiny is also this is it this is the DJI spark I wish there the way I could show you just how small it is [Music] anything that doesn't do it justice you have to hold the senior hand it is fantastically small remember how small the Mavic was when you first saw it this thing is miniscule its tiny it is smaller than the old tiny iPhone this is my red jacket pocket phantom for spark look at this look at this could easily carry this around this is the 747 this is the space shuttle that flies on top of it all right now it's time to get out of the studio and do an actual performance test of this early version of the spark there is one small problem with testing us though and that is that I'm under investigation by the FAA and I can't fly in New York City anymore so I don't want to get in trouble and if you're responsible and you shouldn't do it either so I got to go somewhere where I can fly this thing safely boosted board is out of range I'm going to need a better vehicle to get out of the city to shoot this video can I borrow swing do you have a car I can borrow that matches my jacket this one is that like the 458 Spyder has a slightly better reign is just a little bit quicker than the skateboard so I'm headed out of the city now I just need I'm going to go meet a friend who can help me with the tech aspect of this video review [Music] we'll mark it slowly with a deck review I'm gonna help you out yeah all right let's go oh god I don't know how to lock okay Marquez just like everybody else on planet earth has never seen the tiny DJI spark before tiny like time you like Mavic is pretty matted that's smaller than your smallest cell phone that that's a bomb that's the smallest drone box that's an okay slide open Marco's right oh you did not lie did not why is that Wow all right some very important disclosures before I fly this thing for the first time number one this is not a paid review number two they were very specific this is a prototype this is not the final one the ones they ship is going to be more perfected than this number they don't actually have a controller ready yet so I'm we can filling this with my cell phone and see this is not a complete review this is just a first look to see what this thing is like because this is unfinished to hardware and software let's fly it do it alright here we go take off oh why nothing is super super steady I mean it's wobbling but the shock steady that's like saying foot you never get this close to any other drum [Music] the controls even just using a cell phone are really really responsive it's just like flying a regular big Mavic or phantom but instead of having physical buttons you're using the touchscreen some other things it always use 1080 not 4k it has a two axis gimbal not a 3 axis gimbal which means it goes up down and it stabilizes the rotation axis got it like this but it doesn't do this right it doesn't turn brave man I'm a trusting that it's cable right yeah rock-solid and there's a little bit of grief this is the scene in the test where I'm going to be pitting the tiny spark again see slightly larger Mavic we're going to use the Ferrari as the subject [Music] I think it's early around five six hundred bucks its marketed for people to take tip photos of friends and stuff like that not like a hardcore little lesson of film tool but more of a fun tool exactly like it's meant for people who've never own drum it's unbelievably impressive I'm not being paid to say that but I give it a fat thumbs up not being paid to say anything either but I'll have a more detailed comparison I yes and definitely is that a plug for your channel oh you should go check out go check out marques channel links alone that's it okay that's it but seriously DJ

the Oscar goes to Argo I don't know how that happened but I still think he's a Bede's a great filmmaker good actor great uh-oh what's taking so long buddy now because the Owen is 50% of my genetic makeup his favorite place in the city is also juice press that's so much stuff did you get a spoon the movie starts in three minutes do you remember where we live right there that apartment was awesome I used to live in this building right here and then I gave it to a good friend of mine he moved in and a week later the apartment burned down his dog died in the fire very very sad I'm gonna put this away now last time they like came into the theater and they thought I was trying to like film the screen and boo liked the movie so I'd be a little bit more discreet from now on hasn't started yet we expected a trusted director stolen cash he's capable of coming in cold undercooking years of books getting out alive go here's the thing it had all the makings to be like an a homerun action flick but the Edit was not good like it was too slow the movie was a little slow honestly like if I had four hours and iMovie I think I could have taken that movie from like C plus to an A - it was still a C+ alright Ben Affleck oh good cast Owens in an uber I'm skateboarding humps it's faster I really want to see Francine before she goes to bed [Music] she's still away [Music]", "label":

that's called a switchblade come pitch me your movies I don't know what we're making I can't okay the idea is ever since the first day I arrived in US are we wearing the same outfit every damned so the first the first time I saw you unboxing something and then and then I saw a camera falling and the way that you interact with it and then us I saw the drone symmetry and all these broken bits and pieces I was like imagine the gear had feelings what they would feel like okay and then I was like maybe I should make a movie about how the gear feels to be treated the way that it does and then I was like maybe it's larger than that and maybe they behave a certain way because because they they want something from you and then I brought in Danny who's an animator and together we've kind of made this this foam about like breaking down the reasons why you treat your gear completely differently to anyone else and I think we found out why and that's kind of what the film is okay I'm excited it's nice it's like it's a mystery movie but there's a lot of realism like when you watch it you like maybe that could be I do keep all of my old broken gear see this here this is the drone cemeteries all my broken all of these cameras here are indeed broken all of these camera boxes are from season one of the vlog that's what's what what are these monitors here oh so this is outside this is outside

straight 7.17 miles in there to 720 per mile piece this is friend teens almost work i'm back on that raw organic vegan smoothie tip erase the only raw organic vegan smoothies have a like a Google Alert setup so anytime my name shows up in the news or any like pump online publications I get an email here is like surprise often like I make a video or what I've lost anything i just like to know whatever my name is so this morning i get this bonkers email and there's like there's like a hundred different news outlets have written about my airplane movie i haven't had a movie go viral like this since probably since the snowboard video bc mr. Bourne movie this is like a nine-minute vlog that's done 10 million views that's insane okay in any event why am i bringing this up because there's one article here its input it's a publication called the gothamist which is like a big New York City blog right here's here's the part that I like it says recently professional fun hammer Casey nice tat professional fund our greatest title ever Casey nice that and then here's the part that makes me look AKA real-life pucci now look I make a living by sharing my life in the form of videos on the internet being called names is not something that is new to me but I've never been called pucci so I look up what Pucci is I think he needs a little more oh yeah there it is right there i am the real life pucci hold on ready somebody I don't always wear a backwards hat i just have really curly hair and if i take a shower like I do in the airplane and where it hadn't started doing something that's like a little bit stupid and a lot a bit risky it goes it goes like this ready take my boosted board and then i take this bike lock wrapped around the pole and then lock it through my truck just like that so it's locked the trucks there and then this is locked here and then just sort of leaning up against like that it's risky and stupid because that's really expensive in this isn't super safe but for like five minutes you so much easier than carrying a heavy heavy boosted were around a lot to all your videos you do a great job is to take one I thought I should be about your video you don't breach of you see my wife in here you see my wife teachers at school said Francine moms playing with water but they need more shirts for her this is where can despise baby shirt just fine we have like a photo shoot with the cousins this is all you I don't know any keep up the good work and like watch all your videos through here alright I'll see you around look up look it's still there it held where the coca-cola dress choose me and then and then I'll go back to the office but you don't like these faxes don't have the ones that I want my size I like these but they don't they don't have min 11 that's good right Bhayani you enter i try i don't always succeed but I try like take a half an hour out of every day to spend with a girl like out of the office doing something try to keep that relationship keep that marriage on the level you know yeah this is my main camera great camera mmm good camera its weakest link is this right here this mini jack always fries in fact i have to show you i'ma show you what i have i have one two three four and five oh ok for and all of these have the same issue microphone jack broken i think there is a very good argument there to say it's completely my fault that the microphone jacks broken because I half the time I put the camera down put it down like this not cool this little clip here is meant for attaching a camera strap but i think i think that i can use that to attach a piece of wood and make like a protector for this the Japanese pole saws more precise of a tool than this you see the trouble is after navigate around all the precision movement and it can't get in the way the screens ability to pivot so it's like a very specific size piece of wood here this fit is absolutely magical trying it handled a lot so gonna definitely want soft edges on this no do it we do out there man is that you're vlogging camera wireless well what is that this is a red it's just like your camera to shoot a little bigger to look at your food thank you sir i love this building just all people making stuff alright this is the this is the sketchy part given this a lot of thought and I really think drilling into this camera would be a bad idea so I'm going to glue it thermal adhesive hot glue the only one that it's pretty forgiving one time i use an image similar to this is my thumbnail and everybody thought I was like smoking crack or something get in that crack get about four seconds before this fully cure so okay thus concludes the arts and crafts portion of today's episode it never touches the cable i'm going home we're putting the baby in the stroller and we're taking her for a walk is tonight as well tonight's special good job Francine yeah you're the best scooter please job Candice you know the reason why we had to come out tonight is the last day of summer officially officially for me you know if you go back 365 episodes that you'll find me saying this one year ago today but for me the ear always ends when the summer ends at the time do you want to get the most bummed out and weird existential your night but it's also when we get the prettiest sunsets I get a lot of these requests it's impossible for me to address all of them because they've got a friend who watches

of weird people emailing me weird things all the time but in the summer 2012 some total stranger emailed me and was like hey I work in the White House would you like to come down and go bowling and have pizza and beer in the basement of the White House to which I responded in enthusiastic but I'll write in our final station song you're just a ship Washington so yeah so we took the train to the White House met a group of strangers went into the White House and that's how we're bowling we're in route to the White House now not super excited about the way my collar fits this corner is where we're supposed to be meeting the folks that are taking it to the White House whom we've never met before I don't know what they look like our time in trouble was owing if he didn't have his

me at the end of the day I filmed everything he was like please don't put any of this on the internet and I was like what why no this is like gold he's like okay don't put this on the internet so long as Barack Obama is our president when Donald Trump was sworn into office last week it meant that I could finally release just kind of not even back to the video but it's bowling in the White House oh my god I do it in the right mazie [Music] so when I say when they see basement of the lighthouse they literally amazement this is the basement and this is a bowling alley two lanes here classical

beat yeah yeah what are you doing today Candis yeah I sorry the audio is messed up i broke my microphone like two seconds ago this is the romantic vacation honeymoon was that trip this is the recap

love it yeah yeah yeah yeah where's the park having like keep order in the park having like a family picnic and there's this couple over there and like the guy's hands at the girl's skirt and she keeps like lifting your dress shopping pcr entire she's like wearing a long it's wildly inappropriate all kids and families around here and then these two and this has come here at the bar you love Backstreet Boys our room and the boat was tiny but totally fine perfectly adequate yeah that was awesome they make your own pajamas here monday mr. nice that Candace's say Candace why don't you think they put your last name on yours okay you're confused my name is Candice pool they didn't want to offend me by saying this is a nice data files like some feminists that now my name is but little did I know it's just some too lazy and the people that are on this motor like mostly middle-aged no related right retired people we were on the younger side of the people on this boat remember the dance party but then we had all this trouble in the airport that ultimately ended with us getting to Venice and having no luggage whatsoever all of our suitcases were missing we will be in two places one will be in control gear TR 0 gie are very soon as they find her back sending them to the airport tomorrow and they're gonna drive into the boat will help me tomorrow I think so let's go yeah I'm just relieved they have that I'm going that's like fifty percent of the day two of the holiday we're in I don't know how to say somewhere in Croatia lovely here still don't have our bags but rumor has it we're going to have them tomorrow which is tremendously excited I was kind of excited about buying more ski club that it was just inviting the cheapest as at least expensive clothing we can find to keep ourselves dress look at this mannequin with something seemed trying to strange with her we just got some crucial information they found one of our bags as in either canvases bag for my bag if it's candice is back i'm going to be very upset but happy for you with we're in croatia in with this town called dr. Baccio this is code for that right yeah a woman came up to candace and said Candace your luggage and I think she meant luggage oh my god there it is is it again this is what we just remember there was a there it is guys and we also with that's good for another couple . i can and thus concludes the luggage saga yeah yeah letter thank you the boat would stop somewhere like everyday regular cruise you could go to the town that you stopped in or you can stand the boat if you stay on the boat my favorite thing to do is you they let you swim off of the back of the boat which was awesome yeah yeah yeah yeah cold out here great oh and one time we rented a boat remember about that was the SS 420 no joke HP 420 check her out for tiring you know how to drive working yeah you know huh nice day thank you

trip we've been on since the baby was born and it was great anything else you want to add this because you haven't really contributed much Candace I love it won't be able to buy time see when you get old and you have kids it's really hard to get away because that's when you watch the kids it was amazing and she's off your screaming and running aastra i'm not going to get her alright that concludes

{"data": "[Music] normally I run on the west side inside this point just mixing things up normally if New Jersey behind me that there that's Brooklyn well I could that's queen but that's Brooklyn okay that was 11 miles at a 751 pace Candice is in the shower behind me today is Candace's birthday I have like a really special afternoon planned for her that's a total surprise but this morning is just like her and me getting coffee I had forgot balloon in the little cake for her this morning so she thinks that's her whole birthday present the real presence this afternoon we're at Starbucks now she had an almond latte I let her pay for it even though it's her birth how's your birthday going so far great really happy birthday I have a good birthday see you tonight I have fun at work by little does Candice know what surprises are ahead now I'm just gonna race to the studio cuz I gotta dump this backpack get my boosted board charger and then I'm gonna go hide by our office I just want to see her reaction when she sees the post accord dead moose is mournful alright I think I see it I mean there's no way this is not it this is ridiculous this is the man to talk to hey good you're driving the ladies today yeah there's only three girls okay so this is should be enough space for ya I'm gonna tell you about them they're really nice girls you're gonna have fun with them okay cool can you talk to you about like taking your shirt off and doing the whole all the dancing and stuff on the peak inside all right so that's the door he's gonna load them in on right this is absolutely absurd all right all right let's good luck nice to meet you do it I'm such so absurd that's so fun I'm gonna go hide and try to film Candace Lee I just like want to get a shot of them getting into that limousine I'm gonna try to be somewhere where they won't see me okay all right this is the spot that's there's the pink limo there that's her office I'm gonna hide behind this FDNY truck here try to film from here I'm using the cameras pop-out screen there to film this way I'm not visible only the camera is no sign of them yet they're getting in the limo they don't see me [Music] you can't hear what she's saying if there's a lot of screaming all right think they're gonna leave soon I got a hide better so they don't see me it's more special for her if I'm not here put on your birthday surprise Candace so now they're just like going to a spa and they get like a massage and their nails done and I got pizza in there for them and champagne and that's kind of it that's the whole surprise but she seems so excited [Music] there is nothing nothing like a well-executed surprise one dime for my brother vans birthday we had the surprise party at a barbecue restaurant that was incredible and then for Candace it's tricky cuz she doesn't really like surprises so it has to be like basically you have to give her exactly what she wants before she asks for it which is by definition a surprise but there's some nuance there storytime I haven't done storytime in a while and since this morning was all about Candis and today is her birthday I thought I'd share Canada's story the most common question about Candis is why isn't she's smiling the thing that I find most attractive about her is she truly doesn't give two shits what anybody thinks and to all of the ladies that to all the people out there you smile when you want to smile don't you ever smile because somebody else tells you to alright so this story is going all the way back to 2008 that is eight years ago this is what we were sort of dating on and off this is when I was a much crazier much more reckless Casey and Candice was just 100% maniacs now this is the first time that I was like reconnecting with my old friends from Connecticut who I knew before I became a filmmaker and I wanted to make a positive impression on them so I invited Candace to this wedding she left an impression I don't know how it's going with those girls but I'm following their Instagram stories this is Candace's Instagram well at least I know the girls that work with her have a good time [Music] [Applause] [Applause] hanging out with my friends from Connecticut it's just like it was a great time it was like almost like a reunion of sorts canvas kept getting in trouble we got thrown out of one party cuz she find on the stage [Music] now with this fancy hotel room that Candice got us we also had access to their car my snowboards riding shotgun what's the verdict and naturally we took that to a guns well water on guns in their hands you can hear it it's so loud everything's being shut down yeah you wanna stop [Music] you know when I watch old footage like that it really the Candace that I know now and the girl that you see the woman that you see in these vlogs like she's my wife she's a mom she's a business owner she has employees she's starting a new company but back then she was just this maniac it was a great trip we're gonna cap during the airport we're leaving Vegas now anyway honey I'm glad to know ya and I hope you had a great birthday [Music]", "label": "G"}, {"data": "I hope that makes sense eight and half miles into my run right now and my mom's in town this weekend gave me a really hard time about these sunglasses she asked me to bring back the ones with the white just go ahead and comment below if I should stick with the purple or switch back to the white okay I would run all now hey so I made the pool thank you Monday morning big week this week I've got two business trips one to New Jersey one to Boston nothing too crazy both are for for speaking engagements and I think we're going to Texas although that might be next week nope nope Texas is this week they try not to travel as much for work lately like stay here Beach so let's get it done and that's been going yeah it's been going well probably a lot for work can be tough on the family so that's also been going well keeping it clean this week yesterday's episode I I showed you we talked about the new beam HQ and I introduce you to Jake who just joined the team a lot of questions in the comments about what's he doing and what are we doing at beam I want to get into that because I'm very excited that Jake is here hey hey don't how do we Jake how do we explain how do we explain what it is that you're that we're doing together now that's a good question I feel like maybe we should go outside what do you think of it right so the company the beam the app we shut down with Kenan bought the company but the company is something much more than just that act and now we're building out like a media wing to that company and that's where Jake referred so I was in Los Angeles lived there for a year and a half moved from New York to there and it was uh it wasn't for me it just wasn't my I wasn't my thing so when you know Casey came Colin was like hey we're doing this amazing of a beam let me tell you about it of again of course so I moved out here last week got an apartment and yes okay let me break down for you exactly what exactly one is we're trying to do okay trying to save time not being that the company here at the middle and the company is what may be me app when CNN bought being the company we shut down being the app because it wasn't doing very well so what there's a tech game intellectual property thankful resources no zu s oh and all the other company resources so even though the app is dead but even though the app is dead the company itself is still very valuable so you think it's gonna be legible say that so now being that company in addition to being a tech team with intellectual property in all kinds of resources we're not building a media arm to the company it's going to have shows and we're going to have our own YouTube channel and we're going to have other stuff and this this over here this is where Jake fits in the meet on the on the media stuff it is big and the last and the last important thing is use one of my valuable sticker my channel and my channel these these sort of live in their own bubble over here and this is important because I'm still going to be doing blogs and shows like this Nick still be doing is Vsauce we still have our channels this is what we're trying to build together and this is this is still ours I hope that makes sense let's go back outside we wanted to shoot this scene outside but we needed a table so we could do that like funny cut we slap it Yomi okay we go find an apart let's just we're in a playground we're not just a

something good [Music] [Applause] I just wanna say so this all started yesterday last night when I saw the tweet from Thoreau Scrooge idea miss Amy Butler a facin Jerome's a good friend of mine he's like a big social media guy but he's someone who's really concentrated his efforts and social media towards helping others dominant person enough lagunas he could be dying to know it - what room is talking about here is the current humanitarian crisis taking place in Somalia which isn't reported on that well here in the States but it is a it's a famine that's been brought on by a drought and a number of other geopolitical issues but it's affecting over 6 million people in Somalia alone see a bit on the opposite in the way to comp you see do it long way yet about so many so he tweeted that video he directed it at Turkish Airlines specifically because they're the only airline that flies to Somalia and and then it started to pick up traction and but my friend Jerome Jarre brought this to my attention that he thinks we can all help by getting an airplane filled with food and water to Somalia we can't let this happen we have to help these people use this hashtag get it trending get Turkish Airlines attention and quickly this started to gain traction it started to become bigger than just your own [Music] okay Friday night at 8:00 p.m. that's when I was in front of the computer and so horrible if I mean so Maya I googled how to get a flight so turkey Shannon is the only airlines going there I decided okay we have to do something we have to try to get this fried and fill it with food so it takes Ben hey Ben do you see what's happening in Somalia millions of people are about to die from famine just like in 2011 and this is Ben Stiller the famous actor uh-huh the original one we're launching the army now to provide the players then we are going to ask food companies and people to donate food and really tricking to frightful in water now it's go time do you guys want to document it yes you just said yes and the next day was it so wasn't easy yes sure and that's how all of this came together I didn't think you'd actually do it all right Jerome 1ba wampa never won yeah tell me what's going on give me the full give us the full update okay here is what's going on but five days ago I saw an article online about what's going on in Somalia and I wasn't aware I think made you haven't barely talked about it and so there is only one airline that goes there it's Turkish Airlines and so I thought okay why don't we ask the insurance if we can use that flight and fill it with food and bring bring some healthy do you feel like you're bullying carolina's I feel like we are getting them an opportunity to do something amazing you don't feel like you're shaming them into helping no we're like do you want to have they can say yes or no so we have a code with them at 1:00 p.m. which would you oh no it's in five minutes are in five minutes we have a call with and that's we're gonna find out if they're gonna help this campaigner head of communications everything is not anything what you can ready hello oh hey how are you today oh yes yes I'm here we strike on one buy and band and everybody's here so this phone call here is the official call whether with their find out from Turkish Airlines if they can actually lose their cargo planes to bring food and relief supplies to Somalia so yesterday we were told that on so there's this big 60 ton cargo flight and then after that as long as we bring food you get to make room right somehow no matter it doesn't really matter if it's a wide-body narrow-body as long as you know we find space bye-bye all right thank you guys 60 tons cargo flight to fill with food for Monday 27 that will go from Istanbul to Somalia and then we have an extra 140 140 tons that we can use of this space for the next six months all right if you didn't catch what has happened Turkish Airlines just agreed to fill up an entire cargo plane with 60 tons that's 120 thousand pounds of food and relief to go to Somalia they also just contributed another unless I'm saying this wrong I think it's another hundred and forty tons that they would put in there other planes that like extra space to go to Somalia this thing just got real like I just i sat there I witnessed it there was an idea and then a tweet and then the tweet turned into a movement which became something else that has now become action very important to recognize here how big of a deal it is for Turkish Airlines to have done this this isn't a commercial anything for Turkish Airlines they just stepped up and gave no idea what the cost could be that is a tremendous amount of resources to give an entire cargo plane and then plane after plane with extra cargo space to bring relief and for me personally look I retweeted it yesterday and I saw Jerome was doing this but right there when this had happened these guys did all the heavy lifting they did the hard work I offered to be a part of the fundraising so what's taking place now is there's a GoFundMe account that's linked below where they're trying we are trying to raise all the money to pay for all the supplies and infrastructure to bring all of that food to Somalia Ben Stiller's letting us use his charity the Stiller foundation so all donations are tax-deductible and will be managed appropriately you'll be able to see in fact everything donate if you can I know there's like a lot of bad things going on in the world right now there's a lot of things locally of concern but it's but it's hard to imagine a greater priority then you know millions of people starving to death and knowing that a couple bucks could impact that in a positive way and then also with some truth which is the fact that you know there are millions of people who are starving and struggling because of this drought because of this famine not just in Somalia but in Ethiopia and Kenya and South Sudan and Sudan and Uganda these planes and all this effort and all this energy that's being made by this little campaign is a drop in the hat but I think a very important first step is one of awareness which this seems like a very good first step towards but there are some links below if you want to understand more of what's happening there I also linked below the American Refugee Committee which you can also give money to they're doing work all over Eastern Africa I'll send this with like this cool video that Turkish Airlines sent us thank you everyone for watching thank you even more to people who contribute and thanks especially to Turkish Airlines for for for doing this as only a lawn that connects Somalia to the world we'll be more than happy to deliver you love and assistance to Somalia on your behalf as a Turkish Airlines family we're proud to be a part of this quite cool thank you I just want to say", "label": "G"}, {"data": "it's it's a [Music] [Applause] [Music] whoa like that hot sticky sweaty wet slimy day today in New York City the city's not so fun when it's raining up can't do anything the paint stripping gum and it drives the pants pretty quickly fell then one spot for too long my pants will literally catch on fire [Music] [Applause] now I'd like to have just a little bit of a heart-to-heart with you if that's up oh what's up I was just about to have like a heart-to-heart no you saved yeah you look good dad it's easy to like brush off bad YouTube comments like people make fun of you people tell you your videos suck people say unsub because I didn't get all that stuff it just rolls off your shoulder when you've made a bunch of videos and have been seeing it for years there's only one kind of comment that penetrates that like and those are the comments that confirm your worst suspicions those are the ones that like that actually speak the truth so I bring this up now because I'm always seeing a couple of comments that are like three six eight is bullsh I thought it was gonna be this big thing you're still just making regular videos and sometimes you hang out in there that hurts it really hurts because it's not the truth but it's also kind of how I feel like I when I first announced three six eight it was this huge initiative and I've done really nothing as far as you know the reality of it is that building a business is a really slow really painful process and we are working full full full steam ahead and we're doing incredible initiatives we have like a youtuber incubator program we're gonna bring together small youtubers it's very exciting we have like businesses built into it that our early generating revenue we have the three six eight gaming which is happening and then the biggest speed bump at all is this the space 368 at its core as I pitched it all revolves around the nucleus which is this physical space in downtown Manhattan the space still isn't done and we're doing everything we're throwing money at it we've spent just maybe even over a hundred thousand dollars working on that space like we're investing heavily in that space it's just not there yet we're almost there like look this is what the space looks like today today is July what's the date day this is my live feed from three six eight look it that's literally what it looks like right now like this is the current level of construction in the front space this morning it's it's can I get an amen amen it looks but it is exciting what's going on down there I do want to take you down now give you an update at 3 6 8 will you want to come yeah man let's go check it out you curious I'm a cop right yeah yeah it is hot I think you're gonna if you say it's hot I believe you alright let's go let's go [Music] it's good it's hotdogs sorry guys we're building good stuff so this wow I haven't seen the lighting yet so this space out here is gonna be the retail space like this room is open to the public this here is gonna be the sales desk see how it's uncomfortably high mm-hmm we want it to be really unwelcoming basically like yeah we want people to come up and kind of have the desk come to their chin and then they feel awkward and small yeah just be like intimidation yeah we don't want people to hang out in here so we thought we'd make it as unfriendly as possible but that's that this is the creator space back here and this whole space is meant to be modular or really a halfpipe here when my friends come around town they're like how do I get around New York City and now I can just be like here follow my super 73 as we got 10 of them you have one of these right [Applause] peekaboo mechanically much [Music] that whole thing moves again because you just explained the whole business model four three six eight in the most poetic okay okay okay go so it's it's the Medici family of Florence so they basically made their money in banking and I've been studying them for about ten years trying to figure out how to build the creative model because this is a family who had Galileo and and Michelangelo and some of the greatest artists of all time don't worry don't worry guys I'm dropping gems over here don't worry the the three six eight is very similar to that idea in the structure and so if you're talking about moving to Los Angeles I want us to figure out how we can do something together because I've been trying to build this forever three six eight west coast but I think right but Moore's more what's really exciting is that if we get this right the next Michael it the next Michelangelo YouTube exactly how do we end this how do we end this segment you're not man sometimes you just allow things to gently go their own way you know you don't want to say goodbye you don't you don't want to say so long you just want to like is this just what you do when you don't have an ending for something yeah well he's good he's good he's good you know what this social media thing doesn't work out you should be an actor [Music] 2006 the year that Will Smith's The Pursuit of Happyness came out you want something go get it period maybe my favorite Will Smith movie ever so this is a story that I told will today but when I first moved to New York City I lived in an SRO like a single room occupancy it was a place had no bathroom and no kitchen was a shared bathroom not a great place to live and I used to ride my bike almost every day like from where I worked all the way downtown all the way up to with this huge heavy bag with like all my camera gear in it and then this camera gear was like this burden it was like this weight I knew that that burden on my back was going to be what set me free like what all my dreams could come true if I just believed in this thing Chris Gardner was doing his best but his fast wasn't enough in that movie invest all this money into these like heavy bone-density scanner things and his whole savior like the only way he's gonna be able to make it alive is if he sells these stupid heavy things and he's lugging them around everywhere and like I remember seeing that movie I was like a couple years later and I sort of found my footing and just like bawling my eyes out for that entire movie because I saw so much of myself in that main character as this struggling single father who who knew that he could find his way and and achieve what he wanted to achieve in life for himself and his family and and I and meeting will today like brought that full circle anyway a great movie you should see it if you've never seen it great day today okay really truly awesome to have you by well I'm in three six eight with my man Casey in the building so three six eight as an artist Haven is that how you describe it this is well he's our new spokesperson yes new spoiler checks in

feel like going straight back to the city [Music] sightseeing in the in the great city of Philadelphia Jesse didn't use Scylla fear [Music] if the drone cinematography is enough to snuff it's because just using the little spark here I don't know how to controller for this thing yet having to control it on a little touchscreen cell phone which isn't great but the fact that I have a drone in this little purse is just amazing so you are a baby I think that just about wraps on our day in Philadelphia in that sesame place review of sesame place huge thumbs up if you have little kids bring them there if you have older kids maybe not so much little kids though perfect thoughts in Philadelphia great city okay all right [Music] bottles like a touchdown remember me forget me", "label": "G"}, {"data": "I'll use you as my thumbnail - should never be like this yeah that's pretty good [Music] today's episode is about two things first a viral video then headphones what does the viral video have to do with headphones absolutely nothing [Music] so after months of planning days of shooting many hours of editing today the day that we release it they say we click like make public what's up buddy you look tired tired dude how do you think the video came out Oh dark in here you got this view behind you in the windows closed yes it's so night okay I haven't seen the actual movie you know I haven't seen the cut yet this is me seeing it for the first time right now well we're gonna watch it but I promise Carmela's you already watch it okay well you sit down Casey I watch this okay this is me seeing it for the first time [Music] good what you just died the famous Carmela would you think you did a great job as Princess Leia Jessie you make a great Luke yeah an ugly one use that it's up and I'm going to bed yeah it doesn't look very loud okay so the videos were just sent alive that's the most satisfying thing because when you click the publish button it means it's done just to define what viral is viral for me help me with this definition Jessie it's when it does like significantly more views than what a typical video does right if like a news Twitter shares it and there's on the news and then it's then it's like on the trend the page and then it's on Reddit and then it's like everywhere Google doesn't put me on the training page anymore Jessie all right go to bed bro I love y'all nice Portuguese who did it later so what'd you really think this video [Music] there's this guy his name's Peter and he made like what I would describe is maybe the greatest Casey Neistat vlog troll ever he made an entire movie which is just him making fun of me but it's really good listen to when I run right now I'm listening to my inner voice telling me to stop with any kind of physical activity oh I'll link it below but it's it's pretty good he did a pretty great job making fun of me in any event this guy's from I believe Eastern Europe I think Czech Republic and ah well he's actually he's outside my studio right now I guess he came here all the way from Eastern Europe to do some something with me which I don't recommend doing if you're thinking of traveling to New York to see me don't do that I have a family and stuff and I'm not but I have a minute right now and he did make this in a fun of me out of boosted board he made this very thorough movie making fun of me and I feel like the least I could do is go hang out with the guy [Music] are you cold I'm very cold but that's the sacrifice do you need a sweatshirt no no no I'm good I'll get him I'm gonna put you in my vlog okay perfect we're trying to look we kind of look alike you know what exactly are we doing here we're doing the impossible day off Casey nice step to the parody that you shared because so what does that entail I don't entirely understand what we're doing but he's so excited see this I'm right over here there's not very good lighting outside my office it's a little bit here see it's like a dark yellow a shadowy this fine okay what do I do now did I do it good its attention to detail you know how to make the magic happen here okay ready this didn't make sense at all what are you talking about so now we shoot it in here well then we have a little change of plans this is going to take like 15 minutes if it's old you are using up way this is I got to pick the baby up um I'm gonna do it really fast okay go yes sorry I just gotta get the babysitter I got I love drunks I just love flying drums since I was no come on I always like meeting new creators those two were a couple of real goofs I know I said today's episode was two segments and that was technically a third segment but I hope you can understand that I didn't hit segments coming otherwise I would have included that in my introductory statement to this video now it's time for part two which is also part three headphones I shot this next part like a week ago but I want to have some test time so it would make sense hello this will be a comprehensive review of these new Bose sound support free headphones that when it comes to headphones for me I kind of have like two schools of headphones and one are the headphones that I edit with my go-to there are the Bose quiet like the bose noise-canceling bluetooth ones they're great literally zero complaints here and then the second camp are the headphones that are run with and that's what that's what these are for first a few words on my edit headphones I can't run in these because the way that them the way that the ear cup fits here it fills up with sweat gets disgusting after like two weeks ahead phone's start to smell like a foot and then you put them on your head and your head smells like a foot it's just they're not good for running I have tried Apple's ear pods I like them but my main phone is a note 8 I don't need to run with my iPhones it's not water resistant so and honestly the thing about the ear pods is they don't like block out enough of the surrounding sound I'm hoping for a winner here okay now for the unboxing [Music] okay here they are this is like the recharging case it's a little it's bigger than the these things are a little fatter than I expected I don't know if you can see how big they are do they look super weird but feel like there's a big thing sticking out of my ear alright comprehensive test nine quarter miles it's like a little over an hour and three minutes of non-stop running I gotta say these are very impressive they haven't been bouncing I haven't had to adjust them or like they haven't they haven't budged the sound quality is excellent I think the only beep is that they don't close out the noise around me so even if I have them on full volume I can still hear this music playing from the mini golf course right behind me and I love sugarpie honeybunch but when I'm listening to Wu Tang I wish you did a better job of blocking out the noise otherwise maybe the best running headphones never used all right so it has been a week since I got these these headphones and first thing to address is the price these are $250 which is insane for a pair of headphones that are these are ones these are the Apple ones the ear pods these are 160 what like home these are called air pods these cost a hundred almost $100 less than these cost this sound in these have you ever listened to these you're a big ear pod guy right tell me the comparison I use air pots every single how you even put these in you hear anything you should know too that Sam is the biggest an Apple fanboy on planet Earth anywhere is this stupid at your pods every day but for the base with the base ready really base heavy yeah I can't barely hear myself talk this is weird they're like really good for sound yeah these are impressive these are really impressive Incred incredible okay thank you that was a unexpected supportive Sam's just in this video colonias earpods now for the not so good I don't know if I mention this but this is not a paid video this is like a not sponsored I bought these off Amazon I had two hundred and fifty dollars well everything needs to be perfect so first thing first they're huge they have to fit in this case here see this case very good case the case recharges them five times or something like that but in my pants okay ready that is like are those headphones in your pockets are you happy to see me that's a lot - that's a lot right there especially when you compare - this is a little bit too much always fit in your pocket like a cell phone then the last thing and I don't mean to sound like a snob with this but when you wear headphones all day it becomes fashion right Sam that's right now I think that these look really really stupid in your ears they're white they kind of drool out it looks like you have like just kind of gross the way these look in your ear do you like the way these look these look I think these look stupid but despite them looking stupid there's no denying that they have a look right it's like this is very Apple industrial design they fit in here perfectly when you see people you know what they are the way these fit in your ears quote my wife Candace I will not hang around with you as long as those things are sticking out of your ears they are enormous no like I need like this is like a this is like a maybe a medical device somebody said to me it looks like I've got two babies pacifiers in my ears now I have to say I'm the biggest Bose fan I love your products I don't mean to just be making fun of you like this but this is legitimately how I feel when I wear your headphones so this is an actual baby's pacifier and this is your $250 wireless headphone head headphone piece they aren't they in my pocket all day every day solution like I than to be and like so many people use the air pods for these always with you always I want that but I also want better sound quality and I also wanted to work with my s8 that's it for KC's tech review today please tune in next know what I'm gonna do these it's been about four hours since we released the video I can't quite tell like how the views are going sits on Jesse's channel and not mine [Music] yo did did this video go viral or what [Music] so we can call it viral all right Jesse call a viral it's like the morning after I filled in that last bit and I'm not gonna run this one keeps getting disconnected which is super fun knowing tellus my music it's like coming in now this is my Fagin hate blue to it man it's gonna be cable he's want to run out here it's like this is so frustrating I just want to hear my music when I'm running and it's freezing cold outside I don't want to be messing with these I just want to run this left one here kept getting disconnected from the right one music coming here and not here and this is a software issue Bose I hope you can fix this but in the meantime in the meantime I have to amend my review from a cautious thumbs up to a more neutral like mmm I hope they can improve them in the future until then I don't know that I'll be running with these or using these because like I can't I can't add a stab giving it go thank you Sam you gonna plug

check out the first of which is in this very hotel I was told this is the coolest pool and all of Helsinki [Music] I didn't bring a bathing suit so you will have to excuse the censorship [Music] dr. Koo look whoever prevented well [Music] so this is my second day in Helsinki it's also my last day in Helsinki and I haven't actually gotten out and like explored the city at all I have one free hour

suppose [Music] [Applause] [Music] and this way go together yeah yeah [Music] that's the coolest thing ever [Music] that's the US Embassy right there [Music] so the event that I'm going to speak at right now the one seat yet today is a different event entirely from yesterday two events two different days put back-to-back it's part of the reason why I decided to make the long trip to Helsinki is because the opportunity to speak to different audiences on two different days was just really good timing it's so cold outside right now it's like freezing outside I'm not I'm not trying to make excuses but this thick fog rolled in and I don't know how to get around this town but I could always see the tower of the hotel where I'm staying and now I don't lost I think it's over here somewhere no no I was just a brick wall right boosted boards out of juice there it is there's the hotel I supposed to be there at 3:30 perfectly on time look yeah hello nice to meet you guys see you later 3:30

a while here on tech review Tuesday we get a special package a special product that is yet to be released to the public we check it out first today is such day I'm aware that today is Thursday not Tuesday but we couldn't open these on Tuesday because there was a press embargo these are the accessories Pro 2 1 Matic pro 2 2 all right so we have the two new Mavic pros here this is the Mavic 2 pro the pro has a big fat warning sensor on it that means better image quality better low-light better color better everything this is the Mavic pro 2 zoom this one's got a 24 - 24 to 48 millimeter optical zoom lens okay now for the [Music] all right so before we get into the flight test of these drones I just want to talk about how I actually judge drones drone quality etc so you've got two axes you've got the quality how good is the picture that it yields anywhere from okay to top-notch versus the price expensive less desirable cheap everybody wants cheap this is the sweet spot here you want a cheap but top-quality drone so you start with something like this spark here the spark is the spark is 399 dollars which is very cheap but the quality the quality is just about okay so the spark I put right about there then there's the folding maverick air and the Medicare is improved quality slightly more expensive I've put it right about there the original Mavic it has absolutely stellar quality and it's not that expensive at 999 I put it right about there this thing at best quality for consumer marketing drones that DJI sells quality is all the way over here but they start at $1500 and they go up from there depending hours control are you getting all that chest so they're more like here now testing the maverick to zoom and then a b-2 pro the price puts them well the price puts them right in the middle here and the quality is to be determined but obviously I'd love to see it right right around here so we're heading to a prime drone flying area where there's lots of things to look at and we can fly there legally Justin why can we fly in Coney Island legally 20 islands outside commercial airspace Class B so it's just outside of JFK's like no-fly zone or whatever just another reminder to always respect the rules of the Federal Aviation Administration right yeah you got it that's exactly right so we are here at New York City's Coney Island seem like the prime location to test [Music] [Music] my first time flying the zoom having a zoom lens especially one in the air lets you do things that otherwise would be impossible with the drones one of the cool things though is it's letting me do it live so like or automatically so I go 48 millimeter I swipe up to 24 and it automatically zooms out or in so the implementation it's very good I mean very good for a beginner for sure it's more expensive it does have guys Hasselblad one inch sensor on that that means like a bigger better camera that should yield better dynamic range better colors better low-light better kind of everything [Music] that is the regular Mavic in Mavic one we're gonna fly all of DJ's legacy drones now to compare the image quality between the old drones and these and these two new drones [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] yeah [Music] [Music] [Music] have you been out here yet I had a hot dog yeah you told me that we were gonna eat hot dogs now no hot dogs no hot dogs we gotta go back hot dog is not sitting well at all ah as someone who's super fluent with consumer and prosumer level drones having looked at the footage that these things yield I am not surprisingly but I am extraordinary impressed with what they're capable of the pro in particular has amazing dynamic range in just this camera that they've managed to put on here is just an extremely impressive camera and that's how's the chicken game away from the nomadic zoom if I had to guess I would say the zoom yields a very similar image to the Mavic one but that zoom feature is extraordinary and personally I think that this zoom is going to be my new go to number one drone this this will be the drone that lives in my camera bag this will be the drone that I travel with this will be my new drone so what that means for my my chart here I take the Maverick to pro at fourteen hundred and forty nine dollars and I put it I put it right about here the quality is top-notch the price is still a little bit expensive but the Mavic to zoom that zoom feature the quality is top and the price considering what it does the closest drone to the sweet spot of any drone I've ever used and I would say that DJI with these two latest releases once again shows that when it's time to buy a drone it's not do you buy DJI drone it's just which DJI drone Dubai [Music] if I am gonna complain about one thing though it says the old nav Achaemenid that never really stayed on there well and it's kinda well I'm kind of unhappy to report that they haven't done much better with the Maverick - it has this and I can't figure out how to [Music]", "label": "G"}, {"data": "[Music] [Music] every morning in the night stet household this is I would start our day and play there everything's a-okay you dancin come on it's

ago a Batman throw this part on the bike path right here and he killed eight people and injured others to make sure no one would ever be able to drive a car down the bike path again the city of New York and the NYPD but these concrete barriers all along the bike path make sure no car could fit in thank you to the NYPD thank you to the city of New York for taking these measures to keep us safe I as a cyclist and someone who uses this path appreciate it very much but and it's been nearly a year since these blocks here were put into place and while they are effective in preventing cars from driving through here they do make it dangerous for cyclists and runners and people walking on this path to trying to get in and around this used to all be open for traffic to your both ways but now you see there's a small opening here a slightly larger when they're a tiny one there that she's coming through and then two smaller ones here in this particular case that the things blocking the road take up about 90% of the of the path itself and here this corner here is just a confusing mess if someone's coming around the corner on foot and then you got a biker or a runner coming this way well it's just begging begging for an accident [Music] these things for example seems like they could stop a car and they still enable fights to kind of move around and they seem like a really good kind of permanent solution or [Music] these things you're also great look no cars again through this and you can still get your body curved skateboard or whatever get around them really easily so maybe you can put something that looks like this in place of these terrible things so in conclusion I appreciate you I appreciate all the efforts made to keep us safe in the city but maybe we could maybe get rid of these things and put in a put in something that's a little bit safer and a little bit more permanent of a solution I can't begin to tell you how many times I've nearly injured myself on these and I can't imagine I'm alone thank you [Music] exit flags not that kind of flexing I do want to do a little flexing though because there's something that I've been waiting for all summer long I'm really excited about it and I want to share it with you and it's a little bragged it's like a but I'm just mostly excited to share it okay I primarily edit and work off of my macbook pro this thing it doesn't okay job I mean I complain about on the locks there's a lot of stuff they don't like but it does a pretty good job but I have been wanting to experiment with two things number one a Windows machine into using Adobe software I want to kind of switch ultimately from Final Cut Pro over to premiere because well everybody that I know uses premiere is very happy with it and I'm like this with Final Cut I had a custom computer built a custom KC computer built it's done it's here it's in that red box this is looking for you ready for all you gamers out there familiar with this stuff okay I get it you've seen it before this is new to me I've never I've only ever had this is what my computer looks like play the garbage can look at this orange yellow green pink on Oh on oh look that I gotta go downstairs and eat Candice main gear thank you this is awesome I'm excited to get into this real talk I haven't talked to you about the podcast the podcast that Candice and I do couples therapy haven't talked to you about in a little while well I haven't talked to you about all the progress we've made over here in a while either oh this is funny are you doing good camera work the hell's going on here what's she doing in this meeting my radio podcast yeah okay a couple of things number one we haven't done a podcast in a while and there's a reason for that if you listen to the podcast you know that the podcast is really like real like we don't mess around we don't pull punches it's just it's honest and it's real and we've been dealing with some lately and that we hadn't resolved and I just wasn't comfortable doing the podcast until we had resolved that stuff so we could be honest and not fake it on the pod so I just wanted to explain it to you so I don't want you think it was a matter of me or us being lazy it wasn't that at all there was more to than that and this will happen again in the future when we miss uploads yes my dear we can't plan our arguments around a podcasting schedule yeah if we're like dealing with we're like struggling in our marriage and relationship we can't just turn that off to come record a podcast I hope you understand this is just us being honest alright so that's it this podcast is live though you should go download it the link is below and one thing that's interesting is we saw our numbers like our downloads and how many people are listening to this podcast it's insane millions and millions I had no idea so thank you to everyone for the constant support of the podcast Candice thanks you too come on say something hello my baby hello my darling hello my ragtime gal Thank You Candice for that ok that's it we'll see you later this is it we're just like on the podcast listen to it [Music] baby my heart on fire if you

Shore 6.2 miles even 10k at a relaxed but still 647 pace 6:47 per per per month I saw dudes this morning on the on the Hudson River that here in New York City on jet skis summers coming who that

audience they're gonna be mad they missed it Marlon let me see it let me see it let me see it I was here that cutter starving it's like that's the vlogging camera that Elmo would carry so I'm animal well he's my favorite Sesame Street character and I'm gonna favorite GPS guy to have had my good luck in my review of this this is the rx100 mark 5 in my review of this I said that the focus was a little slow I was wrong Sony got in touch with me and explained how to change the settings autofocus here you autofocus drive speed right change that too fast yeah now you're in focus now I'm in focus fast right right thank you for letting you know Sony but also why not have a chip with the autofocus and fast right cuz I was supposed to figure that out all my stuff was a bigger than up yeah no nobody knows that he is the saying I just love those I go there what you I haven't done this in a while but I'm going to do a QA the reason why I haven't done it is because I really love to having a sweet intro to the QA segment and I haven't shot a new one so I'm just going to keep this short then I'll shoot a new one and they'll be awesome again my Q&amp;A format is I just sort of tweet and say ask some questions people asking questions on Twitter I answer them right here my healthy snack selection first first question that says can you put this in the vlog yes sure no problem consider it done we need a father-and-son vlog well Owen is at college right now on the other side of the country I know there has been a father-son video in a long time but that's what happens when the kid goes to college do you get sick of traveling yes I still have to travel but sometimes I wish that I could stay here and focus more hi Casey so do you like living in New York City or would you rather move somewhere else ah New York City is my favorite place on planet earth I absolutely love living in New York City I do foresee a time when we move we've talked about in the past but it's tough to raise children here but besides that this is like the greatest place ever how's Owen doing College is doing great I need to get like a 3.8 GPA yeah he's in fantastic what music do you listen to when you run I like to listen to podcasts you get really like focus on what you're listening to you pay attention you start to forget about how long you've been running and it makes the pain go away who makes your great pocket - I don't know I'm not wearing that I'm wearing a billy shirt by my wife Candice link below Canon or Sony um I love them both cam fantastic I switched to Sony because all of my vlogs across the board now are 4k even when I shoot on my cell phone and canons really behind in the 4k Department do I go to college or nah that is a very complicated question I think if you don't know what you want to do definitely go to college it's a great place to figure out what you want to do what you want to spend the of your life doing for a career if you do know what you want to do and that doesn't require a degree skip college take the money you would have spent on tuition and invest that in experiences that promote what it is you want to do how is Candace feeling about you vlogging again you know Candace the family they're not in the vlog as much on season three and that's because I'm trying really hard to not have this vlog sort of interrupt my family life or my personal life there are times with Candace and me that feel entirely appropriate to have her in it and she's psyched and I'm psyched like we're in Miami feels like family time I make a more concerted effort to keep the camera away what point-and-shoot camera do you recommend I'm a pretty big fan of the rx100 Mark five where do you get your boosted boards from booster board so how long is the blow that alas this time hey Casey I'm those double of in the last rocket I am scared mommy that is a good question because this vlogs not gonna last forever there will be an end to this vlog probably in a few months and then I'll take a bunch of time up and then I'll probably started up again with the season for the reason behind that is the first season I had no idea didn't think I'd ever end it and that like really wait on me heavily but thinking of this series thinking of this show is something that's cyclical has a beginning has an end and it starts up again it's much easier for me to sort of wrap my head around it makes me love this more so this will end I just don't know what if you blogging would be H oh well vlogging now is kind of my part-time job you know I work for the company that I founded that's now owned by CNN that is my job so my job is building a media and technology company vlogging is something I do because I love I love doing it how do I like my steak I like my steak like you know medium rare ish I read somewhere that our president likes his steak well-done would ketchup I don't like it I don't like my steak well-done Casey so I am moving to New York next month in Iceland just grab on for dear life this city has a way of kicking people's asses like you cannot imagine my advice is make sure if you're moving here because this is where you want to be because there's nothing easy about living in this town alright that's it I hope you enjoyed the new I hope you enjoyed the Q&amp;A is back you know here Dan awesome to intro so Q&amp;A will feel more complete in the interim I usually do second hey Kenneth are you are you okay going to LA tonight yeah there's an 8 o'clock flight sure ok cool ok great and we'll take the baby ok cool clay back just so you know it's currently 5:15 p.m. and that flight is in three out three three hours no big deal this is going to be a slightly stressful evening got to go home pack up the whole family and then we have about an hour to get the airport and then we're flying over night with the baby but should be fun to be fine wish me luck [Music] you [Music] that's a stop here for a second this is a magical spot in a magical time in all of Manhattan ready okay so it looks like the sun's coming from there but then the sun's also coming from there and this isn't Star Wars there isn't a planet with two suns that's the actual Sun and then the way they built this building here it reflects the Sun but always like ten minutes a day look how evenly I'm lit this looks like movie lighting does anybody else care about this there's just like a filmmaker thing and now look now just one light of a dick one light you're light one light two suns - that's the new suitcase so excited about this given no idea okay this is great so it's perfect that we're going on this trip tonight this is made for babies okay where does the baby go I just want to make sure that you're okay with getting out of plane right now and learning the Los Angeles College has I had a value message that's a doctor - Wow cool everything I should take volume everywhere it's a terrible idea what are you going to possibly put in that for 24 hours and California well you don't have to take this big one you could just take this well I thought you didn't take the whole thing intimidate you sit on it I'm only going for 48 hours in a packing nine pair of underwear you never known you just don't want to take chances when it comes to underwear do you think we're going to make the play the flights at 8 it's 56 right now you'll think we're gonna make it if we miss the play I just want to make sure it's because you forgot the bottle not because of me all right Kirk and it's going to help me with this system yeah if Casey [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] flight takes off literally in 37 minutes here let me take the baby the babies in the future what are you doing no but we're really late for what should we do and it's just a baby I'm going through the quick line with all the bag I think we're probably okay they took our check-in so it's probably taking flight without it [Music] [Applause] couple fans in the back of the plane this is my first insight Rita it about something had all the kids okay baby scream the whole fight but it's fine we're in California [Music]", "label": "G"}, {"data": "don't want you to much how much you want to

you today I want to do a special 1,000,000,000 view Q&A have another Q&A in a while getting a lot of requests for it so here we go Gina what single video made the most impact in terms of those 1,000,000,000 ok the most impactful video from use a movie i made called bike lanes wait right there bike lanes was the first movie I made when I started my own YouTube channel that truly went viral on YouTube demonstrated to me the power of YouTube this one video in two days did more views than my entire HBO series did for the life of the show and that blew my mind that affirmed my thinking that YouTube was where I wanted to direct my focus for the future do you think you can achieve a billion views this fast without the vlog no chance there's just no way that you can get those kind of numbers without uploading a lot of content what video you the most proud of and the most part of a movie called my kidding me it's this like 22 minute epic i made about Owen John Barnes what's your biggest advice for filmmakers on 13 years old don't waste your time with film school we are a place right now in this genre where you can buy a camera or you can use your cell phone to make videos that will reach tens of thousands or millions or hundreds of millions of people you don't need the formalities of filmmaking that they teach in school instead take the money that your parents or you or you would borrow to go to film school take that money and spend it on living life this is very much like Vernon Hertzog theory around filmmaking spend that money spend those resources on experiences his filmmaking is not about the craft it's not about the camera's not about the gear it's about telling stories and sharing experiences and sharing perspectives and if you're only perspectives in life are the ones your professor taught you in film school you're gonna have a really tough time making something people care about i am very much pro academia i am my kids in college right now and I could not be more proud of him it is film school that I take issue with no one can teach you how to be a storyteller you have to live to be able to do that how are you celebrating I'm not I'm not celebrating I'm making this video and i'm just putting my head down and making more videos i believe in like benchmarks and I'm proud of 1 billion but with each successful comes a bigger more ambitious with each success comes a bigger and more ambitious goal and this success just motivates needed to do more do more YouTube do more in life create more make more reach more people last questions I think it's romantic how much credit do you get Candace on those 1 billion views about 950 million of those 1 billion views i got after I married Candace having a support system like a family is absolutely instrumental in keeping focus and working hard and everything that contributes to your success to my success yeah I mean don't tell her i said this right credit canvas would like all of my success but don't tell her I said thanks to go straight to her head honey I've got that what I was riding my skateboard really slowly and I was going to a pothole and I crash I've the Rolex why do my father can hello I Stanley so how's everything going I just cool to say hello so what do we do about this thing to relax i understand there's no cracks or anything me neither but I must have hit pretty hard with my elbow high school we're having a picnic again tonight that's not my family what's up we're boarding the family picnic there are bugs and there's like goose it everywhere i'm sorry the pic failed at that epic fail I tried really hard to make it special now it's a good but it was a good try tell so hard yeah", "label": "G"}, {"data": "t-series is just a few subscribers away Red Alert red alert I'm calling upon my last trick I have up my sleeve I didn't think it would come to this but I guess I have no choice the one thing that can stop t-series book review you noticed how as soon as I stopped doing book reviews sorry about that by the way T's series two sways out of nowhere and took over but no I realize now in the eleventh hour what I must do I must review books again that's whatever one wants that's what will stop T series it's never been so clear to me I can't believe I realized it just now book time the first book well I read a lot of books but I wanted to select the ones that I really really loved there's three of them but I want to talk about and hopefully you'll check them out as well the first one is the Master and Margarita written by Nick Nicola Mikhail Bulgakov it was written during the Soviet Union regime and during that time I didn't know this but atheism was sort of forced upon the population it was forced in schools and people were generally harassed into becoming atheists so this novel is sort of an answer to that a lot of Russian books I've read so far our features themes around Christianity but I think it's safe to say I never read a book like this it's a black satire it's a black satire comedy around Christianity it's very weird but I really loved it ironically mikail the author burned the first version of this book because he thought he would never make it as a writer writing a story like this during this time and he wasn't wrong because when he actually finished it 10 years later he died shortly after so it's nothing funny about that and he wasn't published until 26 years after that so it took a while but it was recognized as a masterpiece and it really is the story follows a mysterious character who visits a group of writers sitting in a park during an autumn afternoon and this mysterious character is a professor in black magic these group of writers are obviously curious who he is and they suspicious that he might be a spy and he gets mistaken for one this mysterious character is the devil reincarnated and named in the in the book Vohland all the writers are atheists and Bolin describes the second setting of the story which in Jerusalem during the Pontius Pilate trials everyone knows about this the the trial is about the execution of Jesus the writers almost say it's possible that it's never happened it's possible that Jesus never existed and boland sort of smugly describes his event as if he was actually there which is obviously impossible bolon also predicts that one of the writers head will come off in an accident and this of course gets brushed off but later becomes true and get witnessed by one of the other writers Yvonne Yvonne goes absolutely crazy trying to pursue boland trying to capture him in absolute madness absurdity and comedy I love reading this part it gets even better from there The Devil's midnight ball is wasn't one of my favorite parts of anything I read in a while it's it's just fantastic so I will just end it there but Micaela the author of The Master and Margarita he used to be a playwright so it makes the writing very visual I can really see all the characters and mannerism and the humor in front of me it really feels like you were there when you read it and which really works well for the comedy as well I laughed a lot of times reading this book and all this has really put together in a masterful story it's a story that blends history with the author's own stories that he he lived through and his own strides it's a perfect balance I think of good and evil and I really really loved it it was actually recommended by one of you guys so I read one of the comments saying in another book review saying oh I think you're really gonna love this book and you were right so thank you very much the master margarita five out of five thank you for suggesting an actual good book the next book I want to talk about it as Japanese death poems and haiku what is it called it's a really long title Japanese deaf poems written by Zen monks and haiku poets on the verge of death that may sound very depressing to read but for me I thought it was very uplifting I'm very fascinated by the Eastern view or the eastern Asian view of death as a Swedish person it's almost a taboo subject it's something that I grew up you don't really talk about and I think that's probably for a lot of people who has least watches this video which I think makes it just even lonelier and scarier to think of that I don't think it's a healthy approach and the Japanese view is more of a it's something death is something that's part of life one of my favorite quotes from a book another great book I read actually I recommend in the region would by Murakami death is not the opposite of life but an innate part of it by living our lives we nurture death anyhow this view of death is deeply rooted in Japan and Japanese culture through death poems or just say as their call that sounds funny and its origin comes from Zen Buddhism and the first documented Zhu se is from Prince Tatsu in 1686 but just like still occurring today I find out about deaf poems from one of my favorite writers Yukio Mishima and I was just so fascinated by the fact that that's an actual thing a small night storm blows saying falling is the essence of a flower preceding those who hesitate to put it simply it's a poem written at the time that but sometimes they're written even before sort of as you write a will for example haiku is a form of poetry you're probably already familiar with it follows the five seven five syllable count vashu world famous Japanese poet who defined this style of writing where you count the syllables of the poem his deaf poems reads as falling ill on a journey my dreams go wandering over withered fields haiku is often focus on the transient of things thus often reflects on nature bringing in the sadness of leaves falling from the cherry blossom because they don't last very long for example here's one written by Beynon now spring has come into my world farewell so the book starts off with Zen Buddhism which it's actually my favorite part of the book I didn't think I would enjoy it I kind of wanted to just jump to the Hyksos but it just features incredible stories of Zen Buddhists or masters that died sitting upright and right after they finished their last brush strokes of their poem I don't know if that's true or not but it just sounds it sounds badass and I like the idea that there's actual records of this badass Munk movie cliche that you see it actually has some merit to it the book features around 300 haikus some are funny some are sad some are strange I'll read some more examples I wish to die in spring beneath the cherry blossoms while the springtime moon is full written by Saigon here's another one I liked death poems are merit delusion death is death this one's written by by psyche the journey west a way that all would travel flower-filled west is said to be where the paradise is in I don't know when they believe in their dying with the regret is seen as a bad thing to carry when you're passing over to to the paradise this poem is a perfect example of a haiku because it brings in something personal mixed with nature another one for example I long for people then again I load them end of autumn it's almost comical isn't it how can we fit nature in there and a bottom but I really do love haiku I think it's a it's a perfect way to really describe an emotion I'd really like the idea of bringing something over bringing structure to something abstract of a mixing left and right brain mixing art with logic for example having the the set of rules of how a poem should be and now I think that's what really makes them good as well so I wrote a poem myself heritage if you want him autumn moon shines bright a lonely red leaves falls down your mom gave no I'm just kidding okay at ending road ahead I should travel back home soon forever sunset the way the Japanese language works it's obviously different because the syllables are are much more defined as were the letters are cold goal Wow gosh she and someone and so forth so it doesn't really work the same way in English and there's all kinds of techniques that also doesn't really translate so it's never gonna be you can try and translate haikus to English but it's never gonna be the same thing obviously but I recommend writing a haiku it's it's actually really easy it's actually really fun all you need to know is that it's five syllables first line seven syllables live em in line and then five syllables afterwards and it's usually something personal mixed with nature and a passing moment described so why don't you try it I wouldn't give this book higher than a four star rating it is quite dense in the beginning it felt like I didn't need to it also had a strange structure to it which was kind of annoying when reading it other than that it's a great book it features a lot of haikus that's never been translated before so I really really loved it and I remember commended to you even as much as any other book I talked about today next but dumb Keshawn yeah that's right you never heard about this one everyone knows about donkey Shawn but the nobleman who read too many night stories and decided to go on a knight's errand hey even though that doesn't exist anymore everyone knows about the story of donkey shot who mixed up the windmills with Dragons and fought them anyway but I think most of all everyone knows danke Shon for its humor and for how silly it is and and what a loveable character is but and yes it is it is very humorous but after reading it I realized that it's so much more than just that and I'm so glad I read it it's my favorite piece of classical literature that I have ever read it was written in 1600 by Cervantes I don't know I probably pronounced that wrong and it's been described as the best literary work ever written I've also seen is described as unreadable there's a lot of different versions of donkey shot to make it more normal I don't know I read I remember I read donkey shot before but a stripped down version of it but nothing really could read the original the book is written in a way where donkey shot seems like he's an actual person that exists in the world a terrible example would be kind of like found horror movie clips to make it seem real this is lost archives to make it seem like oh yeah this is this is a real story that actually took place in donkey shot is a real person in the second half of the second part of the book Cervantes is even himself mentioned in the story because of course the first book has already come out and donkey shot is now famous and donkey shot reacts to other people reacting to donkey shot which is hilarious as well so it's it's really funny and bizarre thing but anyway the story also of course follows not just donkey shot but he's famous and loyal squire sancho panza who joins donkey shot in the promise of becoming a governor one day Sancho had great relief to donkey Shawn because he sort of questions his ideas and his sanity and all these random insane inter fair interactions that donkey shot goes through when in his pursuit of knights-errant virtue and all that because donkey shot believes everything he's reading in books so he treats the whole world as if that's the case and anything that sort of challenges that idea and goes against that idea he blames on one way or another it could be that oh it's a wizard sage cast a spell on me so I'm under under illusions and that's why that's why I see it for no one else does what makes this funny or I think at least what makes this work is that donkey shot is actually completely reasonable as a person the way he justifies all these things happening and the way he justifies his action is completely reasonable you realize he's not an idiot he's not a pool and he can suede Sancho Panza to to follow him and do what he wants him to do and he believes it himself 100% as well that's the thing but of course other people don't believe donkey shot and whatever ideas he has and he becomes a mockery Oh for them as well the fact that donkey shot wholeheartedly believe is it it makes it really sad it's a really sad story in a lot of ways I think a lot of people can probably relate to as at least when you were younger wanting to do something noble wanting to do something greater but as you grow older you you sort of give up on that idea I mean everyone does obviously but not donkey shot and this story tells tells of that tale and you can really only love him for him donkey shot and Sancho Panza really are legendary characters I I miss them it's really weird to say that it's such a long book but it's the it's the longest book I've read but it's also the longest book I've ever enjoyed and honestly I can't wait to reread it I could go on more but there's really no point it is it is quite hard at some points and I would lie every lying say if I thought it was like the easiest read I ever had but it's 100% worth it so check it out if you're interesting check out all these books donkey shot five out of five beautiful I'm so glad I read it now for next book review I wanted to mention a book that you guys can read and we can discuss it in next book next month if I do a book review when I do a book review it will be the woman in the dunes by a Cobra Abin I don't know if that's how it's pronounced kebab has been described as the Casca of Japan it's a pretty short story so holy shit I forgot to mention the book it has some very strong sexual parts in it I guess this is a trigger warning I probably should have realized before I recommended this but anyone can pick this up and read it in I don't know a week or two and it's a concept that I think it's a interesting to discuss so if you're looking for something to read check that out and I'll talk about it in the next month as always if you have recommendations for me I always find that interesting I've also created a subreddit where you guys can discuss as well and interact and I will take part from that and reviews and ideas in the next book review so hopefully we can have a more of a dialogue going because I felt like that was what was missing I felt a bit discouraged doing book reviews because it felt like no one is actually cared or or interacted with it or read the books but I'm told now that a lot of people actually did which i think is really cool I feel so will fault myself because I think in this pursuit with t-series I've been to focus on the numbers and just pushing that narrative which has been fun but I also kind of miss just doing whatever I feel like or whatever I actually have a more personal interest in so anyway that's it that's it for book review I hope you guys enjoyed I know these are very long and very different but I hope it's fun anyway see you guys tomorrow good bye", "label": "G"}, {"data": "so this is it this is the first look at the new MacBook Pro 15 inch with touch bar let's have a peek no I'm just kidding that's my old broken this is the this is the new one right here you see what's up you got my package run I'll be a punishment I'm your package right here I'm looking forward to this one yeah is he nice that that's me nice thank you it's always a pleasure man ah always a pleasure my brother I just adjusted the white balance I hope that's not too annoying hey hi so this is my review out it's more of a comprehensive first look at the new 15-inch MacBook Pro with touch bar notice things were almost fully Specht out I got the 2.9 gigahertz processor which is the better one and then I got one terabyte of storage which is the middle level but I got the souped-up 460 graphics card so this is almost as high as it comes this thing was like 3500 bucks first a little context now for the most part I make a living entirely by making videos and after the camera the most important tool when making videos is the computer that I edit those videos on now this thing right here this r2d2 garbage can looking computer right here this is the most specter the most expensive computer that Apple makes this is the Mac Pro with every option selected this thing costs as much as a used Toyota it's supposed to be like the world changing supercomputer and it's the worst machine I have ever owned I literally have this thing set up on this amazing monitor right here everything ready to go and all I use this computer for is for data management these are my hard drives here and I manage all that data on this machine the computer is really that bad but this desk right here I have my laptop now prior to the MacBook with the touch bar this was the best MacBook you could buy and this thing's amazing I travel the world with this I added all of my videos on this this is a workhorse it has never let me down and this this is probably my favorite computer I've ever had it's been really great for me now I have only had this for like less than a day let me tell you what I liked about it right off the bat first it's lighter and thinner than that other one and that's a big deal for me since I skateboard home with it in my backpack every single day weight is a big deal number two the hardware itself this thing is aluminum and as sexy a machine as you would expect from Apple the keyboard people complain about because they want it to be clicky this thing is super clicky loved the keyboard so it is this sort of futuristic spaceship feeling machine that you want to hug and show to your friends and go order like your hipster coffee shop and be like look at me I got the new one now let's get into my concerns and and I got a lot of them I don't know how founded the arcs I haven't really gotten into this thing yet but I'm not a cynic just hear me out the logo doesn't light up this lights out see lights up no no lights up okay let me get back to the review first when you fork over three and a half thousand dollars to buy one of these you don't just have to buy the Machine you also have to buy this year dongle a dongle or as Apple calls them an adapter is the only way you can plug in any USB thing to this which is a huge deal everything is USB this ain't got no USB ports in fact this is almost no ports at all which brings me to our biggest issue about this thing no SD card Drive SD card is the kind of memory that is used in every camera I use and it's very good on the other computer out of the camera into the computer because this doesn't have that port I there's a dongle now I could use this dongle to this other dongle but instead I bought this thing does that read on Amazon that it was pretty good and that's D card reader I have to remember this thing for additional USB things I have to remember this if I want to plug in my external hard drive I have to use this so these three dongles are now three dongles that I'll always have to have with me if I want to use this computer in the way that I used my previous computer with no dongles I just said the word dongle five times my next big gripe with this now how many of you have ever had your notebook go flying off its work surface when somebody caught your power adapter cord in their foot right whether it's your pet or your kid or your roommate well this is gonna end that that meant no matter how hard your charging cable is yanked on it would just come right off no damage no problem it was also very easy to plug into this magnetic now look Apple I believe you that this USB 3.0 or whatever this is called is faster and better but just because this can transfer files better doesn't mean that my two-year-old daughter is going to trip over my power cable any less just kidding this is my old broken laptop next I want to get into the benchmark feature of this new laptop which is the touch bar it's basically like a long thin touchscreen at the top of the keyboard I don't know how useful it's going to be and honestly this far along Apple I would have expected you to come up with the smarter means of data entry for these laptops what I mean by that is like when I want to edit a photo and I want to do it quickly I don't want to use Adobe Photoshop or Lightroom I just send it to my cell phone and I use Snapseed and what I can edit it using my fingers in pinch and zoom in Pokhara it's much easier faster and more fluid than using a mouse and keyboard to take that even further as a video editor I feel like there's a tremendous opportunity for a touch interface around a professional video editing suite maybe this is a little further down the road in the future but still now perhaps this touch bar is a step in that direction maybe it's a half step to get us there which I'm all about but when I look at what Microsoft is doing and I don't really use Microsoft computers but I look at what they're doing trying to merge their desktop operating system with a touch interface it looks like they're trying to push the envelope when it comes to how you interact with the data on your screen maybe third-party developers will do interesting things with it but for now it's more like a dynamic set of function keys then it has another way to like truly interact with your machine so that's it those are my thoughts maybe I'll give up better with you like after I've been able to use this thing for a few weeks the short it is like I am super super excited about this machine but that's just because I like new toys I'm also super bummed about the port situation in the dongle situation oh by the way Apple I don't know how or why but I ordered one of these in one of these and you accidentally sent me two of these in two of these and I checked my credit card statement you didn't charge me for four so I didn't open them if you want me to send up let me know otherwise I'm keeping them thank you for that I don't know this this thing with all the ports and the dongles I do think it's a big deal I don't think I'm just being whiny about it I know you were the first scare of the CD the disk drive you were right you're always introducing a newer faster way like firewire over USB back in the day but this this seems like a big leap everything is USB and nearly every consumer camera is an SD card so doing away with those like you're you're making my life as a professional user of your professional a little bit harder and it's not like a half step or something have to get used to it's like when you want to teach the kid to swim it's ok to throw them in the pool and they have to figure out how to swim to this side but this situation it feels more like you're kicking me off the deck of the Titanic saying swim to the nearest iceberg it's gonna be hard that's it thank you for watching my technology review I'll see you next time Apple comes out of the new laptop", "label": "G"}, {"data": "all right he hasn't seen me yet is right there [Music] my pleasure six hours 17 minutes I've heard yes that is unusual bit long we're flying it - it's wrong so it's

onto that boat it's taking me to Nantucket where I'm meeting the family for our summer vacation which I'm incredibly excited about [Music] and maybe the best part of all of this is that Candace and Francine are already there waiting for me but now I get to go see them almost there we have almost made it the island I cannot wait to see Candace and Francine [Music] yeah they are if I see you hi Freddie I'm gonna pull over over there [Music] now Nantucket Nantucket was amazing it was Candice and the baby and Owen and me the whole family there we stayed in a friend of Mines like family like guest house situation it's a special place there and we spent a lot of time at the beach and just hanging out it was just really amazing family time in a really special place and then the last thing that I wanted to share with you the reason why I took a little break from uploading is that my my grandmother died and it's it's sucks it's sad she's my last grandparent last living grandparent and yeah I don't know I when things like that happen when you lose someone especially a family member I for me it's just always a time to like pause and stop and appreciate what what's most important to you in life and I'm not angry she lived a very full life she's an old lady she's almost 90 when she died but I'm mostly he's like sad for my mom you know I lost a grandmother but I saw a couple times a year and and I'll miss her and it makes me sad that I'll never see her again but my mom lost her mother and that's that's I couldn't imagine so so we spent some time with my mom and I don't know that's what that's what the last little bit of time has been like for me so it was both like it's this juxtaposition of like celebrating life and family and summertime and all the things that are wonderful in life and then on the other side is sort of something really sad and difficult in life all right that's it start end and kind of a down note but yeah I'll see you tomorrow I always say that but I will I'll see you tomorrow [Music] you", "label": "G"}, {"data": "[Applause] [Music] 11:12 p.m. on a Saturday night I am I am I'm driving from New York City to Philadelphia Pennsylvania right now all by myself [Music] I'm here for like 12 hours and I'm here for one reason only thank you I'm here just tomorrow morning at 7 a.m. is the Philadelphia Marathon and I'm only gonna run the half marathon but I just kind of have this itch to do a race and well I love Philadelphia and Here I am [Music] five five and a half hours of sleep then on the half marathon [Music] right it's just after 6:00 a.m. I got to get downstairs meet like them organizers that give me the number for the race but it's morning time it's go time [Music] [Applause] all right this is it the race starts in like seven minutes or no seven twenty twenty two minutes I'm feeling good I'm not trying to break any records today I'm not trying to do a personal best my goal is to do like an hour and thirty minutes which would be great but I want just a nice good race I haven't raced in so long I'm definitely like a little bit nervous and weird but I'm super excited [Music] [Music] [Music] we're in route to the starting line now this is chris chris is the one who made to hook this up other I didn't have a bib yesterday I tweeted at him he's an ambassador for the say Western I know [Music] from New York [Music] [Music] first my Lindsay [Music] we [Applause] but Jesus way the bells were ringing out Christmas Day ha ha one more mile one more [Music] alright 128 piece of cake look to me [Music] we you know I almost didn't run today because what a pain in the ass coming all the way to Philadelphia is but but I'm glad I did and when I was out there is reminded of what makes running such a special sport in racing such a great part of that sport see I wanted to run a 130 today and I ran a 128 which means I did it I won and that that's the magic of running races that you're only ever competing with yourself all that matters is that how did you do how did your results compare with your goals well as your time I don't know like 210 what is your goal on 210 all right yep yep can I yeah so the whole time I'm running that race whether I'm like passing some dude or this grill burning by me I'm just looking at all these people and I'm thinking to myself champions they're all champions so if you've ever considered running or ever considered racing know that no one gives us how you fare compared to everybody else all that really matters is how did you do compared to what you wanted to do so that feels for me that's that's a special thing [Music] don't you [Music]", "label": "G"}, {"data": "[Music] Kenneth and I are headed to our therapy our couples therapy session right now and I had an idea that I wanted to talk to you about and get your opinion on we're thinking about doing a podcast a Casey and Candice podcast that's like I don't know like an hour long or a half an hour long or something and calling it the title of the best part calling it therapy where it's just us talking there probably is but we can just make ours bigger and better and then crush the competition so let us know you think like that's a terrible idea just write terrible idea below if you'd be interested at all well the only thing is I'm tired of hearing the comments that I'm such a like bitching a dud I think people [Music] we're at therapy now but that's the idea let us let us know what you think we finished therapy how do you think today went today in therapy we talked about having more children and whether or not we want to move to California we should do the podcast the laws [Music] who are you taking your clothes off nice box because Joe to Billy love Billy NYC calm and by Candice's new cashmere sweater it's a little expensive for my audience honey $180 for pure cashmere bye honey great girl great girl check this out ready I want to I want to show this to you so get it got a screw here got a string here and on the other end there's like this pin that can be used to remove SIM cards I have permanently attached this to my desk now this may seem like a nothing but you know I change cell phones all the time and getting that little SIM tray out as a nightmare on my phone here oh and I want to get my memory card out to offload all the videos and stuff it's hard to get out and I can never find this thing and now look it just lives here this is exciting for me [Applause] I'm gonna be premiering a new video that I made that I've been working on for a long time I'm gonna like put it in this vlog it's like a four minute video to be part of this vlog you see one thing I want to do a lot more of on this channel is talk about creators other critters that I really like that I think you should follow that I think maybe you'll be interested in and the video that I made is about my friend Chantal who you've seen in this show before and she just started youtubing so I want to premiere her new movie on my channel even though it's gonna live on her channel I want to use in this channel and I want to use like this big audience that that this channel has to talk about smaller creators she's brand new she doesn't have any subscribers and to talk about other people that I think are doing amazing things in this platform and try to sort of elevate them a little bit shine a little spotlight on them so this is uh this is my friend Chantal Chantal is a fine artist do you go by that visual this all this find all this and the reason why I like Chantal so much as an art the reason why I like her as a person that's cuz she's cool the reason why I like her as an artist is because her only instrument her only actually have her entire art career was built with a pan just a pen look this is this is my apartment and then this is I have one of chantels paintings in my apartment that's Francine in my apartment a couple years ago had a studio here but we were friends before that yeah she had one of the best studios she had one of the studios in this feeling that has skylight you almost took it I was gonna take it it's just like four flights away I don't want to go up all those stairs I've always wanted to make a movie about Chantal and her artwork and who she is because she's such an interesting human being and we were kind of given the excuse actually from Sam are you gonna stick with that - oh yeah this is one of Chantell stickers we were given the opportunity because of Samsung you know part of their like creator creator initiative is enabling us to make movies and they were willing to sort of produce a case you nice that movie about Chantal Martin and I'm gonna premiere that movie I'm wondering where I should drop it let me finish let's finish okay let's finish an and it'll play cool I'm reviving my old youtube channel that I started probably 10 11 12 years ago right at the beginning and I forgot I had it actually one thing that I will say about Chantal is she is fearless about trying new things it's like I see everything is a blank canvas so you shouldn't be afraid of it you should flip that switch and then just use it as a challenge and create whatever you want how did you meet Kendrick Lamar still in Miami last year how did you meet Puff Daddy he came to the show I had a few years ago he probably doesn't remember okay so without further ado I'm good this is the world YouTube premiere of a Chantel by KC video it's like three minutes long but I'm really excited you're the first people to see this ever ready 3 2 1 so what's the point in making our the point is to make so you can share so you may concern your making sure you make your share I'm Chantal Martin and I draw I'm drawing on canvases I'm drawing on walls I'm going on cars and drawing on shirts and drawing on shoes 99% of that is done live when you're drawing live you have no time to think you have no time to hesitate you have no time to plan you have no time to be anyone else so this is the cover of the home and garden section and it's it's funny I didn't know it was a big deal at the time so I only bought one copy so you have an extra spare copy out there I take it I remember my art teacher telling me Chantal don't apply for art school because you're not good enough and you won't get in at that point people were only telling me what I couldn't do so I ran away I started my career in Japan in a culture that was craft based in a culture where people learn things and practice things over generations over long periods of time and I remember thinking to myself what can I master in my lifetime what could I become a family confident with what about a lie you know I draw I love drawing we all drop though with these these I'm gonna draw like this what kind of hard work and patience would it take so that when I draw a line is recognizably mine moving to york was very humbling because if no one knows who you are they don't care who you are and everyone is an artist and you start to lose your you start to lose your way and so I decided well I'm not gonna not make up because you won't show it I'm gonna draw maybe the well my canvas and I'm gonna lose any drawing tool that I can get my hand I'm gonna draw and villager on just give me a pen and I'll make something [Applause] we follow the pen and we're allowed to allow it to go wherever it needs to go wherever it wants to take you you are a William passenger [Music] and now you repeat that and you repeat that and you repeat that you repeat that but over time you get to extract what you look like over time you get to extract what your line feels like something that is recognizably yours we have this contact between our head and our pan it doesn't matter what industry you're in it comes down to drawing it comes down to that initial mark that you make and without this pen I wouldn't have traveled I wouldn't have collaborated this tool has allowed me to discover who I am [Music] did you like our movie we're good we worked really hard on that I hope you enjoyed it what are you most nervous about when it comes to being a youtuber I think what I'm most nervous about is continuously making and sharing and pulling out stuff that I'm proud of and putting out stuff that you're proud of to you make in your share and you make you gotta making sure making sure making sure making sure all right I'm gonna link Chantal shadow before below check it out she's new there's not a lot of stuff up there yet but it's happening I'm a big supporter and a huge huge fan and I hope you guys will but you should sell those stickers you could bank all your entire you sticker packs coming soon coming soon [Music]", "label": "G"}, {"data": "[Music] well welcome to another tech review better than the game II said I tried to write this without looking at it and then I tried to use this and this is going to be a technology review I know not all you like my tech reviews so if you're not into tech reviews or whatever just like I'll let you know when I post some non tech review okay now that they're gone last week I got really frustrated because my mega phantom camera lens broke I wasn't frustrated cause it broke I break a lot of stuff I was frustrated because Canon refused to fix it even though I tried to pay for them to fix it and I threatened to finally switch from Canon to Sony something I've resisted for a very long time my favorite my all-time favorite if I totally favorite vlogging camera and this is is this year Canon ATD before the entity was the 7d both great cameras the reason why I like them so much this flip out screen is everything when shooting vlogs you can see what you're filming you can pick the focus that's why I'm always stuck with this camera check out how many of these things I've got by the way this is my collection of ten and a TVs those are all of the ATVs that I bought while I was vlogging 11 Canon eighties those are all the lenses I went through those are all the microphones I burned through when you're shooting daily videos you just accidents happen you break things you're tough on these if you slow down to treat these like they're precious you miss the shot I will say since I stopped daily vlogging are broken exactly zero cameras because like I can be more careful and responsible now all those cameras that's the price of turning out a new video every day seven days a week for like five or six hundred days straight in any bet back to my technology review the Sony cameras in this box all right the sony a7s mark - Wow nice cameras truck battery bug battery - this charger a loser and that's it [Music] that's the thing for the straps on why I just have like a six thing that looks like that why would you have a the microphones going to pick that alright so just to quickly test this out and trying to figure out the operating system it's really different from the cannon that I'm used to using I'm going to take this outside and just do some one okay going on now very next shot is going to be on the new Sony camera ready all right this is the new camera this is just terrible weather right I don't know it looks like this doesn't have that front-facing screen I was talking about step weather outside was just bad really bad this is the new camera I'm shooting on it right now ah this is what it look like compared to my Canon 5d Mark 4 which typically gets just exact shot all right here's some other shots from outside I wasn't happy to be outside all right here are some glorious cyber shots on my new Sony a7 the worst weather I could have possibly picked to do outdoor tip he's character waterproof by the way all right initial thoughts not even looking at the image I know this thing yield an incredible picture I thought so many youtubers use it also the form factor of this like small in metally and just awesome this is feels really robust and I like everything about the hardware but why would you not put a touch screen on this literally to get this to focus just like tap tap tap tap tap tap why not just touch the screen like on so many of your competitors devices in on every cell phone ever made like why would you not do that what are you thinking and Sony a lot of youtubers use this thing this is like the go-to camera for vloggers these days why not just help the thing about being able to look at yourself in the monitor when you blogging is something that our describe is like first-person filmmaking and what that means is both the narrative like the subject is first-person it's about the person creating it and then the the production I'm also the person making the movie and when you can see where you're shooting it sort of has this soulless quality to it information I'm super excited about this new camera it's fun to have something outside of the sphere of what I've been working with the last decade I will be eating a lot the main reason why I got it for videos like this that I should here in the studio to leverage its 4k and autofocus and general awesomeness so that's it I feel like I feel like I'm on all my tech reviews this one's like one of the less good ones thanks for watching [Music]", "label": "G"}, {"data": "Oh day 370 eyes and there [Music] [Applause] [Music] today's a kind of exciting day because well this morning is the Samsung

borders on ridiculous ready you can fit a small family down here this is just the leg reading situation if you were 7 or 8 feet tall you couldn't use up all this legroom if you were a circus clown wearing stilts you couldn't use up all this legroom so there are these little lights these little lights in the carpet look I found a TV situation here is amazing you get one gigantic screen right there that's like I don't know 35 inches 40 inches something like that that's one TV and then you've got another thing over here but these two aren't connected so on your big TV you watching Pulp Fiction and then on the iPad here you can do other stuff here we can see what happens with this I don't need anything I just wanted to see if this worked nice to see you this is so unnecessary thank

anything like that I didn't bring any suits so I so I just put my skateboard in here then kind of under the TV there's this big Locker and this one's pretty massive I've got my backpack in here but you can probably put a rolling suitcase or it's big you know like put my head in here [Music] [Music] I think I think I'm done with this portion of the meal it was very good I couldn't finish it I was too much stuff staking a few bit of the sunset but not a lot of it if you want to be fantastic so what are these these are just like TV screens so these are just like LCD screens of what's going on out there those are cameras where look like Oh now this isn't the long-haul flight of the a380 which has the showers and the gigantic spa on it but this is a nice bathroom is it very comfortable I

scooted about a loopy scoot what's up I'm gonna Graham never settle for less man yo I'm saying loopy scoop are you smoking a joint right now so there's this one thing I do in the summertime in New York City and I I think of it all year long and I do it every sunny warm day in the city in the summer and it's stupid but it's this it's not running you already know how happy running mix let's eat five miles from from my house and where I start there are these rocks and I get to these rocks and it's hot it's like scalding hot like a hot to the touch hot but I just lay here and I just cook and I close my eyes but I just kind of like meditate and think and focus for like 20 minutes maybe it's the heat or the Sun I don't know what it is but this is a kind of focus I can never find in life and then when I get so hot I can't take it anymore run five miles home and then I start my day but I start my day feeling like fresher and newer than I've done anything else I love it I have a cut I have a joke okay go you want to hear the guy who curse I did you hear about the guy who got his left side shot off his list no I didn't hear about the guy got his left side shut up oh it's fine he's alright now they save it that's gonna break that thank you I'll see you later all right it's tech review Tuesday and I have an idea wait I've got a question my intro a secret no question mmm in the video that you posted the other day you were like really like sad and upset you were like crying mmm this is me and me being honest but I didn't understand why you were so upset was it really about one video or is there something deeper that you need to talk about I don't know if I'm going through a downer either I'm up oh I'm down this note like there's no middle ground that's just me I'm like one of those deeper dudes you know wait are you down right now no I'm up I think are you bummed out we like talk if you know we're not to make videos no Bria I like to make videos okay so here's my idea since today's tech review Tuesday Dan I was thinking instead of like just reviewing a piece of hardware I have an idea every great TV show uses the same intro to every episode like so I want to have a more consistent intro for this show that's going to be the new three six eight intro and I'm going to show you how I do it what equipment I use and that's gonna be tech Tuesday what do you think oh I think it's good all right so what's going on right here is we put a cell phone with time-lapse mode into this spinny it's called a camel app egg timer it's an egg timer cost 25 bucks then you turn your cell phone on to time-lapse mode you hit record it spins and captures a time-lapse it's amazing it's dirt cheap it looks like [Music] so that shot light captures New York City it captures the movement that happens here and that'll make up one tiny piece of this new cinematic oh good I'm getting on the boosted board okay we're shooting something right now that's like a moving time-lapse in front of one of my favorite restaurants in New York City Previn here is gonna shoot it he's really good at this stuff and basically I stand still the camera moves around me and it's this time-lapse but it's a really dynamic effect you go to stay behind so now we're gonna go get that exact shot in like two or three more locations and stitch them all together so it feels like a 360 all right so we're gonna finish the 360 so what we just shot was a 180 around me and now we're gonna do the 360 around we were going to do this in front of juice press so it looks like that Kinect on 180 and a 180 and you've got and then you've got a full circle and a juice for Dan I've gotten to know Casey pretty well and he doesn't do well standing throws this is gonna be kind of hard for him dude am I not in the shot I'm pretty sure what do we do we go just now yeah it's Ibiza he's a sweat marks from a hard-working South African male man you notice there's like a lot of friendly faces in New York City today more than I've ever seen you [Music] [Laughter] talk me through this last effect we're going to be doing here so imagine an infinite zoom slowly but then you just chop off the in and out points I don't understand what you're talking about there's nobody I understand what you're talking about so like no no let's just show show it again dad how are you do that getting hit by a car really he's doing a really long zoom zero then we're gonna do another zoom down there I start connecting the zooms together so you look like it's zooming zooming forever done guys so now we go one block closer do the same shot when we stitch all these together oh it's right here okay then looking good okay so this is going to be shot number two shot number two of either three or four to take us like a half a mile down Broadway right to the studio all right so this is three of four Darren green light green light green light [Music] [Laughter] it's a red light myself it doesn't even matter

phase [Music]", "label": "G"}, {"data": "what do you think you do I want one of these I don't know if your own yet i've been waiting for something like this what else we got to get you to school go out the door the door i was outside time for school now working know what are you doing that you couldn't happen i have a very fun morning today so on the only to a press event right now like to have a bunch of members the media there and then out something important this press event is for one of my favorite companies yeah now I know there are now two drone today but i don't know what is inside of your right hand side and you lock up on that casey matt was for community is it to thank you very much the event hasn't actually begin yet they gotta punch it groans over here but stuff we've already seen a lot of industry folks here some members of the media free coffee but no snacks i'm not gonna make a big deal out of it but there are no snacks I mean it's not that big deal Wow hey Casey what's up dude if I had we like a high it's good to see you it's good to see you as well maybe one controlling let's thrown together i'll be so much fun this is about to pop off launch event will commence shortly but now i'm excited to tell you that that technology can effortlessly did in this backpack that's actually not got back I like to just to rely on me so I'm simply going to tap to take off why Wow DJ I just launched everything I've ever wanted in a drone maybe first off you a comprehensive review ok now for the comprehensive review pretty cool full disclosure as always I'm not hired i'm not being paid by DJ I to make this video is not an endorsement or an advertisement for their product if it sucks i'll tell you it sucks alright so this is it this is the drone with a battery put it fully extended but where it gets interesting is what happens when you fold this thing up this is the entire drone right here this is it this is the whole thing it's tiny maybe it might even it literally fit can you see that it literally fits in my pocket this is the drone now despite the fact that it fits into my pocket which makes me feel like I'm living in the future it I it doesn't feel like a toy it doesn't feel plastic it doesn't feel cheap this feels more like a transformer like a Michael Bay movie prop heavy solid secure mentally not cheap or light or plasticky that one thing that's super cool about this is that you never have to take the propellers off see this is what they look like you even have to spread them apart like that the centripetal force once this thing starts spinning aligned perfectly on the Phantom for that was one of the you always have to click them on or clip them all top two arms folded out like this and then these bottom two arms they fold down like this it's a the design feels nothing short of just genius I'm telling you like a transformer from the future also even though the DJI phantom 4 is my main drone this thing is a joke and I've told them that I don't really understand the wind holds onto your phone is like feels like it was tacked on it it feels way way bigger than it needs to be it's just not a very ergonomic were like practical controller I don't understand why this thing needs to be show cute look at this controller is the same size of this trip but the new controller that this thing the last hardware comparison i want to do before i start playing with this thing is comparing it to the Phantom for this is the mattock and this is the Phantom 4 I mean the size differences astonish it alright this is like the stupidest thing to do but well I've never flown a drone in this studio that either getting hurt or breaking the drone but they really went on and on about how this thing can fly well indoors so I'm going to give it like a a quick dry yeah wow there's no GPS in here and he's just start the controller are you seeing this look at cgi it's just staying there in perfect position it's a miracle God is out region yeah yeah oh hi that was highly impressive it just went up in state in the exact position so how these things work outdoors is they use a satellite GPS to nowhere to stay but when they're indoors there are no satellites it's just like.how okie dokie time for some real-world test here now first of all no backpack carried in this little pouch thing which honestly is an official DJ I pouch but i'll never use this pouch again doesn't need all this extra like Patti and fluff now the setup arm out arm out arm down arm down drone down alright powering up ok shits on controllers on never connect calibrate calibrate this is always such a buzzkill ok here we go ready to fly eat somebody help me fill you some help so they were about you in trouble well this is a different here it's more deserted out here so the cops will come out here to bother you there Sean head in it might help your film yet let's do this the first boy to the DJI Matic pro in the wild not my office yeah it's gone Wow feels good so far where is it ok the control feels really responsive actually prefer this controller to the phantom 4 controller i feel like i've got much more precision control the image is more narrow than it is on a phantom-like it's not as wide like the GoPro is which is I like the wide angle but i'm sure we have a better image it's far from me right now it's very far and it is handling this like a champ alright I got a warning and said hi wind velocity this thing's tiny how it can handle this wind i don't know if the image if the image that when i look at my computer if it's if it's seventy-five percent as good as the phantom 4 i'll never use the phantom 4 again got stuff just nice having this tool display because then the phone becomes a monitor and up here becomes all the critical battle is an extremely complicated maneuvers feel the wind here the wind i'm going to try to land in the wind see the win with he has studied it in our now you landed yeah haha haha so psyched about it being there no wow but this review for this thing is that if the video that I'm about it the video that's all this is even close to what the phantom 4 look like this will be my new favorite drone and what I think is the best phone i've ever seen No yeah that might be the coolest piece of camera equipment i'd ever use I want to address the skeleton and apply within the GoPro karma vs DJ I mavet I haven't had much time with the GoPro so i have no the form of firm opinion on it but I with the GoPro karma is not just a drone it's an entire system with the hand so I don't think it's apples to oranges but they're definitely playing in st. playing the same problem in the same pool soon they both exist in the same world so will be interesting", "label": "#"}, {"data":

terrible I gotta get on this plane [Music] would like to welcome you does it work you later thank you so that's it I'm back in New York City now still unsure what's gonna happen with our family trip but uh tune in tomorrow to find out you", "label": "G"}, {"data": "[Music] ten mil it's a super big deal I mean ten million subscribers ten million god you know I I when I started on YouTube the idea of 10 million seemed absolutely infallible I mean 10 million subscribers 10 10 million thanks guys I I just wanted to make this quick video to acknowledge 10 million and just to talk for a sec you know this isn't I I can't make a real video right now I've actually taken a little bit of time off from YouTube so I'm dealing with some kind of heavy personal right now but I did want to talk about 10 million what it means getting to getting to 10 million was absolutely not as hard as getting to a million you see between a million and ten million it just meant doing more of the same little bit of patience and a lot of hard work getting to getting to a million get into a million was not as hard as getting to a hundred thousand subs I saw the work people were responding to I made more of that I experimented I worked on building an audience I did all that and it took me from 100k to a million see getting to a hundred thousand subs was still not as hard as getting to ten thousand subs you see getting to ten thousand subs is the hardest thing to do on YouTube because at 0 nobody's tuning and nobody cares and at ten thousand it means you've built a meaningful audience so getting from zero to 10,000 finding your footing building a foundation on YouTube was the hardest thing to do and the moral of all this is that I think one piece of advice that people love to overlook especially young people enthusiasts energetic young people on YouTube love to overlook is patience it's something that my friend Gary Vaynerchuk talks about a lot but it's it's required to succeed in anything but especially on YouTube it's patience 2010 years they got a decade ago I started my youtube channel how old were you a decade ago like six the other big part of I think the other big part of when I look back at my success and what I've been able to do on YouTube the other big part has been you the audience and you know I have said before and I stand by this that I I think inspiration is highly overrated I think inspiration is just what takes you from zero to one and then to go from one to ten million is a combination of hard work and luck and all these other factors and I think the word inspire the word inspiration is wildly overused especially in this like sort of yippee social media world about inspiring others and here's an Instagram photo of a concern set aren't you inspired but that's not to say that inspiration doesn't play a role so I thought rather than just me sitting here bloviating about inspiring others or whatever I thought that I would share with you someone that I draw like an insane amount of inspiration from someone that I check in on every single day someone that I've never met I mostly follow him on Twitter and let me just show you this guy all right this is this is Dre Dre represents everything I love about social media [Music] all right so Dre is a guy I don't know him I just found him on social media but Dre's a guy who started I think 79 days ago he changed his Twitter handle to Dre the new me is coming and every day he posts these videos of himself just busting his ass working out to reinvent himself physically and he puts himself out there in a way that's so accessible and and anyway I'll link his YouTube channel I'll link his Twitter below just check this guy out but the reason why I'm singling out Dre today is because I think the magic of YouTube the magic of social media is its ability to bring people together and typically the only time mainstream outside whether its news media or any media attention gets shined on YouTube typically it's about something negative not something positive but for me it has been that positivity and it's been the connectedness and it's been the way that YouTube has opened up my world and be exposed to somebody like Dre I would never be able to find someone like him if it weren't for social media that is one of my like profound unrelenting love for YouTube and social media comes from all right that that's kind of it ten million uh I made this 10 million t-shirt because I think it's awesome it says 10 million here in my handwriting and then down here when you flip it up it says we did it summer 2018 and it says it says we not it says we not I did it because I just make the videos this community grew to 10 million because of because of you because of weed that's why it says we it's a great shirt it comes in black and white and I'm doing a super limited run of these shirts we're not gonna make that many but there's this young lady named Mari copening she's 11 years old she was in Flint Michigan I learned about her fundraiser this morning and I did all this research on this extraordinary young lady doing amazing things the hell her community and her most latest initiative here is to help fill up backpacks for kids who maybe can't afford school supplies and according to this GoFundMe it cost four bucks for her to fill up a backpack with all the supplies that youngster needs so for every one of these shirts were able to sell I'm gonna donate four bucks straight to her nonprofit she's looking to get to $50,000 she's currently at $28,000 I'm hoping that this will push her over the line of course if you'd rather donate instead of buy this shirt that's a great idea I'll link that below her link will also be on shop Casey Neistat comm and if there's any chance you're seeing this video mari keep up the good work I I can't wait to vote for you for president someday okay ten million I'll be back very soon once all this personal stuff blows over but thank you for what ten years of support and I have no intention of stopping or slowing down anytime soon [Music]", "label": "G"}, {"data": "[Music] special running guests this morning I can see him he's right over here

like if you want to come with us you then I talked to this guy his name is Kenny awesome dude he owns an airplane company they own a bunch of small black private planes and he was like if you want a plane to go somewhere let me know are you kidding me so the big announcement is that we're taking a plane oh you're not that far we're not going that far you know you see over to Connecticut like every weekend if you with family and all that we don't go anymore we're gonna go back to Connecticut to visit my parents but we're gonna like stay and we're gonna do like a nice weekend or like a vacation weekend for like a day but whatever but we're gonna take a plane there which is gonna be amazing I mean this technically is not a paid advertisement but I mean he's letting me fly in his plane Kenny's companies called wheels up if you want to check it out I'm very very excited about this we're leaving Friday we're bringing the baby we're trying to see if we can bring a friend because there's room in a plane it's like a flying SUV I'm also just so looking forward to getting away cuz like I did that political video this week which I stand by I'm glad I did it but whole leaf people just went nuts in the comments my god I'm voting for 1k if you're not voting for the same person as me I disagree with you but I'm not gonna judge you as a Prasad no ill-will toward you that's like I'm a human being whatever but like Wow I expressed my opinion and I'm passionate about it and like the things people say [Music] been getting a lot of questions lately about the annex this is the annex yeah this is like an extension of my studio it's a second studio it's just down the hall from my studio and the idea with this space is like I wanted to be able to do more and produce more and expand the different kinds of content and stuff so I got this space I haven't updated you in a while but it's here it's like fully functioning now Olli right here what's up Bali Ali's working on production already doing back here has been on logistics but he's slowly shifting into production now and like we're just doing kind of weird experimental stuff in here all right but some cool stuff is like there are no windows here it's just a grocery shop way so Dylan put these plants they're fake but these plants there and then put lights behind them so it almost gives the illusion that there's both nature and light outside there's no nature or light outside and no the floor has not collapsed yet I know that there was a lot of concerns and I had a number of architects and construction workers emailing me telling me this is not structurally sound it's good we're strong up here the short of it though is that the annex is serving its purpose and serving it well for those that are new here mailtime is a segment I used to do like every week where people viewers would send me like cool stuff that they'd make or whatever I'd open it and show it here on the blog but then I got weird cuz companies started sending me stuff just cuz they wanted me to open it and promote it which felt like transactional and I didn't like that but I did like the free stuff so I felt guilty and then I actually did work with brands would pay me to lecture it just got I haven't done in a while just about the branded content stuff I always try to be honest when I'm doing that and upfront but you know that yesterday I opened up this scooter here which I couldn't figure out how to get it to work but I called the people who sent it to me they told me how to make so I want to check out the electric scooter today but something else showed up this morning that's completely outrageous unmark box here and in this thing first there's a box that says hope this cheers you up about your lost drones yeah I lost a couple drones this week please don't put this letter in your vlog okay person will remain nameless who sent this to me I won't include your name but there's no way you can send me something this good and not expect me to talk about it dear Casey I'm 18 years old this is my attempt at creating a three-wheeled electric skateboard in this box is a homemade electric skateboard by an 18 year old kid here's where it gets funny be careful I unknowingly bought a week controller that has problems shutting the circuit off while in motion that means it will spontaneously go really fast also I didn't buy a charging port for this prototype so if you'd like to charge it there's a positive cable in the front of the skateboard behind the disconnect unscrew the wire cut my god alright he's here - looks like oh my god always a thousand pounds if you can't tell by this office or this vlog or any I really appreciate when people make things with their hands I was obsessed with making things when I was a kid I am still obsessed with making things look at this ridiculous office that I worked in but this is like this is next-level man just empty plastic bag where's the controller man okay no big deal the operation is just slightly different on this thing that it is on the boost support there's just a learning curve there I didn't mean to get that we're getting used to okay he mentioned in the letter that this was a prototype just working out the kinks so he does mention that it's a week controller as in the signal sent from the confession tape words right here off on off on doesn't respond if unless it's super super close and then it's just uh okay okay right that on keeps it going Express on okay you just is press off and then just jump off and try not to get hit by peer review and just keep in mind this is an 18 year old kid and this is a prototype my review great job yeah that's as I first try definitely the best wait wait you pump and then hit the gas yeah so doesn't go unless it's rolling dude you are a fraud on that thing I'm just waiting for something to go wrong thumbs up on the scooter gursky this thing is smooth as butter you gotta be moving the review on this for me is huge thumbs up man excellent work way to make an electric skateboard Sam what are your final thoughts on the this a lot of fun a lot of fun it is dark out almost dark out on my way home winter is here okay no big deal the operation is just slightly different on this thing that it is on the Busan port there's just a learning curve there I didn't mean to get that I hope I didn't startle you", "label": "G"}, {"data": "and then oh and did you want to get a did you want to get a little pot before I saw that that's really weird last night we get in at

summer should be here already nothing sustained hold rainy everything these guys are good thank you minutes if you're if you're a regular viewer of this show you know just how much my happiness and good mood and just general positivity is tied to the weather you'd also know that all inter long I've been waiting for summer [Music] [Music] [Music] I'm trying to illustrate a point here which is that it rains a disproportionate amount of days in New York City but as I'm making charging and looking at the data I'm realizing it rains on average 11 to 15 percent of the days kind of making me feel like a little bit of a spur complaining about it so much maybe I should have looked this up before I did this whole scene so is it pouring and outside was it pouring rain outside today seems like an opportune day to make a video I've wanted to make for a very long time called I wanted to explain to you the audience exactly how I make my vlogs like what I see as the recipe for creating these videos first a quick history lesson I started vlogging in March of 2015 now before I started vlogging vlogging was typically individuals Karen like point-and-shoot cameras there were sort of documenting their day into a camera there was a much smaller genre back then and it was pretty linear day begins here day ends there come with me throughout my day I found the genre fascinating I was obsessed with like Ben Brown I was obsessed with fun for Louie I was obsessed with bf versus GF Charles Trippy was great I think what fascinated me the most about the horizontal is the idea of using your your life as a narrative for a daily series now when I made my HBO series this is a series I did my big brother van it was on HBO in 2010 we made it in 2008 that's 10 years ago my brother and I used our lives as a backdrop for a TV show but it wasn't so daily it wasn't so episodic instead we kind of plucked interestingness out of our lives share that interestingness is tiny little stories struggle stories together and call that a TV show episode so I'm one end of the spectrum we've got your daily vloggers in 2014-2015 sharing every aspect of their daily lives into a camera and on the other end of the spectrum we got this TV show that I made a decade ago where I share our little stories from my lives as short movies so I went to Belgium in 2015 this is a month before I started vlogging and I wanted to test that one thing what would happen if I sort of vlog about my trip but instead of talking into a camera I use really precise cinematography what would happen movie like cinematography but it's just me going about my daily life going into my hotel room coming out of my hotel room [Music] [Music] and I love that video that video work you should watch it points below and that got me super excited and that's when I made the decision that on my birthday 2015 I would start daily vlogging it wouldn't be this all day long and said I wanted to figure out how to make something that felt a lot more like a movie every day so that was the thinking that's what went through my head fire is starting to vlog so we're not understanding here are the foundational principles that I apply to almost every episode of this daily almost daily vlog number one the most important thing is of course the story but what is a story here's a super basic breakdown of a story and every good story follows this rule that is the rule of a three-act narrative you've got a beginning you've got a middle you've got an end set up conflict resolution Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch a pail of water act 1 Jack fell down and broke his crown act 2 Jill came tumbling after act 3 set up conflict resolution now in some episodes that super super super literal for example my all-time favorite episode of ever made of this vlog which is called my all-time greatest is such a literal example of set up conflict resolution it just felt so good to make that there's a set up here's what happened there's a conflict oh my god what's the outcome going to be and then there was a resolution happy ending that's not always so literal in every episode but I strive for that in every episode because that is what's at the core of a well-told story and a story is what drives any video like this and that right there was sort of promise or the deal that I made with myself was never an obligation to share with you the intimacy of every day of my life this isn't a journal but instead could I find everyday in my life a three-act narrative to share now a couple of the more granular aspects I always found it kind of hard to watch non-stop shaky camera vlogs it was disorienting it was always a little claustrophobic so so what I try to do is have an equal amount of handheld locked off shots locked off means on a tripod like this and then establishing shot the wide shot so it's establishing shots let you know where I am so it feels more like you're here with me these locked off shots let you the viewer forget about the camera for a second and focus on what I'm saying in the environment that I'm in and then the handheld shots like this enable you to sort of feel the spontaneity and the urgency that is whatever is taking place in my daily life hardware is then what cameras i use I have a simple rule for when it comes to hardware and that is always use the very best camera you have at your disposal so right now I'm shooting this on my big camera I'm shooting in 4k with a nice wide lens this is a perfect shot I've got a light right there I'm trying to make myself look good this is the best I have right now but when I'm out running in the morning and I want to film my run the best I have is my cell phone I keep a point-and-shoot in my backpack in case I don't have this big camera because the point shoot is a little bit more dynamic than just the cell phone so not to hold into any certain kind of hardware or any certain quality of hardware it's what I have access to cinematography part to hold the camera steady no one wants to watch you forsake you cinematography it hurts your brain it's hard to see what's going on it's not pleasurable for you the viewer and it's not easy for me the editor to put it together if it's super shaky if it's nonsensical it's go straight in the trash what's up Marlin almost off your pocket man I'm making a movie Marlin about how to make how I make my blog really yeah like it's not so much a tutorial but it's illusion of light how do aspects of I've never really shared right so you know what you should have done usually suffered me and then taught you sit with me in teach me all to do okay the next version of Casey and I stats logging secrets will be with Marlin we're in a peach and out of law cinematography part three time lapses and drones here's something very important no one gives a about your stupid time lapses your stupid drone shots that's something I remind myself in a daily basis that kind of cinematography only works if it's serving a greater purpose and for me it serves two purposes one is transitional so you'll notice sometimes like I'm outside wrapping up a scene where I'm doing something on my skateboard the next scene I'm in my studio doing something completely different and in between there might be a beautiful drone shot of the city or might be a beautiful time-lapse of the city I'm using it to get me from one scene or one aspect of the story to the next as that it's an incredibly effective tool the other place where it works is to show the audience a broader sort of a broader image of where you are and what's taking place in time drones in particular are great for that I'm at a hotel on a cool Beach and it doesn't really work pointing my camera the drone can give you context that otherwise couldn't [Music] [Applause] it's that kind of ambitious beautiful cinematography doesn't have a relationship with the narrative even if it's just a little relationship it feels out of place and it gets boring very very fast now there is a lot more depth and complexity to it than that things like where does being positive all the time start to just sound like total BS where people don't believe it things like when I'm feeling down and I want to share with you the audience I'm struggling with something how do I do that in a way that you actually care because we've all got our own problems why so think about yours it was like consistent narratives and you know if I'm on a trip that's five day long how do I make a five day episode arced about essentially the same subject there's a lot of depth to this but I hope that this serves the good sort of introduction into some of the thinking that I've had as I do this vlog I want to end this first kind of instructional sharing video by saying this probably the most important thing succeeding whether it's in the vlog in the YouTube game or in the creative space at all is this you have to have your own thing so if you follow this video perfectly and you make the most perfect kc blogs you will have failed before you begun they don't want to see your kc blog they want to see your your vlogs they want to see what you can bring to the table my favorite thing in the world is seeing how youtubers are able to iterate and build on other youtubers styles and sentiments and ideas until they make something that's uniquely theirs those are the youtubers that really succeed so the most important rule is be original and that whole recipe that I just outlined that was what I thought I could uniquely bring to YouTube and help find success with it alright please let me know below if this is super interesting or absolutely King bull here not side now this is the beginning of act 3 star if you remember but it all so innocent I hope you remember but in all the episodes where I talk about having gone to Afghanistan as a journalist and connecting with these pararescue jumpers there was one guy that I met who's been in this vlog before named Roger sparks oh ok that Casey that's me that's Roger right there that's the man that's the TJ and there he is again that's Roger there this is an awesome black tip if you guys made for me amazing guide Roger is a part of this amazing campaign to ressort coral reefs they made a big movie about it that's the movie screening I'm going to tonight looks incredible going to show the support and to see this great movie [Music] this right place awesome Rodney dude so you guys might remember over here this is Rogers big movie this is your big movie humble here it's not a movie about me it's about the cause about health and special operations veterans and helping those most humble Nana play there it's wonderful to see your eyes oh you congratulations Oh [Applause] ah who's about to start the ocean is really the last frontier surreal combat did can't cannot really be articulated in extraordinary efforts under direct immediate danger to his own life resulted in bidding for American lives one host nation civilian and returning for soldiers killed in action to their families [Applause] movie was about taking former soldiers bringing them to help repair coral reefs I like scuba diving and that being therapy for the soldiers and then also a way to start to repair the damaged environment so it's like helping the earth and helping the former soldiers incredible story incredible story Roger is also an incredible guy I'm going to bed [Music]", "label": "G"}, {"data": "[Music] maybe see that dredger yes yet good not amazing well we're just about back neat how are you feeling right fourteen point six miles at a seven forty two pace that's a pretty serious run last week I ran 70 miles seventy miles in seven days that's one hundred and twelve kilometers it's a big week for me kind of makes me think that I should have run the marathon this year this is the first here in like five years where I'm not running the marathon you know I've run like 22 or 23 marathons if there's one thing I know is that if you're hurt you're not feeling it you don't do it but I know I'm marathon day I'm just gonna like be the most jealous guy and all in New York City okay there are like that many things did I get super excited about that's not true I get excited about everything but I'm particularly excited about this okay so every day I mean every every day on my way into work I get my juices literally every it's because if I don't have these things I'll just see garbage all day these don't last long if they're not refrigerated so I keep this down here but this I have feel like I smoked it I got a refrigerator not just any refrigerator though this is a refrigerator that's used so mothers that are nursing their babies can keep their breast milk cold without having to like keep it in the main room I'm not kidding that's how I found it on Amazon look how cute it is that's pretty good should go here [Music] fresh juice okay [Music] before I get into today's episode into today's episode I just want to address the noise situation I mean do you hear it how do you not hear that this is uh this is what goes on outside my office all day every day for the last 16 years somebody was in here somebody's smart and they're like I don't even notice the background noise I do it does bother me because I tried to provide you with content that is considered and this is so inconsiderate I did mention last week how I aspire to be a technology reviewer and I'm not very good at it I don't really know what I'm doing okay this is gonna continue in that thread a while ago I got this package that said do not open before October 18th today is I know what this is to drone as always this is not a paid endorsement and if this is a terrible product I'll let you know okay so what this thing is is this is supposed to be like an indoor handheld foldable drone that you just like throw up in the air and it takes a picture and it sits in your pocket like I don't know they like emailed me a hundred times about it but you know I totally understand why companies send me stuff like this and I totally appreciate it they want they want me to talk about it here in the vlog and it gives me stuff to talk about it's like a total win-win but I also think that there's like there's definitely a risk on the company's part because I mean if I like it I'm gonna I'm gonna tell you guys that I actually like it but if let's get into it hovercamp a sport the hover camera passport isn't an aerial drone it isn't a selfie stick very fancy packaging very impressive Tetris layout here with all the stuff actually before I fly this thing just in case I totally destroy it like I did with the last little drunk let me do a little walkthrough for you so you can see what it looks like this is the camera right here it looks sort of like a cell phone camera that's the camera on my cell phone and then that's the camera on the passport how do I show you how big this thing is this is my hand and that's how big that is but this is phantom 4 this is the passport it's tiny unfold hover cam and hold it level press the power button to start the well okay okay kind of amazing push the button [Music] [Music] all right before I take it outside I want to look at this footage so far my review the most fun drone I've ever played with all right I don't know the practical applications of this thing yet cuz I don't know if you can even fly it outside but indoors is amazing it was like crashing into the lights and everything that never fell and then when I just I grabbed it because there's no propellers ok checking out the video quality now I would describe it as like [Music] it looks like a good cell phone video camera that's what it looks like like it's pretty crispy it's pretty smooth oh another detail I did only shoot in 1080 because the 4k is not stabilized I'd rather have a 1080 picture that stabilized in a 14-1 that's shaky so far so good though I'm gonna take it outside [Music] these are not my children but I am giving them a ride on my boosted board kids love this thing is that fun [Music] after having had a chance to dive into the footage from the from the passport it's not terrible but it's not the video is not great the photos stellar video not great they did stress me quite a few times this is not like a DJI or a GoPro drone this is meant to be something for people who are casual and want a selfie and for that it's amazing I even think this could be good for like younger people or up-and-coming youtubers that just wants something that's easy and to give them some shot variety could be great it won't be replacing my phantom for any time soon but I will find a use for this is the most fun drone I've ever flown [Music] you wanna see this diary already ordered to go see this [Music] [Music] alright this is safety testing go [Music] cuff all my hair yeah that is if you suck his hand I'm terrified there's no it's good for bad hair", "label": "G"}, {"data": "you are pregnant look at you finally [Music] hey John I'm going to go to LaGuardia thank you very much have a good day sir thank you [Music] on my way to Boston for like a super quick business trip I'm going there today I'm coming back tonight change changes the theme of today's episode let me well let me begin by you we were not a little vacation this past weekend [Music] [Applause] September 1 2018 September 1 that means summer is effectively over we are here in Watch Hill Rhode Island I've been here before in the vlog this is one of my favorite places in the world this vacation no the reason why we took this vacation it's the same reason why I've taken a break from posting videos which is that Candice is due in a month in a month we're having a baby and that's a that's a lot [Music] let's our pleasure be the first to walk you to Boston Logan International Airport for the local time is it makes me think of other times in my life when there are big changes like when I got married or when when Francine was born okay good to see you sir and those inflection points you know in the moment they don't in the moment they don't feel as substantive as when you look back at them and you realize that like those terms are the terms that make your entire life [Applause] I'm holding that tight good morning [Music] because if you're cast by the water let's look at this house [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you know Owen went to college not long after Francine was born so it really has just been the three of us and and when you think of your family unit you think of it as like this a movable thing like families don't change your family is your family the only time it changes is when someone new comes into your family and we're about to have that happen in the most like jarring way it could which is by having a little baby come in and change everything so I'm here I'm here in Boston speaking at a like a marketing event called hyper growth very exciting this is my green room here look what they did ready cool I speak in about 20 minutes and then back in New York and that's a lot it's exciting that's life like that's what that's what it's all about but we really have been trying to appreciate what we've had for the last couple of years and appreciate the fact that it's all about to change and this this little trip is a culmination of that appreciation [Music] thank you very big change it's also it's all I think about straight track the airport trying to really appreciate things soak it all in change is coming you shouldn't be scared of change no while it's okay to be scared of change you shouldn't let that fear prevent you from know while it's natural to be scared of change you should never let that fear keep you from making changes a lot of change is coming up new baby okay back to New York yeah [Music] we then [Music] [Music] prego how is vacation going can you believe that our family is not going to be you me and Francine anymore crazy right welcome to New York's LaGuardia Airport the time is 5:45 p.m. please remain seated with your seatbelt fastened until the seatbelt sign is turned off and keep the aisles clear of all carry-on items [Music] and you be now with my soul before me kisses [Music]", "label": "G"}, {"data": "let me set the stage for you the year is 1994 two best friends Harry and Lloyd on a benevolent mission to return a lost briefcase to a woman they barely know halfway across the country leave the east coast of the United States and they drive right to the middle of the country to a little town called Aspen Colorado [Music] [Music] hello and welcome to a new series here at 368 called story time at 3:16 yes I did just describe the plot to the movie Dumb and Dumber see I was like 12 years old when I saw that movie I saw in the theaters and it blew my mind it still stands it's one of the best comedies ever made I saw it with my best friend Joe and after leaving that movie we decided that immediately after high school he and I both would leave Connecticut leave New England and moved to Colorado this was the vision this was our dream this is what we wanted to do it's what we talked about every day in biology class this was the plan just a couple years later and a fight with my parents they end up running away from home when I was 15 freshman in high school and I get my very first girlfriend pregnant and when this happens I've to let go of all of my lofty dreams to support my kiddo which meant surrendering that plan to move to ask [Music] it's not gonna do us any good to sit here whining about it we're in a hole we're just gonna have to dig ourselves out so my birthday is March 25th and I started 368 I started this new series this new daily vlog the first week of April I wanted to do something special for my birthday this year say I need to be the last time I could like turn everything off before before this blog kicked off and that's something that I wanted to do is realize that like 12 year old Casey dream of going to Colorado with my day one homies and just skiing and like got room for one more if you still want to go to Aspen and that was exactly what we did this is the beginning of the trip we're headed to Aspen now [Music] [Applause] first my friends that's Peter his dad my dad's best friends they were friends before we were we've known each other since before either of us were alive Andy Andy aka Chuck J he now on the same lacrosse team together in in sixth grade and I ran cross-country together in seventh grade that's the guy who taught me how to do a 360 on a BMX bike going off a dirt ramp and then Joe Joe is my number one ace homie my best friend since childhood that I was always been there for me that's Joe were there [Music] now cut out of your 1999 I live in a trailer park I wash dishes to support my family and I had a tiny little baby now I would spend all my days at home watching that baby because I worked nights and I remember a number of times joe-joe coming to sit in my trailer parking hanging out and we just sat there on the floor of my trailer playing Sega Dreamcast on my 27-inch Trinitron glass CRT television when you have very little you spend a lot of time thinking about what you would do if someday you had more means you had greater means or resources and for me it was always about doing something fun and something special for my friends who were there for me when I had nothing [Music] we see it in hotel that was raped by the base of the mountain it had an outdoor swimming pool even though there was snow on the ground [Music] you were six horses made of sticks back and she were white I was winning the fight bang bang he shot me down the ground bang-bang my baby shot me down seasons came and change the time when I got back [Music] my baby shot me down [Music] we'd wake up every morning at the crack of dawn so you'd be first on the mountain you skied the entire day and then by four o'clock we like exhausted after eight hours of skiing and we went to bed by 8 or 9 o'clock we are not high schoolers anymore they weren't we're adults we have families we have jobs we have responsibilities and as you know as you grow up and those responsibilities become and those responsibilities consume more and more of who you are the opportunities to do things like go skiing for a couple of days just for the covet those opportunities are few and far between that was never lost on us we appreciated that every second of every day [Music] I think the takeaway for me is that that was on its surface nothing more than a couple of friends going skiing but underneath that was kind of a lifetime of dreams and ambitions and friendships and fun and and memories and all those other things you Harbor and they fester in your brain this was the physical manifestation of that this was the realization of that a life not shared is a life not lived and having the same friends for decades of my life really really made me appreciate that you know 1994 is also the year that that Biggie Smalls dropped his seminal album ready to die with the smash hit juicy age-old story of coming from a place where you have next to nothing in getting to a place that that you one day dreamed of arriving at and sharing that with the people that you care about and that's what this stupid meaningless broski trip was all about see you tomorrow on three six eight on tomorrow's episode of three six eight [Music] so I

misleading but as long as you clicked the bait has succeeded okay I don't I don't I don't believe in click there's like a lot of caveats here clickbait at times can be just egregious and horribly

if you click on the title you're like this guy's foolish then I've misled you sometimes you do a really good job of this like the $21,000 first-class seat great title totally intriguing and perfectly

the next couple of days with an empty plane I know it's not a lot of flight but I wanted to offer a free ride if you're interested in going to Philadelphia maybe you're thinking like why would you fly someplace you don't need to go but a private jet is like this is like this is an empty plenty to be like it's my plane this is a Perry I'm in my lights this is a very special opportunity so yes I am getting my own private jet but I only get it for like a half an hour flight or something and I'm more like cargo than like the actual like guests on the plane but still what an opportunity I never fly

movie where I had an actual crew I had Bret I had exact it was the three of us we were focused we had like real audio and real cameras it looks beautiful and that kind of filmmaking was the filmmaking that defined my whole career before I started YouTube before I started vlogging so beyond all of the excitement that's like physically happening today the fact that the movie is now out the fact that

are getting really hard you passed a 10 mile marker there's only a 5k won five of those you need to take but now you're fighting you're going ten seconds slower per mile and then the doubt comes in maybe I'll just trip and fall I want to finish but at least I'll have a good excuse other than finishing slow maybe just a 30-second break to take a piss but one mile left but that last mile this last

[Applause] wake up so it's 4:40 two in the morning this is usually my day begins this is what my day looks like this is what everyday looks like up between 4:00 and 5:00 always up between 4:00 and 5:00 cup of coffee then I sit down at my computer this is my favorite part see it's these early morning hours that are the absolute most productive for me no phone calls no texts messages nothing's happening on social media everyone else is asleep it's just total focus that gives me between 5 &amp; 7 a.m. to get some work done 2 full hours before Francine's up when she's up we make breakfast [Music] she leaves for school at 7:30 by 8 o'clock I'm out the door on my run my run always happens for me running this alone time is top priorities back from the run before 10:00 shower shave get out door I need to work the commute to work it's fast a 5-minute ride or so I didn't know what I was going til you said turn try to always be in the office by 10:00 and then it works until I was sad yeah busy work email work phone calls work sitting my office eating in my office pass to the outside were having one 3 6 8 or meeting work meetings work meeting with this guy were talking to her was getting it done work leave the office before 6 6 o'clock headed home 6 to 10 6 to 10 is family time and it's non-negotiable babies asleep before 10 I know she should be asleep sooner were terrible parents baby's asleep at 10 I go to the gym from 10:00 to 11:00 11 o'clock I pass out Levi what time what time do you wake up no I am Number 1 just on a practical side if you wake up early in the morning like at 4:30 in the morning you're gonna have some free time to yourself to make things happen to take care of things that are important to you let's say you're the most ultra motivated guy in the world when that alarm clock goes off there's at least 50% of the time where you just met that soft little pillow is just caressing your head and you want to stay there and it takes discipline to go nope I'm gonna get up out of this bed I'm gonna do what I'm supposed to do and that discipline that you have at that moment you win that fight that's a big victory and then that that that pattern will carry out throughout the day because once you're up well now and I'm up I might as well go work out because I'm already up and I I feel good that I got up out of bed and I won that battle let me go win another battle I'm gonna go get it done and then when you show up at the office and there's someone that's got a big box of doughnuts that they're given away for free by the way so they're just sitting it's almost like an insult not to take them but when you've already gotten up early you had the discipline there you already worked out you have the discipline there and now you see the box of doughnuts you're like no I'm not gonna eat the doughnuts no no doughnuts you're not gonna do it and that discipline carries on throughout the day so now you take that and you you expand that out over a week in a month and you end up with more discipline and it starts with that simple act of getting up and getting out of bed in the morning discipline starts every day when the first alarm clock goes off in the morning I say first alarm clock because I have three the moment the alarm goes off is the first test it sets the tone for the rest of the day the test is not a complex one when the alarm goes off if you get up out of bed Ruy there in comfort and fall back to sleep if you have the discipline to get out of bed you win if you are mentally weak for that moment and you let that weakness keep you in bed you fail though it seems small that weakness translates to more significant decisions but if you exercise discipline that too translates to more substantial elements of your life okay Jacqueline let me try to butcher your bio a little bit you you were a Navy SEAL commander Lieutenant Commander in the Navy SEALs you did how many tours in Iraq I did two tours in Iraq and then you actually you actually you were a Navy SEAL instructor so then you took your learnings from the battlefield and you taught future generations of seals what you learned yeah and a lot of times when people think about SEAL instructor they think of what you see on TV or SEAL team we're here to get you out that's not actually the instructing that I did the instructing that I did was four seals that had already been through that basic training and maybe they'd made multiple deployments overseas but a seal platoon has to prepare and work together and get to know each other and learn how to function together as a team and in order to to in order to get there they go through pretty arduous training actually extremely arduous training and that was the training that I ran sometimes even if you're the most highly motivated person in the world that grind starts to beat you down a little bit and that's when you have to stop looking at the short-term thing because that's not that's not getting you to get it done and you got to look okay what is the long-term goal that I'm looking at what am I really trying to get done in the long term and you say oh you know what I'm actually waking up today early so I can be ahead of the curve so I can sell more of these widgets or whatever so I can buy a house and you know what today matters today matters this decision that I'm making right now is that first step it's me taking one stroke swimming in the right direction heading towards the shore and if I don't take this I'm not making any progress okay Chacko one piece of advice for someone who's thinking about whether it's waking up earlier just having more discipline in their day one piece okay discipline equals freedom that that's the best to keep you surprised so listen here have you written a book called that I did I did write a book it's right here yeah the discipline it was freedom we all want freedom right we all want to have freedom we want we want to have financial freedom we want to have more free time we don't have physical freedom that's what we want everyone wants freedom of course but if you want to have freedom in your life the way to get to freedom is is through discipline it's that's how you get there so if you want to be if you want to be financially free you have to have financial discipline you have to save your money you have to work hard to earn more money you have to not buy by stupid things that you don't actually need right you need to save that money and invest it properly if all that takes discipline and if you have that kind of discipline you'll end up with more freedom if you want to be if you wanna have more free time everybody wants more free time but if you want more free time how are you gonna get it you have to have more discipline time management less fortnight more work when you get done doing something that's a complete waste of time how do you feel at the end of it all right terrible yeah you feel happy while you're doing it oh this is kind of fun this is this is stimulating my brain a little bit and then you get done with it and you realize that you could have done something productive and you don't feel good about just this play this guy why buckets of cold oatmeal every day I don't care about it just it's just healthy and I feel good all day oh yeah that's that's a great example cuz everybody knows that when you're eating that cheeseburger I mean come on good but how but literally how bad do you feel 30 38 minutes when you've got done eating a cheeseburger and fries you're you're you're suffering if you are at work I yeah what about the people that blame circumstance for not being able to take ownership and build that discipline so they're just constantly like pointing outside themselves how do they like acknowledge that but no I have the opportunity right now yeah but that's that's the fundamental core of of where this is a problem is when people look around and they blame they but if they're in business they blame the market or they blame their competitors or if their personal life they being with their family they blame their parents they blame everyone else and they never look at themselves and say you know what maybe it's not this is my fault but what can I do about it [Music] I'm at a station I'm never gonna find attract surprises you stand so the question I get asked most often about my schedule is where do you find where do I find the hours like how am I not exhausted all the time from waking up so uh see your hours of the day that time time is fungible meaning you can take hours from one part of your day and move it to another part of the day so I made a decision to take two worthless hours those the hours between 11:00 p.m. and 1:00 a.m. those are like Netflix and chill hours I took those hours totally unproductive hours I moved them to 5:00 a.m. to 7:00 a.m. so what used to be totally wasted hours are now totally useful hours so now I go to bed at 11:00 but I get up at 5:00 and instead of having two hours of nonsense I have two hours of a hyper productivity first thing in the morning [Music] Jaakko has a fantastic podcast and a whole bunch of books including this new one everything is linked below go check them out this is great right uh well I guess so you said the modesty this one this is the book that I've read it's fantastic

trying to dry your hair with one of these because they will melt your hair excuse me I met you in Nashville a couple weeks ago it's the kid that was in the video from Tennessee that I was skateboarding with just a to the other side of town now I met a kid named Austin what's up Austin Austin it was awesome to meet you in Nashville thank you for the snow globe and I liked the Confederate flag was appropriated with stars in there ah real talk I don't know if you can tell but like I've been a little distracted lately extremely distracted lately I try as hard as I tend to hide that like from the vlog I don't try to hide it because there's stuff I don't want you to know I try to hide it because because I'm not at a place of it because there are things that are happening right now but they're not quite ready to share with the universe with you and that makes me feel bad so much of this so much of this vlog is predicated on honesty and like me being open and transparent with what's going on in my life in my career with you the audience and I'm definitely withholding information right now I'll be in a place where I can share very very soon but there's a lot going on and it's like a big sort of turn like a pivot or like an inflection point in my personal life and my career in my family life it's wonderful and it's positive but it's weighing your on me and it's like all I'm thinking about and the fact that I can't like sort of vent to my therapist / YouTube audience when we sort of promotes that frustration so yeah I don't mean to sort of bring things down here I just wanted to share with share with you a little bit of like what's going on with me right now that's all that's all like regular vlogs everything's staying the same nothing's changing everything's changing nothing's changing I'll just share more later [Music] when I was driving my kiddo across country to go to college we drove in a minivan or some sort of weird vehicle I brought my boosted board with me and then I lost my electric skateboard in Denver Colorado and I could not figure out what happened to it a week and a half ago I got an email from I got into Alex he works in a hotel that I stayed at and he was like I think I've got your boosted board because it has your name engraved all over it I found you on the Internet I would like to send it back to you booth said three the poky board is back why do I always write my name on everything because I always lose everything so thank you for Alex I'm gonna send you an awesome awesome thank-you gift package like send you as much love as I can you're part of everything that's right I really immensely incredibly appreciate your honesty and like the effort you must have to go through like mail it back what a pain yeah [Music] headed home early today Candis and I are leaving tonight and the baby we're all leaving tonight so a system meter at home before looks like quite frankly still isn't enough time I don't know how we're gonna we'll figure it out I don't know who's less responsible with timing stuff New York and probably me well we're both pretty bad dude so this is a six minute ride then we're at the airport between security checking in I dropped my phones [Music] hey you hearing everything so we do well Delta Delta method girl what are they do think if there's any other options Herman when I said who's worse at planning me or Candice I am we're at the wrong Airport and there's only one flight out of New York City today and it leaves in 20 minutes 30 minutes no I'm just saying that earlier I was saying I don't know who's worse that planning you or me but it's definitely me yeah so we're kind of screwed we can't do anything good to go home now we're gonna go to the other Airport now we're back in the car missed our flight we missed the other flight when it's on you're a different flight from a different Airport you know you guys always give me a hard time say I always pretend that I'm rushing and I pretend I'm gonna miss the flight sometimes we actually doing that you dumb computer answering stupid mother Jeanne agent you have coming up for three people two adults one mmm just to reiterate exactly what's going on here we went to the wrong we flew to the wrong Airport our flight was a bit it's not funny it's entirely my fault but we went to the wrong Airport so there are no flights out of this Airport so now we're going to the other Airport where we see there are a couple of flights but we don't have any tickets because it's like too soon so we're just gonna go to the airport show up there and just get out whatever a flight that I have that'll get us there or we'll go somewhere different the choices are this figure out how to go tonight to go in the morning or we don't go at all what do you think Bernsen come here I thought a night thing for the one for one second that she could fall asleep on our side say do it we're gonna get there at 11:30 which is 12:30 our time you just thrown in the towel you know I'm just folding the towel so we can open it up again tomorrow morning but you definitely wanna go tomorrow all right it's a long weekend in New York City if we don't go I could still make it to my dinner with my friends you and your ulterior motives I'm definitely not all right let's go I'm coming Francine this was nothing more than I was thinking a helicopter ride the airport and then taking a ride home which is fun one time I was responsible for getting five people on an international flight to Italy and I was driving and we all missed the play [Music] the backward is waiting for taxi now you're not mad at me are you this is kind of fun right those looking funnel just like a family trip to the airport you don't think you're supposed to be back there lady [Music] the baby's asleep Candace is out with her friend Marcy having dinner everything's cool you know the only thing about tonight that was a failure is that we didn't make our flight it was a great night we have to ride in a helicopter spending time together as a family have popcorn we are gonna leave but tomorrow morning I think [Music] I put my backpack in a garbage bag", "label": "G"}, {"data": "[Music] hey check this out hello this is Roberto Roberto is in the olympics he's a runner I got an idea quick question for today's video Roberto and I have been talking about making a movie called Casey and Roberto's guide to running for new runners or something like that if we were to make that is that something people are interested in Roberto is interested so I'm off to a super super late start today cuz last night we were recording the podcast I just got behind so it's like you know 2:00 in the afternoon right now which means I can go do my favorite thing surprise Francine as she gets out of school before she goes to dance class also could I show you my outfit today it's like nice out today like really nice out so I got on a white jumper red shirt pink pants silver shoes Candice picked out most of these clothes but I just thought nothing makes me happier then how excited then seeing how excited she gets when she sees me surprise her at school the little things like you know damn I got a question yes my sir last night at the house where Adelaide mm-hmm do you remember opening a bag of a pink bag of Hello Kitty marshmallows yes she was saving these so you did open them and before you open them they were completely unknowable right and did I do something bad those were Francine's special marshmallows for her special trip and you opened them down and you open them [Music] this camera here it doesn't have doesn't have like a flip out so I have to plug in an external monitor but there was a minor mishap last week I ganked the camera and I'm still connected to this thing and this thing just well I kinda it broke it broke in like a million pieces and one of the bits that I couldn't figure out a properly fix was the part that connected to like the the tripod mount so my fix here is just to permanently attach it to this little gorilla pod your try hot glue [Music] it's totally works okay do you know who Buster Keaton is Buster Keaton is one of my favorite like movie makers of all time he's a guy who he's a kind of started making movies in the movie business when the world of movies was where the world of like YouTube is right now meaning there was like no road map there was no like defined style or like genre you could invent things like vlogging was invented in the last five years and he invented okay whatever just watch this ready [Music] all right he really he's really doing this like he really did that those stunts are all real there's no special effects like nope that's all like he's actually doing these things and he did this at a time when like nobody knew what motion picture or moving images could be used for and this was the stuff that he would come up with in his head you know much work it must have taken for that one joke but I bring him up because there is definitely a parallel between him a hundred years ago trying to figure out what movies could be and the entire YouTube community right now trying to figure out what can be done here [Music] okay see this right here just above the beam see the beam just above the beam that is the Japanese the Japanese grocery store it's this awesome place that sells all like something you only get in Japan but they import it here but you came and tailed it came and tell it's up there look that's a coffee shop and up there where the broccoli is and that lot and those

feel like I have that calm I don't feel like I have that opportunity so this is just like a good old-fashioned update video ten things ten things I need to bring you up to speed on number one if you send me a letter or maybe or maybe a package helmet or a futuristic fan and you haven't received a thank-you from me please know that I am working on it I just I get a lot which I appreciate and it takes me a long time to get through all of these you know for what it's worth a lot of my youtuber friends told me that they've shut down their Pio boxes and stuff this just becomes too much of a hassle I do not see it as a hassle I love receiving packages in mail I just try to be realistic with update number two I haven't shaved in about a week I'm not one for facial hair but I had a really good excuse for all of the last week I've been on this like it was like a romantic because it was Candace and me but we had a bunch of our friends with us but no children no babies we left them at home with Candace's parents but I'm like this crazy wild romantic honeymoon like vacation we all went on a cruise through like the Caribbean and we stopped these islands and went for like hikes and then at night we can decide midway in almost a year and a half without the kid oh it was amazing I didn't shoot any video about it but it was such a wild experience I feel like I have to make a movie about it somehow so I might try to get all of like the cell phone clips that everybody took on that trip and turn that into a video but yeah I grew some facial hair and got this fantastic tan I'm a romantic holiday [Music] [Music] my holiday video a little bit about that video if you haven't seen it we you know every year Samsung wants me to do a big video with them and they are willing to kind of support whatever crazy idea I have and last year's about me dressing up a Santa and flying around on the snowboard behind a drone this year I want to do something it was much more about giving back if you haven't seen it we turned an old shopping mall it's like this winter wonderland then we invited like a hundred plus underprivileged kids to come there and make youtube videos with us it is opportunities like that and getting to do like that that is the very reason why I want to be a youtuber and I'm psyched to be a youtuber it wasn't just me either we had there were 18 youtubers that we flew in from like around the country around the world to help us realize this thing and you know all of it was to benefit the Boys and Girls Club which is an organization that helps underprivileged kids that don't have much to do after school and they've received a whole bunch of attention by the way I'll link them below if you want to make a donation or just go say hi unbelievable organization but that was my holiday video thank you for just the overwhelming support especially thank you from the girls and boys merch this merch my current merch store you know I have three items for sale this is an experiment this is something I wanted to see if there was interest in I wanted to see if I liked the process and the short answer to all that is this is awesome and I want to be more than just t-shirts and sweatshirts I want to figure out how to like how to have like a place where I can sell all the crap that I'm interested in that maybe you're interested in a place where I can work with like nonprofits to raise all the money and do fundraisers that I like to do a place that's like I don't like a big fat commerce site or online commerce place where I can do more than just sell t-shirts and sweatshirts maybe I've been spending too much time my friend Peter McKinnon but in 2018 not to make much more of an effort to make the process of creating a bigger part of mine of my video narrative it's something I talked a lot about like in 2000 season one of the bloggers I talked a lot about the gear I use and how I got the shots that I got I've gotten away from that I only get back to that just as a quick nod to that you'll notice that this video and the videos that I'll be posting in the near future anyways are not 4k I've gone back to 1080 instead I'm trying to focus on a sharper focus and a shallower depth of field I want to make these videos a little bit more cinematic in order to do that I'm letting go of the higher resolution and I'm embracing sort of better dynamic range in better color science and and the kinds of aesthetic values that I prioritize during the first season of my vlog and that brings up one of the bigger questions that I asked myself especially looking to the future and that is what is this channel you know a year ago at this time I just stopped vlogging CNN just bought my company I had no idea what 2017 might bring in 2017 for me was a bit of a scramble like I I wasn't sure where this channel fit in I started vlogging again but that didn't feel rights that I just went to uploading with some consistency but then I would sit it was a mess and when I looked at 2018 I don't specifically know what I want to do but I do know that regular uploads and having a very specific sort of narrative agenda behind this channel is going to be a priority of mine I just think for my own well-being like when I told myself the first season of the vlog was gonna post a video every single day no matter what that was such like good guidance for me it was very helpful for me creatively and I want to kind of give myself a mission like that for 2018 with this YouTube channel this closet the podcast we're doing it a hundred percent guaranteed positively fully committed we're doing the podcast we just want to rush into it we're gonna do it in 2018 in January a few weeks from now but we needed to take this time to figure out how to do it best practices do we get a studio to be knocking the studio sound quality distribution methods all those things we're figuring out right now but we're doing it the immediate future so like I said I was on that romantic vacation for the last week no vlogging for that no making videos for that I leave in two more days for another trip this is a family trip we're going to see Candace's family it's like a big thing I'll be gone for another like 8 or 10 days or something I want to try and not make videos while I'm there as well I find taking these big breaks lets my brain clear up and it lets me enjoy my time with my family but that doesn't mean I'm not going to upload have a couple of videos that I shot they've just been sitting on my hard drive from like the weeks passed I want to share those videos and then I have one like ace in the hole this video that I was working on like months and months and months ago when I finished sounds like it's not good enough and then we revisited it I'm gonna release release that in the next couple of days and that's a video I'm really excited about that video is gonna be my new channel trailer okay thank you - PO - zoo for sending me these awesome Star Wars shoes check out my Teddy fresh hat gah do you know this stuff is so good alright and my last thing on my list of things to update you with this is something I'm very excited about something I've been looking forward to sharing with you [Music] remember juice press the juice place I still come to in like every single episode my buddy owns this place check this out how's the hot sauce selling good where is it I've got my own juice press hot sauce have you tried it what do you think CII I want to figure out how to sell these in the merge store but for now it's just kind of like a fun thing that I'm doing with the with the owner of juice press which is like a local New York City G shop Marcus is my homie I'd do anything to support this place but come on dip it put my face on a hot sauce bottle also I was paid for this in juice all right it's not exciting update number 10 until I figure out how to put these on my merch site just simply come to downtown Manhattan and come come to this juice press and buy yourself a bottle of uh KC hot sauce how much is the KC hot sauce top $5 all right so dust consists thus concludes my exactly ten part update video and here's the future [Music]", "label": "#"}, {"data": "[Music] yesterday what should have forgot to finish my I didn't upload yesterday he on Saturday on Saturday I dropped the family off at the airport i socio with them but we decided last minute that me spending five days of the in-laws would probably be a terrible idea not a big fan of using your blinker are you Candace there they go goodbye family goodbye drop the family off at the airport and then yesterday Sunday I had this big idea to shoot this amazing episode that started with me going on a significant run it's Sunday Candace and the baby are out of town but go ahead and take advantage of this free time by going for a very serious run right now I got a little carried away with the run all right all right that's one one miles too much thank four mile five mile sit [Music] that's seven miles I mean it was like the first real warm spring summery day of the year I just I just kept running that's eight nine ten eleven mild kind like you twelve months all right mile fourteen then to these guys and this guy all right I need like forest coughs level kept running fifteen fifty miles seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty all right I'm going to call it there that was uh eating 21 miles great Sunday run see in that that's where things kind of fell apart that is 21 miles an easy 816 days I got back from the run and that's when I was like going to shoot an episode and do everything else get my day started but I took one of those showers you just got to stand there and fall asleep standing up and then I thought why not just lie down for a second I haven't slept more than four hours unless we pass out still light out passed out and I just slept yeah so like six in this morning that's why that's why I miss an episode yesterday nah cuz I was taking time off with the family like I said but because I went for an irresponsibly long run and then passed out and then slept like 14 hours like a hibernating grizzly bear and then Here I am now it's Monday alright well and I want to see that I want to see that hat yes look at this this up you think this is a little bit he's busy he think he's aware every day the bum and I didn't contribute like this you know like yeah oh you look like a ball did you see Marlon thanks a lot nice hat Marlatt like that maybe it's one getting old you know people in the comments keep reminding about how old I am here's the thing about old when people make fun of you and they tell you that you're you're stupid you cannot anonymous smart and then when people like call you ugly things like not on my mom says I'm super handsome but when people tell you your old old is objective old is a number that you cannot hide from I am old I'm 36 yet I guess that means that after a solid Sunday afternoon run that I just can't get out there and make a vlog because I have to sleep for 14 hours all right that's it now it's time to leave I now have a clue 30 to 35 minute cab ride to the airport I'll play up a half an hour of downtime there then then like a three and a half hours that's what the rest of my afternoon look like a lot of a ride to LaGuardia do you think sir 30 minutes 30 minutes come off the gas about 35 minutes you think we can make it without stopping for gas I got 14 miles left that's personal that's person I'm going right out [Music] goodbye New York City you will be min how's the gas situation looking good looking good looking good the carcass all right thank you and I am back at the airport thank you for starting gasps slate board then 45 have a little snack lounge food wasn't bad it wasn't great but it wasn't that [Music] [Music] interesting situation here something sure you saw it in the news but yesterday there was this video of a guy being ejected off the United flight four they overbooked the flight they didn't have a sefer and asked them to leave he refused they dragged him off the plane whatever anything like that happens I always actually thought what would I do in that situation especially today when I'm actually flying on a United play wish me luck I don't know what to say this guy he's awesome little that's what you want to say the vlog he's awesome listen to you so far so good I think we're going to make it to CSUN okay this is a quick like 36-hour trip Owen and Francine and Candice they're already there for

so please remain seated while your people okay thank you bye-bye you don't have to say the flight attendants and the staff on that flight were just lovely but I read about 20 different accounts of

take care [Music] we're tasting yes me please accent let it be bring the camera in there I'll see you tomorrow [Music]", "label": "G"}, {"data": "[Music] 23 like 102 105 degrees in the city and for so many so heat advisories in effect for the city in Westchester the song taught in the city by Billy Idol was written when he lived in a one-bedroom studio there was like a hundred degrees out in that air-conditioned mat that was his inspiration for that song great song [Applause] don't be afraid it's not like you're in Arizona or someone like that it's not crazy hot but look 93 that's pretty hot for New York City ah something I really like to do here on YouTube is find smaller or newer or less well-known youtubers and then share those youtubers that I really like with you my audience I like to do that because it kind of gives them a little bit more exposure and I like to think that if you watch this channel that you're also interested in what I'm interested in any event I have a youtuber that's coming by right now that I'm very excited for you to meet but first [Music] she's here hello wait wait am i looking yes it right now right there there God okay got it this is Molly Molly G youtuber we met at VidCon yes okay and this is how it went I walk into some lounge or something like that they're all over Pacifica I heard somebody whisper I think that's Casey nice dad and I think I like tiny hear that a lot so I didn't think much of it I turned around and went to see you said that so I could say hi and then I saw this rule right here say well is it him or is it not him and whoever you see news like I can't tell him you like well I can't tell I'm blind I can't see him is it Casey or not that time at Molly and that's how I found out that you can't see yes so how is someone both blind and a youtuber Molly well there was a bit more that went into the decision to make youtube videos and maybe for most people because obviously like I can't set up my camera on my lighting I can't make sure I'm in focus I can't edit my videos and so there was there was more that had to go into figuring all that out and my mom comes down and she films with me so she'll make sure I'm in focus she takes the thumbnail so in short I always have a mom that you trust to tell you you look good on camera I would say I'm like Cinderella I have my own talking mirror everywhere I go and mine ears name is mom have you always been blind I've always been visually impaired I haven't always been blind until I was 14 and in grade 8 the disease was kind of triggered and I lost pretty much the majority of my vision to what I have now what can you see now like what do you see now like there's a bright light there's bright light and then there's me and there's I can't like what what do you see so I see the world in light and shadow I can see light so I can see that there's a big square of light and like I can see that there's a little bulb above us and that there's different light and that there's strips of lighting on the ceiling I have is like globe light pane over there but I can't see or no depth perception rather so I don't know if that light is in touching distance or if it's far away can you see me at all see when you like look towards the light and stop I can see that there's their shining on your glasses so if I sit right there I can see that your glasses all right they're two little spots that's all I see so then everything around those two little spots reflecting off your glasses is totally black so you don't know what I look like not at all before you lost your vision did you ever see a movie with Brad Pitt in it what got you to a place of wanting to share so much of who you are in your life to the world Florine been a big problem it was a big part of my life when I lost my vision I also lost all of my friends and and so I could take this negative thing that happened to me and make it something positive for other people we're going to go outside now and Molly's unit share with me what it's like to be visually impaired right mm-hmm I'm going to borrow your scarf okay buddy hey buddy thank you [Music] all right blindfold on ready to go okay so you just have to trust that I can't see it is this recording Zach yeah give address that I can't do this so a lot of people when they like want to help a blind person might try to grab our hand or push us or grab our shoulders not the right thing to do probably over offer the elbow so you're going to grab my right elbow cuz gallop is trained to always be on my left so the boom I'm going to come over in front of you so I sit on your lap right okay yeah well just know how many like axes and things are hanging in this studio I've never been so scared in my own office before okay yes on the button every is on the left 500 I'm out I think a fire thing we won't we don't want there that I have done do your Braille on the button we're working on this new stressing you guys write down and not just their family they're Israel right no this is interesting for both of us see I are seeing different accessibility as I said we're going about yeah I do too I think we're gonna have a long elevator ride oh I gotta be this is the first floor second floor second could you push the button for the first floor please gasps softly okay we have successfully made it to the front door Oh however there is no oh god no let's go left affiliate coffee okay ah we're going to hit the streets soon across the street and at the end of the next block is a coffee shop on the left and what do you do what do we do so hopefully walk by how do you know when they're coming to have well yes Alyssa that sounded like traffic was going south it not endow the booth but now flick traffic has always been going up okay let's just risk it I might kill you today but I appreciate that you're taking this breast with me how do we know we're up the curb Galvez off where the curb police also stares verbs like nothing to find the door so when I get to the corner then I'll ask him to find the door yes do you smell like everything see you learn like he looks like old eerie music from that store into the south so it's positive oh I'm talking out goes okay you so much yes how do you know whether it's your turn order is it my turn order yes that's how I know so how do you notice someone's dropping you often we go really but how do I touch their country you have to ask them to help you you know how do you know like what sugar to put into your coffee I asked okay so I'm going to take off my blindfold Wow that was an absolutely like jarring experience for me it was really like everything I knew about life here hearing it in a different once we recessed did you're experiencing it with your ears with your nose with your hands like I always say my hands are my eyes because I'm always a touching thing my more than that like you know you know in a weird way and I said it very gently it was much scarier the phrase I didn't touch somebody but I was afraid that she was unitard me too much my coffee they never would hear resident and gentleman from their perfect unfree ruining it by car as a pre we're going to offend the people around us how the princess doesn't even get the right coffee like I think how you think you know what this is I always helpful for you I just bring you into this experience and you've never done it before of course it's going to feel really scary and it's probably going to feel overwhelming and it's probably going to feel like you can't do it but the reality is this is lying on this is my everyday and for people who are in wheelchairs for people who are blind for people who are deaf or missing a limb this is our normal you know I've been blind for nine years I don't know life's excitement so for me asking for people to help me all the time or for me listening to the traffic surges or for me listening and smelling different places know where I am is north and so to me it's not difficult and it's not scary and it's not jarring it's not and it's just like I wake up I do my makeup I make my breakfast I see your overcoat I do my own makeup yep she's my own outfit you know I do I just live like Molly before you go I made a present for you what okay it's here oh my goodness story of my own Casey sunglasses yes I made you a custom pair of my sunglass the other look on you then look right on you look at this I even engraved your name on the side oh there's a note on that side and then what is it say thanks what about them we'll figure let's see how we both slept with her they look good on you they fit you very well well I thank you for coming by thank you for you for the lighting we come by vision in terror we say blank why thank you black-and-white on

cinematography is such a key part of well [Music] we're here I'm here dan and I are here in Dublin because I'm because I'm attending the Dublin tech summit which is this afternoon but why I'm only here for like a day and while I was in Montreal for like two hours and and Chicago for like three hours tomorrow we'll be in Belgium for half a day I used to always accept the invitation accept the opportunity to go to these awesome events so it was a great way to see the world and go to these events but like in the last year between family and work and everything else it makes it hard to like use this as an excuse to spend a week in Ireland or use it as an excuse to spend a few days in Montreal or Chicago so it's just these like quick turns I definitely miss taking time to like embrace these new cities but in the same respect you know priorities shift and now my priority is being home Casey did bad idea bad idea working on this Daily Show for the last 15 days I've come up with a rhyme to help me understand how to achieve on how to achieve what we set out for every day so if if the story b-roll and pretty images take a backseat b-roll and pretty in be role and pretty images

"label": "G"}, {"data": "okay I think I got it it's taken me like 25 minutes to figure out that effect in fact I've had a Pete Evan Lestat we've all been trying to figure that ox it's like this mean that I saw on Twitter God look how good hers is ready it's funny every single time differences that's real do you think that's real magic do you think that mine is as funny of that no you can be honest look good no comment the whole scene is okay welcome to 360 [Music] okay so I don't know if you know Evans channel or not you should if you don't I'll link it below but great very smart channel and we were just having a conversation about editing like editing videos with y'all what the hell are we saying just how editing is really yeah we were talking about outsourcing like I had my managers are constantly asking me to outsource parts of my show so that I can free up time to be more productive with other things and I just can't possibly see how that would work and I've tried like people always say when I bitch about how busy I am everyone's always like get an editor yeah get an editor I tried or people are like cool that Dan edits to your videos Dan that's what I thought I thought he edited a incredibly talented but he doesn't come anywhere near these edits sometimes he color corrects me doesn't do the edits and of the 800 videos I have in my channel I've yet to find somebody who can edit my voice yeah literally the milliseconds between two lines in a voiceover I am spending probably 15 minutes moving that audio file like zooming in all the way and moving it just a tiny little bit playing it over and saying is that pause enough to get to jump it into the next thing is the momentum the right way like I can't imagine anyone anyone because that's your brain yeah it's very frustrating when you see comments and notes where people are so dismissive of editing as if it's like putting gasoline in your car like it's an objective process or a mechanical process the art is in the Edit and the fun is in the Edit - I don't agree with that well I mean I know like I enter like a flow State in editing it's when you finish the Edit there's nothing more satisfying yeah and there's nothing more disturbing than realizing you haven't eaten for 13 hours okay Evan in Casey discuss editing [Music] hello and welcome to tech review Tuesday tech review Tuesday were and I review a piece of technology that I'm interested in or curious about and share my findings with you on this week's episode I'm going to be reviewing the new DJI Ronin s video stabilizer but before I do that I wanted to share with you some technology that I think is really really cool I'm not going to review I just want to just want to show you this this is made by a small company out of Detroit called shinola and what's cool about this company shinola the company was started when all of the auto workers in Detroit were losing their jobs and this company was started to put all those like skilled workers to work making other things in addition to making watches and handbags and all that stuff they made they did a super super limited edition run they made 500 of these things this is a proper turntable like a record player shinola as we were sort of building out what the audio system should be down at 368 I was like I was like let's use this handmade american-made Detroit made and turntable I don't know record players but this is just the bit that sits on it this probably weighs like 20 pounds this is like a piece of jewelry Wow [Music] [Laughter] [Music] now I'm no audiophile I'm not like one of those music guys but the audio difference from like something like this like an actual record with high quality speakers versus like I usually do like ear pods and Spotify myself the sound quality is unbelievably different okay so now for the tech review part of tech review Tuesday this is the Ronin s the roving 2's is a a gimbal for SLR cameras made by DJI the same company that makes all the drones that I and everybody else the world uses designed is the all-in-one workhorse for almost any type of filmic Ronin s is packed with incredible features that offer the ultimate flexibility for single or multiple operators on any set [Music] a 3-axis gimbal is basically a mechanism to make sure a camera stays steady as it's recording as it's moving this is a three axis gimbal by GoPro and see in theory anyways no matter how much I move this handle the camera stays in sort of the same position this right here this is a gimbal on the bottom of a drone same idea you put the camera here no matter how you move your hand it stays in one position what was typically used for stabilizers for bigger cameras or something like this this is a really fantastic device made by movi you put the you put a camera down here and then no matter how you move this thing it stays stable amazing device this is how I shot the snowboarding in New York City movie and the Aladdin video was with this bad boy but it's a little bit big a little unruly you have to actually have a stand just to put the thing down from where I gathered the Ronin s is kind of the answer to all of that it's a small handheld stabilizer that does what the big one that does what the big one does but is the size of one of the smaller more miniaturized gimbals it totally Crittenden let's do this so was lovin right so this thing does a lot more features than what we're playing with it for today there's an app that works with it that you can program you to really complicated time lapse features the Ronin s app complements the gimbal giving filmmakers even greater control over their creativity wherever your passion takes you I've only used it for about fifteen minutes it feels super simple how's your arm I mean it's heavy it is heavy it takes one hand you can definitely operate it with one hand there is something I liked about it which is the you can have a microphone on this like I do here and still have it work on the gimbal and still be as stable as can be which is pretty amazing oh the selfie mode is really good too like your gorilla pod I mean you have a really good grip on it so you have stable shots but all you have to do is hold that thing you'll get really stable yeah if you're like a sociopath when it comes to making vlogs you could shoot this all of your vlogs on something like this like look this is me using this as if it's a selfie stick slip on you have to have strong forearms this thing about double the weight doubles the weight of the camera but it is amazing that this replaces such a gigantic piece of hardware alright so we do some shots through the trees now yeah let's some cinema [Music] oh okay that concludes the first look of the Ronin s3 accent three axis stabilizer huge fat thumbs up take it for what it's worth though because we've only had three hours with this issue just starting to play with it so far very impressed I do want to flag that I I have a plan to shoot an entire episode of three six eight using just this gimbal to give it right to give like a really comprehensive review of all the details and all the features that this thing does that'll come soon for now though good work DJI and would you look at this look at this beauty right now [Music] [Music] you [Music]", "label": "G"}, {"data": "[Music] [Music] [Music] imagine if you will a reality in which a population was so mediocre they produced more bad films than good ones a reality too ghastly to imagine well open your eyes because there in that world that world is the real

gone all right thank God it's just a crowd this Halloween we're gonna do something real scary we're gonna watch howling - your sister is a werewolf whatever you go to Kubrick's normal this film is also known by its original name howling - sturby werewolf bitch which if I'm being honest it's got a pretty good ring to it I don't know why they changed that this film almost as if divinely appeared on our planet in the year 1985 starring legendary actor Christopher Lee may he rest in peace it was poised for worldwide success in acclaim or was it while Lee was portrayed in a number of memorable roles such as Saruman the white and the rhymes with poopoo count dooku from the worst star wars movie there were also some roles he may have preferred States Six Feet Under sealed away deep in a mausoleum to be forgotten by man and lost to time but alas we have the Internet and well they they pretty much got everything on there so it's pretty hard to hide stuff I'm warning you wear a helmet this one's gonna be rough the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with blood hey there mr. Lee can I call you Chris did you even know you're being filmed here is that have I got you to be in this movie they just didn't tell you as a movie and she held full mr.ali look out there's a skeleton behind you and there it is howling to your sister's a werewolf I'm feeling I'm gonna be maybe howling a few minutes over here the film starts off at the funeral of a woman who was recently killed the guy at the altar goes on about how everything sucks for a few minutes really getting everyone into the spirit of things the death of anyone is a sad occasion even Hitler nothing we can say or do can bring Karen back shortly thereafter the director points the camera and microphone in the wrong direction as Christopher Lee and another man whispered to each other about dead sisters in the distance what honey I didn't catch that oh just get the hell out of here so Christopher Lee's character named Stefan is a paranormal investigator who tells the brother of the woman who died that he needs to give him a call at his earliest convenience Stefan Kraus co-investigator meanwhile Stefan's the talk of the town as a town's fault can't help but become horny and bother at the mere sight of him Stefan let's go yeah that's normal mr. Krakow how do you know my name I've seen you on television what do you know about the death of Karen white I know that she is a werewolf oh okay in that case you think you could elaborate mr. cross go yeah never mind no need to explain further got you she's a werewolf Scott it's all good Jenny what do you say you said your sister is a werewolf ah bullshit the howling - is filmed in front of a live studio audience really that's it bullshit no no further comment wait what where are we now what a jump cut that was look Maddy you've gotta be kidding me Chrissy boy over here still got in his old age I got I gotta get I gotta give props where it's due so then all of a sudden focus switches to some characters that sound like a couple of Australians that got concussions say that better myself gonna say that better myself after this exchange the local thuggery right off into an apocalyptic wasteland and out to a warehouse to get jiggy with it but little do they know in reality she's having a really bad cramp in her leg so you wanna play huh we like to play too don't we yeah Wow looks like he doesn't even have the correct amount of brain cells to process the pain in time [Music] yeah that actually just heard for fucking real I forgot whatever joke it is I had planned for that let's move on everyone you made deacon man and he gets real nasty when he's mad this can't be real right this movie is not a comedy and yet the timing is impeccable the great John Candy would have been in awe if he could see this today I know you're there my little beauty and I've got something for ya oh yeah that's threatening alright come on weird nothing strange going on just wanna party so of course this woman was actually a werewolf and she was luring these people to her lair to get eaten [Applause] [Music] bakit wherever the fuck they are the two people from the funeral earlier decided to go to Stefan's house and hear him out after all meanwhile in this scene a sexual predator watches exposition from a distance there are a couple of things I know about you sister oh yeah tell me more backstory maybe this isn't even good exposition I can't Jack my big old dick after this Wow dude why are you bringing this from a zero to a ten put that thing away then when the Bombers start knocking off the chickens we start knocking off the bombs so they meet with Stefan and his mansion full of weird shit these are done I trust you'd like to see my robust collection of deformed bonobo heads we don't have very much time so I will get to the point immediately this type of bullet killed your sister impossible how could a simple bullet kill a perfectly healthy woman notice anything about them they're silver you know what that means this silver this type of bone against white means your sister is a werewolf Oh God does it though for sure you sure about that it means that your sister was working on a story about one such group you telling me my sister arranged her own murder yes okay this is a videotape of Karen White's last news broadcast oh god that's no that's the wrong thing heavens meet mr. Cotto this is the right one the tape that Stefan shows them depicts this man's sister being murdered live on broadcast as she turns into a werewolf [Applause] [Music] it's fake that's not my sister Ben I recognize those people proof Stephan also explains that the werewolves have a leader named Sterba and that it is his mission in life to destroy her once and for all Stella must be destroyed and I won't do it I think at this point Chris really just kind of starts to improv as lines or at least you know realize the magnitude of his regret on screen either way is beautiful evolution is reversed how can you listen to this ball I resent such words take those bullets and God be with you thank you right do you think Stefan is going on their cemetery tonight to set traps by the way how much that glue from earlier where I squirted in my nose you think got in my brain forgot about the state we got about what now drive a stake through werewolves right wait drive a stake through a werewolves heart unless we're talking about filet mignon I think you might be mixing up vampires and werewolves son of a bitch was talking about my sister no stickiness taking my dead sister yeah I mean I gotta give it to you this is pretty weird not really a normal thing to go around be doing I'm gonna kill the son of a bitch last bit maybe it's best before so been storms off determined to kill Stefan before he can desecrate his sister and Christopher Lee stands on a freeway overpass in Los Angeles for some fucking reason you sure this is the way to the crypt yeah oh yeah that's the way to decrypt all right nothing I stalking your sisters dead body with the conclusion of this event and in Jenny now see that the tail of the werewolves is all true so they shoot bullets at a nearby janitor with facial deformities for fun poor guy I mean he wasn't a werewolf he just bored the big old cleft face after feeling bad for the wretched soul they kindly drape him in a net for warmth and force him to reveal the location of Sterba Queen of the werewolves before kindly stabbing him in the heart with the blade again for warmth guy was cold come on what are you gonna do leave him there I don't know I was thinking of hitting up the nightclub again I want to make sure that what happened to my sister never happens anybody else again when do we leave where do we have to go to find sturby of course Belle skeleton I should have known that through the dog country you don't mean South Jersey Transylvania Transylvania what okay once again the vampire one not the werewolf one okay just pointing it out so yes off they go to Transylvania to fight the werewolves boy it hurts I have to wonder if these weird Dracula references have something to do with the fact that Christopher Lee used to play Dracula back in the 50s I bet they were very proud they snuck this in just got it right past the masses and then they have a ceremony for Grandma I am granny save some of that ecto cooler for the rest of us we're running out again and you ghostbusters well we didn't do that well oh damn Nana you're looking much younger what kind of juice cleanse was that again [Music] this woman was hit by a car we must get her to a doctor quickly you good with that take you don't want to you don't want to maybe try that line read one more time maybe was this even planned is this just some shit they filmed on the side of the road in Eastern Europe that's not an actor is it this really happened that's just an old lady who really got hit by a car she's gonna die isn't she she's trying to say hello okay you're just gonna go you're all done here it's gonna walk away ladies still down still got one down over here oh god that's not Madison where the hell everybody go yeah yeah I'm not really sure I'm following you on this one and after you stabbed that lady who got hit by the car in the heart I'm thinking maybe you don't have the best judgment Stefan please Stefan where you going why are you leaving it's a farm where you going come back here come on over here I'm going to the village I will see you there later shortly after going to a local poon house to get my tank licked so now we arrive at the next setting of the film what is supposedly a small Eastern European town in Transylvania lovely room for the lady in gentleman room six six six this hotel doesn't look like it has six floors thereafter Jenni brings out some vampire garlic to piss me off even further and she won't stop talking like a baby seriously everyone in this movie talks like an actual baby asking where their mom is where's Stefan I don't know what the hell we're doing here I think the director felt similarly fucking Christ that escalated fast Oh God please stop oh just make it stop what is this Godfather 3 you tried to dethrone the king and queen of the awkward makeout scene Oh No is that a midget beckoning well you know shits about to go down if a midget beckons these men have sworn to fight still a Silla must his humble brother daughter his wife and Jesus last year he was crucified by werewolves the time being I just want you to behave as ordinary tourists how do we keep in touch with each other Constantine and Lucca or set up a puppet boozing square and you could communicate with me through them all through Father Florida instead of like all that dough could just call your cell phone so that night Jenny decides to take a bath and unwind from all this chaos Oh No a creeping dolly shot that can only mean one thing oh my god it's a werewolf or a loli then this comes back my god it's just not right how do you think they felt on set huh look at this guy look at him you think he was really into that secretly pretending he wasn't he looks pretty into that condom keep an eye on Jenna at this point in the film things are just getting more and more 80s as time goes on I'm in fact not entirely sure they didn't just accidentally slip in some b-roll from a Madonna concert [Music] after Jenny is captured against her own will and Ben descends on stir bus castle things begin to escalate gradually with an email is Sabbath what do you want to do about sentry a penis knife why didn't I think of that [Music] [Applause] I know that's right that one I can't can't get can't get as much behind that one what in the goddamn hell is happening in this stupid movie lord then now Stephane is like following a weird little girl down an alleyway because she has some locket yeah that's probably the best course of action like there's no one figured out that this set of circumstances usually leads to a murder still gonna follow her down the alley little laughing girl alright let's do it just two last question I have been Gandalf thank you for your that's all I needed you all right no no actually I don't think I'm ever gonna unsee that we must leave for the castle tonight these are our weapons the consecrated oil wax from the sacred candles a dagger forged from titanium and a chalice which held the sacred blood of Christ oh you got that and this is just a fucking gun I'll take that yeah that's probably the best choice also can we talk about how just you know nobody bothered to ask how he got the Holy Grail he just got that just has that also that means Jesus has proved real we're just gonna whiz on by this [Music] so as we reach the climax Stephane finally confronts turbo demons and powers of adversity bound and held subject to his will we meet again all of us [Music] in the name of God day I don't know what the use of showing that guy's face was dog cake now with dragons coming out of it yeah hopefully the Christmas episode isn't this weird so the curse is reversed Sterba is killed and Ben and Jenny get out unscathed to live happily ever after or do they Jenny for the last time I told you this is Halloween they dress up it's just a thing you know what forget it you're a sweet kid just don't worry about it your neighbors on your trial just knocked on our door coming a little later I hope so hey I think compared to that I would have preferred my neighbor was a werewolf oh by the way the sister is still trapped in the crypt screaming screaming forever is a werewolf because no one laid her to rest just thought I'd point that out okay now here's the credits sequence and I don't know if I can accurately impart how ridiculous this is so over the credits they use the song from the beginning and I've not edited this at all this is how it is to the beat of the music they loop this woman Sybil Danning ripping her shirt off in the scene from earlier 17 times to the beat of the music hallelujah there is a God after all [Applause] what can you really say huh sometimes you just want to share your art with the world just want to share some

sit in the lounge for three and a half hours my favorite city in the whole world Amsterdam is right there I'm going to try to go to the city get back to the airport and make my flight in three hours just terrible idea [Music] okay I'm ahead of schedule right now here's the rundown my flight is at 10:00 a.m. out of this very airport it's currently 6:40 a.m. the flight boards at 9:30 - so I'm going to go ahead and put a countdown timer it on the clock - keeps constantly in check with how much more time I visit the beautiful city of Amsterdam I'm almost out of the airport [Music] eliza ticket to

the world Amsterdam our first stop and only stop will be the bridge that I proposed to Candace on [Music] there it is that's our bridge that's the bridge that's right proposed ended so I made I made a movie about this set if you haven't seen you to check it out it's one of the movies that like I'm most proud of it took me a whole summer to make the movie but the apex of the movie was me proposing to Candace right on this bridge she and I had come to Amsterdam when we first met like years and years and years earlier it was an amazing time so that year I remember at Euro 2012 or something I got her tickets to Amsterdam for Valentine's Day like that was the idea we're coming here for Valentine's Day and we got here I was so nervous I wasn't nervous that she was gonna say no I was nervous that she was gonna find out we got here and I know it's this bridge because we checked into that hotel right over there now hotel she was like what do you want to do it I was if it's just go for a walk we walked on this bridge I'm being kind of a minister like people around so I don't like wait for the people disappear and then yeah then I just popped the question I remember she didn't say yes right away that can it's what the fuck but she told me later that she just was like so overwhelmed that she didn't know what to do alright that's my whole Amsterdam proposal story it's now 7:30 to it I feel like nothing's open I know what else to do but I'll keep skateboarding around [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so I had a very bad people fall I was getting to the train station and my skateboard wheel fell into where the tram like the streetcar tracks are and the skateboard just stopped cold and I went full weight forward but like I see no 25 pound backpack was my laptop in any problem and my camera in my hand and I I broke this camera that's why I'm recording this on my phone but I fell on my hands in a really bad way and when looked out at my pinky this is an accurate depiction of what my hand looked like that was my pinky literally been half like that like you see in those viral YouTube video for vibration finger in time that's what it look like like my immediate instinct rush get nice in here is hospital but then I like took a deep breath and I grabbed onto in my hand I just like snapped it like snap into place with force and it kind of went back together and it's pretty swollen right now but it works and it's not like it was so I definitely did some damage but I forced it back into place and although while to the doctor when I get to Finland I don't think it's going to kill me in the next couple of hours it was scary [Music] - tikal - and - a clown able to monitor snowfall in culture that is how you take advantage of a three-hour layover I was way better than sitting in the lounge eating tiny fish on now I'm gonna get some ice and I'm gonna get some work done and can't wait to get the Finland [Music]", "label": "G"}, {"data": "success on YouTube still means a life of poverty I'm reading to you from from Bloomberg this is the lead of the article this is the first sentence in the article do your children dream of YouTube stardom do them a favor crush that ambition now this is an article it's actually not a bad article in Cristo Coll Walker I don't actually mean it's about new research out of Germany build as among the first to review the chances of making it in the new Hollywood ie making it on YouTube it presents all kinds of objective data like 96.5% of all of those trying to become youtubers won't make enough money off of advertising to crack the US poverty line most of the story is about objective data that quantifies just how challenging it is to succeed on this platform this whole article starts from the premise that the only reason why you'd want to be on YouTube the only reason why you want to be a youtuber is because of the financial upside and I think that's absolutely ridiculous I think to make a statement like that let alone write an article like this with that being your foundation is insulting to this entire platform I'm not naive to the fact that a lot of people see YouTube as a cash register I also know that there are a lot of creators I think the majority of the creators that I've come in contact with who are first motivated by their own desire to make things in and to share their own ideas and I do I think it is that fact that motivates a lot of new creators to come to this platform and people who otherwise wouldn't be filmmakers or content creators or video or TV people they're encouraged by what they see here on YouTube to create they're not just motivated by by a check which is what this article kind of insinuates that's my beef with the article I will link this article below there's a lot of interesting stuff in there I really recommend you check it out please do not send the author of this article any negativity I disagree with his premise but I do appreciate the article well I got you here while I'm doing a little talking ahead video I thought I would address the new the new YouTube Partner and monetization thing where you have to have a thousand subscribers or four thousand hours of watch time in the past year to monetize your channel I've seen especially since the Robert Kinsel interviews so many people have approached me about what are my thoughts on this that follows socialblade on Twitter and they've just been tearing YouTube to pieces about this ready this says today's the day YouTube is as we tweet removing everyone from networks and removing monetization options if you fall below the 1000 subs and $4,000 of watch time in the past 365 days if you survive today congratulations hashtag YouTube Partner culling ouch first of all I hate I hate what this says to small creators I hate this idea that it says to you if you have a small channel a tiny channel that your content doesn't have value and while it sucks and it may be challenging for you it doesn't mean your work isn't of value and I know and I like to think that YouTube knows that the next big generation of creators in this platform are people who right now have less than a thousand subs that's where it starts anything that you really want life is always really hard to get and and YouTube is no different so the hurdles a little bit higher now but the opportunity is still there and I end this by by bringing up my friend Peter McKinnon Peter's a huge youtuber now he has a million seven subscribers his contents fantastic Peter's channels like 13 or 14 months old a year ago I didn't know him a year ago he had a little over a year ago he had zero subscribers he earned zero Adsense he had zero brand deals he had no channel at all but he started it he brought something new to the channel he worked really hard he did some interesting things to bring press and attention to what he was doing on the platform and now he is by all definitions a successful youtuber so yes it's harder and it's only gonna get harder the opportunity is still there it's definitely harder to succeed on YouTube today than it was yesterday it was harder yesterday than it was 12 days ago or nine days ago before they started this new policy but it's easier today than it will be tomorrow and it's definitely easier today in 2018 then it will be next year in 2019 and so on and so on and so on so if you're a dream let me rewrite this article for it for this guy if your children dream of YouTube stardom do them a favor support that ambition now if your dream is to be a youtuber do it do not let this discourage you charge ahead because the world of creativity needs you all do not there is no try", "label": "G"}, {"data": "I think my parents are ready today I mean they should be ready today thank you very much see when I dropped the pants off Eric told me that today would be the day that the repairs are done that can pick them up so I'm just waiting to hear from him but I'm pretty sure today's the day that the pants are ready this term this term called planned obsolescence and in the most simple terms what that means is when something that's designed or actually built to replace like something that is designed to be replaced for example when cars first came out way back in the day these things were bomb-proof they could be fixed they could be repaired they lasted forever then when everybody who kind of wanted a car had a car if the car industry needed to create a reason people to buy new cars so they started designing them differently and promote artificial reasons for people to replace what they already have planned obsolescence now we live in a disposable culture where everything you buy is meant to be used up and then thrown away and then bought again that's not always a bad thing for example it makes things less expensive cars now they're all made out of plastic and they're not meant to last 3040 years but they're safer they're cheaper they're lighter they're easier to produce that's it I'm not a plan of disposability I like to fix things I like to build things part of the reason why boosted board so much my biggest beef with the boosted board is how damn expensive ridiculously astronomically expensive these electric skateboards are when I give Sanjay the CEO for our expensive these things are his response is always the same these things are designed and built to be repaired and fixed and a lot of the cost of those repairs are built into the cost of the skateboards and I will say I've had to send mine back a bunch of time they're all like modular part engine can be replayed all can be replayed wheels come off that can be replace the fantastic battery can be replaced everything on this is built to be replaced and fixed this is not a disposable object so I like it this studio is a testament to my love or affinity for repairing instead of replacing or building instead of buying like this is this plumbing pipe implied with all healthy other wood screws as a little tool area just so I can build out and fix and repair this studio space by myself instead of throwing away crappy furniture and replacing it with equally crappy furniture I like to make things I like to fix things so why the diatribe about planned obsolescence okay my what's up my favorite pair of jeans from my favorite jeans store completely fell apart on me so I just beat the SH out of them and I sent them back and he fix them and not only doctor like fixing his products as part of his business and I love that did the CMS does Araki ones' teen shop I'm doing a whole like thing about planned obsolescence and why I like to fix things instead of replace things so my question for you is why do you bought why do you fix teens instead of just encouraging people to buy new ones we do both you got to be booked but when you fall in love with your jeans or your favorite your favorite thing in life and they tell story all your jeans tell a great story you don't wanna give up so quick so we fix who these those are God used to work here you know these is just an art piece now that's an option to display Wow all right where my pants at all holes are Pat how did you across filming cities are my favorite pant these are my favorite pants they completely sort of disintegrated budgets beat on them so much when layoffs which were here to experience aw but this is not like a paid advertisement or anything Eric's just an old friend and I'm just a dissipating the whole operation okay I forgot that part of the story the reason why we initially met I made a video about this but I was hit on my motorcycle the ambulance cut the pants off of me I sent him to shredded up pants it was sent me a new pair that's how friendships are born so we saw that I was like you in 2007 the book amazing all right you not a paid advertisement just a friend but if you find yourself in New York City's SoHo come visit gene shop

done like what I wanted to move to New York City and my dad was like you can't you know I mean or when I first said I wanted to make movies it was you can't you didn't go to film school I want to have a TV show you can't Casey you're not pretty enough and egotism for going about it characterize what this new generation of content creators and filmmaker what we all do on YouTube everywhere else we do what we can't you can't be an action movie still naked so I see JT parkour friends to dress up like video game characters jump off some buildings and you can write Devon yes you can have a talk

think this is so though you don't need gear you don't need trucks or a crane you don't need some big expensive camera rig than everyone when you're a creator you don't need someone here here telling you what you can and can't do all right is that way what you can and can't say I accidentally did the shocker oh my god they call us gamers influencers internet famous what the fuck does that mean but we know something they don't you can start a blog or a makeup press will table on the role in the Technic piano playing in beautiful places for interested people when you're a creator all you need is your phone an internet connection and a good idea a story you want to share something you need to say is written here I'm in the rest your history [Music] if you do it right you get to quit the day job make friends from places you've never been meet a collaboration princess boys if your video camera a light moving so fast and so full you won't even have time to profit so to my fellow creators I

think of these those are dope dude it's an individual [Music] then getting some getting some serious hot sweaty humid miles in this morning I'm good baby let's go how's that bathroom go right here go right here I haven't talked about the Tesla yet I will do the Tesla but I want to do a whole tech review Tuesday about the Tesla but this week's tech review Tuesday not any other Tesla I've got something else in mind no no the next wait yes turn your turn here did you get one yet okay tech review Tuesday this is a first for tech review Tuesday this is a sponsored tech review Tuesday which means it's not a real review it's more like first looked tech review Tuesday but I have something here that was just announced this morning I think I'm the first person to have it maybe they did this with other youtubers too but I'm very excited about remember Segway Segway has a totally new Segway coming out that apparently fits in this box and they seventh one they didn't just send me one dude I just thought I was gonna be foaming today no no this one's for you pause it dude looks like a helmet do you wear it on your head they did send me like their promotional video [Music] [Applause] all I was able to deduce from that promotional video is that these are little mini segways that go under each foot that you ride like rollerskates you got this well let me see if I can get over this hump yep let's see if I can get on the hallway okay alright so looking at the hardware this thing say it's like not much bigger than an actual shoe it's heavy it feels dense I don't know six or seven pounds how many pounds you think this thing weighs three kilograms it's got two little handles on the bottom the wheel is not like a hoverboard wheel it doesn't have air in it so it's solid they charge right here the regular charger the charger does have a double dongle so you can charge both at the same time and that's kind of it there's one button here that turns it on I don't think this tables level but it does balance by it this will be a real-world test of the Segway can handle these streets but it's definitely not as fun there's like a perfectly smooth like indoor I think these things would be amazing in an airport or something like that [Music] going uptown [Music] all right we are now in the biggest room in New York City with the smoothest floor in New York City I was like a plainclothes policeman very polite though we'll have to test these elsewhere 34th and 7 thank you [Music] all right now we are in New York City's Penn Station not as nice of a station not as nice of a room but the floors are just as smooth I get absolutely for Celia having these in my backpack or something when I go to an airport I'm pretty used to no look no flinching just don't look stepped in exactly I'm just floating on a car [Music] pretty nimble pretty smooth and uh good for crowds I feel like I'm on rollerskates [Music] alright so that concludes that concludes this first look at the UH at the Segway drift w1 Segway thank you for sending me these thank you for giving me the opportunity to look at these things first Thanks Segway [Music]", "label": "G"}, {"data": "[Music] so what's happening here I happen to be in Toronto for work engagement I got back from Amsterdam where Pierre was with me in Amsterdam like yesterday we both posted fun videos this morning of us hanging out Amsterdam now everybody has all these questions everybody wants more and more more it's like here do you have like an hour cuz I've got a lunch break for my work thing and we're making movies but this isn't this isn't your house no this is my house I wish it was my house we're gonna be allowed to use it uh-huh we're gonna break into it the best ever there in Japan right now and they're like yeah talk to the guy at the front desk and maybe you make it happen [Music] yes and no make your apartments there it's 1257 now I feed back my cheese that's doable right planning space plenty of space doing fine I know the face you're giving the camera Peter you are a much much much better cinematographer than you are plenty of room planning room you got it Lanny roof and we're good thank you thank you look at that Park job okay thank you Wow look at that you imma cannon slide in here is there any light on my face I don't know those I like that frame you could see the tower behind us they're great let me just cheat yourself I got a little close with this thing's all wobbly so largely because we only have a short amount of time but also because Peters such an aficionado when it comes to cinematography and camera gear and and all those things I thought it might be an appropriate Q&amp;A ready I'm ready Butch Hartman question we want to do a collab with me yes I do but Hartman that's the guy that drew Fairly OddParents you know this guy I know this guy [Music] right yeah we're gonna do a hundo peak lab what are mistakes you see people making with storytelling I think a misconception of storytelling is that you need like a hero and a villain and it has to be like a classical like you know a plot whereas a story can just be something very basic from moving from point A to point B doesn't to be so literal that's right that's right it's my thinking that best Airport you've been to probably Hong Kong or I like to Amsterdam oh oh no no Doha it has a swimming pool in it oh hands-down winner [Music] so Dan asks when shooting a vlog are all of your shots done in sequence or do you film a talking ahead segment then go back and b-roll and my answer to that is I don't always shoot in sequence no in fact the video that I made yesterday of us in the Amsterdam so the anchor that videos me interviewing you we shot that the next day and then I used that as like a narrative bed for the rest of the episode yeah there's tons of times where I actually film a vlog over like three days time and I wear the same clothes and then just cut it in to make it feel like it was all done the same day Rick wants to know when do you guys get married we're not I think they're getting the wrong I don't understand that we like to collaborate in the videos we've made one video interesting how do you feel the people looking at you as a crazy person when you're talking into a camera I find it very hard if you're worried that much about what people think of you you probably should not try to be a youtuber I mean there's always something a little weird about it oh it's weird you just gotta oh yeah oh yeah try vlogging with a GoPro on your head that's the most weird it's ever been for me what color profile do you use Casey no answer I have no idea yeah okay I shoot flat so if I had a log color profile on my cameras I would use that but I shoot everything flat so that it color grades better in post he's good when you sit down out of the vlog do you have an entire idea of how you want the entire thing to play out or do you dive in headfirst and see what you can create I almost always know before I start to edit what I'm doing but I assemble it and I really tighten up the story in the Edit I need to be better at that because I a lot of the time just like fly by the seat of my pants I'm starting to edit and I'm like oh I like where this is going and then I have some ideas but that is not my preferred method of creating I would much rather have it planned we gotta go let's go we gotta go this is the Q&amp;A is not over we got to go to the whose apartment is this melissa alejandro dear Melissa I don't think Jim listen Alejandra thank you for letting us use your apartment it was a great [Music] you got this all right right back right right back keep it straight you got it straight you're good plenty of distance 75 feet six suck it up funny his face cut the wheel straighten her out cut the wheel the other way straighten her out turn the wheel you know that scene and Austin Powers as a youtuber how do you create original content when it seems like everything has already been done yeah I'll hit that one off you have to tell your story if I've told all of my stories and piers told all of his stories which neither of us have it doesn't change the fact that nobody knows your story so the written language has been around since hieroglyphics thousands of years there are still new stories being told every single day not everything's been done it's up to you to find your own voice on YouTube and nobody can do that better than you that was good that was like I was I feel like I was being kind of aggressive there and then you were kind of like the super nice just want to bring it home you know I'm headed back to my event now great question here do you see Peter as a competitor or as a friend no as a friend but I said anything about all youtubers anyone who works in the space is big as YouTube and thinks that somebody else's success is gonna slow them down is sorely mistaken YouTube is not at all a zero-sum game it is the more people who can succeed on this platform the more we will all succeed on this platform like simply put the Internet is big enough for everyone yeah are you coming to the event with me I'm just gonna walk in I don't have a pass for you I used to be a magician [Music] great a great day Canada dude good to see you thank you taking me up thanks for all of your questions and answers thanks for asking the questions and also helping me answer hit it I'll see you soon [Music] [Music]", "label": "G"}, {"data": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] take game Jenga or you're like you have all the pieces stacked on

that I'm actually very excited about [Music] skills sound [Music] I haven't actually talked about it in the vlog yet but I'm actually starting another it's small right now it's like I'm starting another like technology company tech endeavor there's just something about software development that's so exciting I'd really missed it since beam so this is a meeting about that but more on that later hope everyone's okay three things three things have been on my mind all day they've really been occupying me so here goes number one very very very good news I am typically not an emotional person but this news makes me want to cry a little bit I found this out last night for the first time in my whole life I am now an uncle yesterday there was a new addition to the nice stat brood a beautiful healthy baby and everyone's doing great and it's very exciting that's been like this little dopamine thing in my brain all day that's just like happiness happiness happiness number two and I don't know how to feel about this I guess I'm like okay I shared with you like a week ago or two weeks ago about my grandmother passing away which is really just sad and a real bummer but this weekend instead of a regular traditional funeral the entire family the extended family is getting together up in New England like six hours from New York City I feel okay about it because while it's very sad it her not being here is very sad and her passing was very sad but the act of celebrating it as a big family is very positive and I do feel good about that so that's number three this is just straight-up bad very bad news last night Dan was in a pretty bad accident he's he's fine not life-threatening and he broke his shoulder I've spoken to him he called me last night to tell me even though he can't move his arms he still wants to smack it I don't know what that means so he's okay but it's still bad he was hurt [Music] I'm not gonna be uploading tomorrow I've had a crash dan I told you not to ride my skateboards when it rains out because you're gonna break them and because it's dangerous and you fell off my skateboard and you broke yourself congratulations you played yourself [Music] so my physician [Music] I heard you weren't feeling well thank you my sir how are you doing man I'm like a Bray are you on pain pills right now yeah you look terrible yeah yes I'm trying to make myself look nice dad what are you taking sir trying t this poor guy tell me what happened buddy very busy so I've said goodbye to you and you were like you're like watch out on that booster board that's not what I said what did you say I said don't ride my boosted board in the rain that's exactly what I said it and then I was like I was thinking like how many times have I done this you know and I was going along and then I I was pushing it full force like I was just headed home you know it was pouring rain like a thunderstorm okay continue and I I was hitting in the bike lane and then his black car just pulled out of no it's just like it just came out into the bike lane and then I slammed on brakes but obviously like it was wet so but like I slammed and brake side like it it was sliding towards the car and I was thinking like oh my I'm gonna hit into the car so I tried to jump out of the way of the car but then I slipped and I went and I was heading for it's wheel and then I pushed my arm up against the side and that's what it when it snapped and the car just like drove off and then somebody else called the M you know there's lots of people standing around yeah then I was in the hospital most of last night and so now I have to wait because obviously if if I need an operation I'm gonna have to go back to South Africa [Music] feel better damn thank you myself I'm so sorry of course I'm so sorry you're hurt dude we interrupt this program to bring you a special report what's a per mole or booty who hunted her I just said hello in in three

feelings I flew to South Africa to get a hug from my mom pretty much but I'll be back in New York City in the next few days and I'll be back on my booster board and cruising with you very soon my sir I miss you so much I mean for realsies dog peace Tony [Music]", "label": "#"}, {"data": "it's not clickbait I really am ending the vlog yes I'm starting a proper daily vlog I'm psyched so this is the first vlog entry but let me start this morning back in New York City yeah I was a I was a youtuber before I was a vlogger and I was a filmmaker before I was a youtuber I'm not gonna give any of that up it's just this the last whatever 18 months 500 600 videos this experiment it's over [Music] you know what I when I think back to why I started this vlog I spent so much of that time sitting here talking to you about this premise about this idea that I need to challenge myself creatively and I've gotten lazy on this platform and it hadn't been posting and by issuing a mandate to post every single day I would challenge myself creatively in a way I had never done before and that's exactly what happened and I think for the first year of doing this I felt that fire under my ass I felt that challenge every single day I woke up every day thinking what can I do today to make the greatest video possible well then you see how famous you are now really you see this oh that's nice that's nice that's nice the most famous UPS Meru internet celebrity Marlon man you know what's gonna happen up here though right it's gonna be Marlon and Casey yeah and I don't know I can probably like six months ago something like that it started to get easy I found a rhythm I found a system for approaching this daily video that was no longer a challenge and this vlog I feel like turned into the one thing that I didn't want it to be when I started which is just me making a little video about what my day was every single day the creative challenge faded away something easier took its place and then that easier thing was exasperated by wild success on YouTube since starting this blog have earned over five million subscribers I've done over a billion views since starting this vlog and that success combined with kind of a creative complacency I think yielded something that I don't like something I'm not proud of which is that like I know how to do this and do it in a way that's pretty easy and have it make me very successful on YouTube and make a great living via Adsense and and grow this reach but what it hasn't been doing is challenging me it hasn't been the creative fistfight that I want and need every single day and the more I wrestle with how to find that creative challenge the more I realize I will never find it as long as 16 hours out of my 24 hour day I'm dedicated to to uploading this daily video I have to kill this before I can give birth to what's next [Music] [Music] it's like my favorite metaphor which is like that Tarzan metaphor that I talk about it's a couldn't be more appropriate this idea that like life or career my career is this huge jungle that I'm trying to navigate my way through and the only way to get from one side of the jungle to the other the only way to get to where I want to be in my career is by swinging from vine to vine and grabbing onto that next opportunity that next vine to take me closer to where I want to be and the trouble with success is that it makes you very comfortable and look in September inside of 128 day window I did a hundred and fifty five million views and I earned one point 1 million subscribers that's a kind of YouTube success that is like I could have never imagined when I started and that makes you very comfortable that kind of success sends me good just keep doing what I'm doing right now and this success will continue but that means holding on to that one vine in the jungle and not reaching for what's next and and the more I thought about like how am I going to progress my career how am I going to figure out what how is my career going to evolve how am I going to figure out what's next in my career the more I realize I have to first let go of this vine before I can grab on to what's next [Music] and when I think of risk I think of like I think of like my 19 year old self abandoning my job in Connecticut and running to New York City with nothing and taking a big chance on this dream to become a filmmaker but in success and look I'm 35 years 35 years old and I make a great living doing what I love I think I found some degree of success in my life when you found success risk it's a whole lot different because risk means jeopardizing what you've earned what you have and giving up this vlog is is certainly risk this is a tremendous risk but the thing that this vlog has yielded is opportunity by reaching almost 5 million people a day via this channel via this it's presented me with just this tidal wave of opportunity and the more I look around at that opportunity and the more I think of what do I want out of my career do I want to be making vlogs when I'm 40 years old and the answer is no like a career is always about progress it's never arriving in one place and staying there I've always approached everything with that mentality certainly when I think of the long game that is my career this was a big stepping stone but this was not the finish line and that's a really scary thing to admit to yourself especially when my channel is still growing but that's not enough of a reason to not embrace something new and that's exactly what I'm doing and what I'm doing next is a whole nother video that I will dive into and share the intimacy's of with you but it's time to embrace a new opportunity it's time to push for something else because the success of this vlog has not satiated my appetite it's only made me more hungry this is the most literal example of that platitude I love to share that is with each success comes a bigger more ambitious goal with the success of this vlog it has only made me hungrier and I'm acting on that right now by moving on from this from this blog you can do it so what does that mean for this channel well first I'm not giving up YouTube at all I will be uploading I will be uploading regularly I will continue to pump out videos but different kinds of videos the kinds of videos that take a little thinking more than a day to produce the kinds of videos that have to really envelop myself in before I can make thank you for coming along with me on this journey that has been the last year and a half thank you for letting me share my life and my perspectives and my ideas with you and that's kind of it stopping is not easy I thought about going to like two episodes a week or three episodes a week but then I realized I can't grab on to what's next unless I completely let go of this so the only way to truly move on is just to drop the mic so with that [Music] [Applause] [Music] who's gonna tell you when it's [Music] who's gonna tell you things aren't so [Music] the world [Music]", "label": "G"}, {"data": "uh-oh before this video began it's time for me to flex on your kids I got a brand-new origin PC

try to make it harder for my poor hard way so when NASA first started sending astronauts into space they realized that the ballpoint pen would not work at zero gravity a million dollar investment in two years of test result in a pen that could ride in space upside down on almost any surface and at temperatures ranging from below bottle and when confronted with the same problem the Russians used a pencil in the early is a space like those Russians and Americans use pencils in space and fortunately pencil that is made of graphite a highly conductive material snap reflect light sand particles in zero-gravity are hugely problematic as they will get sucked into the air ventilation or electronic equipment easily causing shorts or fires and a few oxygen environment of the capsule after the phone

While youtube flags content inappropriate for young audiences by requiring viewers to sign in, a lot of youtube content is generally unaudited if the uploader of the video does not flag it so. Also there is no distinction between which content is appropriate for what age groups. We will classify content based the film rating system: G, PG, PG-13 and R. We will also apply a binary classification for classifying clickbait videos."}
