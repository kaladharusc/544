withholding from from sharing I didn't mean for that to sound so nefarious it's actually like it's a super positive thing a really super focused lately on maximizing every minute of every day and I know that's like a common theme for everything i do especially these blogs but lately i've been doing it would like a renewed focus they're like there are two aspects of my life that are constantly in conflict and that is my desire to like work more to do more to accomplish more which fights up against like what is an entirely objective pragmatic reality there's only 24 hours in the day to drop time like money is fungible if each one of these 12 quarters represents two hours of every day if I want to dedicate less time to say i don't know being in the office in more time to save the family it means taking from over here to put it over here now a while ago I made a movie of law called fat and lazy if you haven't seen it you should check it out where it outlines like what my day looks like how I maximize each and every day but a reality that I've encountered recently as I need more I really want to get back to like marathon training I want to focus more on the edits for these blogs now you spend a lot more time at being headquarters what I've been trying to do is rather than focus on the quantity of the hours focus on the quality of the hours like how can I literally give myself more energy and i know this line of thinking who quickly devolved into some weird like a cult thing but it's not that basically it's that if I can be more efficient with each and every minute of every day I can accomplish more in the same amount of time and what that means is all essentially be creating more time with the same amount of time there's not a lot of latitude here I don't have a lot of extra space to pull from so I'm tackling my diet I really want to up my diet I want to perfect everything that I eat everything that i can assume i'm starting with like sugar no candy no junk food none of that crap i'm also working with a personal trainer two days a week to make my legs stronger so i can run faster and that's kind of it is not that big of a deal i did want to introduce it into the blog though because I'm very honest with you the audience of this blog and if I screw up and like eat say a eight boxes of pop tarts I would just tell you I was shared on the vlog in this level of accountability I think will make me more committed to staying healthy a grounding whipped cream is supposed to have 370 calories the actual count was 3 98.9 this is a movie that made for the New York Times a couple years ago and I like go and buy all this food that has the calorie amount written on it and then I worked the food scientists in a laboratory where we use like it was a colorful a bomb calorimeter to determine the exact calorie content that was in the food and it was like some of the things were off like crazy like look at this this sandwich here that we tested here actual calorie content was nearly doubling with the legal saying giving this sandwich about the same amount of calories as a big mac not cool crazy right I'm gonna be there I'm gonna take the skateboard alright so I

at me but after I've run for like fifty five minutes ready ok that was seven and a half miles at a 720 pace one outside to look at the sweat by the way this tom brady shirt Tom Brady gives me personally so it's kind of special to me yeah yeah yeah my days are so much better when i run in the morning matt is back today he's been out for three days for his birthday and today is back looking forward to seeing the guy you want to try it No how's the vacation is fantastic yeah ok questions and answers Casey what happened to your Apple watch ah I broke the metal part that connects the band to the watch itself not apple's fault I like totally messed with it and customize it and I thought my skateboard broke it i ordered a new generic part and it just hasn't shown up yet so a big fan of the Apple watch would you risk your own life to save someone in need like stopping an armed robber run into a fire to save a random child I mean of course I'm going to say yes but you don't know the answer that question until you're in that situation kind of a crazy question and I can solace what do you think about the comfort zone I think it's the worst place you could ever be when you're hungry you want more when you're wildly successful you can embrace your hard work and be proud of it when you're in the comfort zone it's just do you feel pressure to always record everything from your life No and the truth is like I don't record that much I do shoots for the blog like a pretty small amount of the day like I need something to be happening in order to record it and then I put that into a story i call it a blog i posted on YouTube it's never recording the whole day Alex asks other than hard work what advice would you give to better yourself both in life and in your career field focus focus is super underrated like if you commit all that you are and all your energy to one thing you'll be okay that's like this time around this is I took this from a book called I don't know what it's called but it goes like this right you can do 10 things to like the first degree like this right here and that's how well you'll do all ten things where you can do one thing to the tenth degree right there and look how much better you do that so when it comes to focus to put all of your energy into one thing is to do that one thing really well the best of your abilities to take it all the way and to scatter yourself means you're never actually accomplishing anything you just sort of chipping away at a bunch of nothingness and this is true for work this is true for like dating vs committing yourself to one person friendship everything like really focusing and invest in yourself into something you're passionate about will always yield better results then scattering yourself around then spreading yourself thin if you could do it all again would you change anything fun question I'm not really into hypotheticals I'm very rooted in reality and where I am right now and to look back and say I would have done this differently would mean that i might not be in the position I'm in right now and I'm really happy with the progress 78 in life so much more about looking forward and thinking what can I do now to affect my future that i am looking at my passing i wish i had done this can you sing I wish I could sing I wish I could say I wish I could dance I can do neither Josh asks how much of yourself you see a known as far as personalities and mannerisms and what not a lot but I mean I try to emulate oh and i think more so than he tries to emulate me Owen is definitely a better person that I am is more considerate and thoughtful and concerned with other people who needs i would say they're much more selfish than Owen and that's the quality in him I admire the most so I try more to be like my kid that I would say my kid tries to be like me and as a parent that's like I feel pretty great about that does it get annoying having kids wait outside your office annoying I've never invited anyone to stand outside my office and the reason why I go visit them outside is because I feel guilty i'm always flattered and always really excited about the fact that people respond to the movies and make so much they want to meet me so I would never like say no or be mean or discourage but this is a place of business like we have 11 people working next door on being there is a lot going on here and I'm working really hard to make this work so the distraction is unwelcomed and I try to do meet ups at our last meet up we bought 500 pizza it's like we try to do cool things like that all in i would say don't come visit me here I really like it's a big distraction I will say though that when kids come into this building and come outside my office door that is not cool at all we're trying to work in here we're having meetings in your conference calls like this is a very productive very busy company here and having kids knock on the door cause I think it's funny or cute or clever or that their special is completely unwelcomed and not cool and pisses me off because it lacks any respect for who I am as a professional I would never show up at your office I would never knock on the door of your classroom and come in there and say hi and ask for a selfie because that's your space I hope that doesn't sound too harsh like i said i really value and have such an appreciation for people that respond to my work so profoundly that love meeting new people but boundaries and respect is something I hold dear and I expect that from others ok that's it for today's Q&A one of my favorite things always is meeting the youtubers today Benji is here and we're doing a little interview for Benji's new YouTube channel which is called ng video influencers but we also have a daily blog my wife and knock it's Judy's life so ok i'll link both channels below and but for Benji's in political video influencers blog we're doing like a an interview right now and just got it set up this is Benji's microphone is so Emma I like I'm almost embarrassed about this but I try to go simple you know try not to go too overboard my production anyways you can see the interview on

            "subtitles": "very exciting morning this morning when toward preschools for Francine which is going to start in the fall I never did well in school also never did well when I had a job working for someone else I don't do well in environments where I don't agree with the structure for the curriculum but the minute i was in a place where i was left to my own devices where I had agency over what I did I thrived now I know friends scene is only 13 months old but you know she's fifty percent my DNA and I think that she's probably the same as meat check out these leases that made for my gloves Francine as inform it until now I haven't for my gloves I made out of hair ties I think do I didn't do you a last week because it was like the giveaway day so I want to do I want to do you mean eight whoo I want to donate I'm technical question do you watch the leftover footage after you edit your vlogs do you delete it or D store i watch all the footage that I shoot and then I don't delete anything I saved every clip I've ever shot for every single blog what's the biggest lesson you've learned from filmmaking on youtube ought to be honest especially on youtube if you are bored or people your viewers on YouTube they will sniff it out there is no room there's no room for making stuff up on YouTube well our again check this out what it is this awesome ok thank you you too what's up with your glasses are you new viewer I've made like 10 videos about these glasses did you expect vlogging to progress your channel the way it is done ah my youtube channel has gone from a half a million subscribers to now closing on two million subscribers it did that in less than a year and it started when i started blogging no I definitely did not expect that to happen but it is like a big part of the reason why I keep blogging audience keep showing up so people keep subscribing it's like that is the greatest motivator to keep making will you come to Mexico soon I don't think so i am going to be in Florida this weekend can I messed up let me just check this and put a different lens on there I hope that looks I hope that looks better next question I just want to know if you're happy at the moment I love that question yes i'm extremely happy at the moment and well no that's not true no I'm it is true I'm happy right now but I'm you have to scratch the surface to get there and what that means is asked me how I'm doing I'm like a little bit frustrated right now I have to get so much work done by the end of the day I'm worried about getting Francine to that school we visited this morning I have all this stress but then I stopped and I'm like wait really though and then I appreciate I have nothing to be anything but happy about Sergio asks have you ever tried minecraft no I've never played Minecraft that I will say one of my fantasies is to have enough time in my life which i don't have right now have enough time so i could start a gaming channel on youtube because I think they're fascinated what makes you so confident and comfortable about being so very open about your address and where you are the world's a lot of youtubers tend to be very private about such information and I'm wondering if I feel comfortable sharing my address because this is my office this is my studio this is where I make movies most youtubers work out of their home which necessitates much more privacy than this especially because i love filming in the streets around here it this neighborhood is my set for this blog why don't you wear a wedding ring ah it's not because I don't want people to know married i'm just not I don't like jewelry Kansas has never asked me so I don't know whatever k see how do you stay positive when life gets you down think how do you stay positive life gets you down well it's it's not easy no let me let me tell let me tell story here a lot is any way you've inspired this story I would describe my most formative years that is when i was a kid as like incredibly frustrated and angry and negative and all those things that I push back against so hard now and the reason why is because i was living in someone else's world meaning they're all these rules and all these teachers and parents and bosses and all of these external forces dictating what I couldn't what I couldn't do it in that environment I just freaked out and it was because I freaked out that I i moved to new york city and i was like i'm going to figure this out I'm going to find my own way and how that manifested what that turn into is creating this world that I now live in its I feel like I live in this is my world I'm in control so how I stay positive in life gets me down is I have so many resources I have so many different ways to express myself and change things so when life gets me down that's my fault and it's my responsibility to change it and leave the most important thing there is that we all have little things in our lives that we are in control of so in life when external forces get you down you fall back on the things that you are in control of that's why I'm such like so passionate about having some sort of creative expression to me it's movies having outlet is really helpful all right it's always like one person that i really get excited about their question and then that dictates all of QA this guy's outside kids outside I don't really know what to expect but he's been contacted me for a while and I think it's like a gymnast parkour guy or something I don't know to expect but like meeting new people welcome to this video then famous studio very cool how do we get in touch why did this happen and I kind of remember i mean i think i hit you I was trying to record some tricks in the studio right that thing's the best though the one wheel is the most fun these things are bad these hoverboard I used on them yeah they just explode the one wheel is really great everything you think you can trick in here how do you do that in such a small space with it slow down at all - I thought all summer long trying to learn how to do that on a trampoline and I really got it I think it on the truck leaned actually fall don't put it on get in then what we could do is I can I could fly the drone in here so you get some like aerial shots like actually yeah you wanna do that what's going on here is tiles about to do some tricking and we want to get some like birds eye view footage of it so I know I said I would never do it again I'm gonna do it again I'm gonna fly the drone in here just really simple straight up shoot straight down cause you can do is flips and then bring it down gently no trouble today from me the drones gonna be fine no problem all right ready yeah yeah DJ i emailed me and told me how to shut these things down in a crisis which I do appreciate it worked perfectly drone is perfectly fine that just broke another blade not a big deal these things are amazing to the worse yeah the file is a pleasure thank you sorry about the whole grown thing pretty fun yeah what I'm NC travel nice to meet you too have the lips were really cool also wish I had broken my growing again next time I say I'm never going to fly the drone inside remind me not to fly the drone inside",

today is a huge deal for three reasons let me pull the part number one today is my 35th birthday 35 that is insane I'm 35 years old number two it's a big deal because i'm moving today another 32 there is one year of organ let's work backwards let's talk about one year of vlogging before it started blogging at youtube channel for five years and in those five years and a whole bunch of huge viral hits movies the family 15 16 million views but my subscriber growth was anemic the channel growth is anemic flat like that five years 500,000 subscribers then I started uploading daily and in five months I 500,000 more subscribers that's 1 million subscribers five years of the first five hundred thousand five months for the second 500,000 so I kept uploading and two months later I had another half a million subscribers now here I am one year after doing daily uploads and I've got two and a half million subscribers YouTube isn't Hollywood I'm not Stanley Kubrick you can't succeed here if you're uploading once a month if you want to succeed here you've got a shot for work every single day that that took me five years to learn I didn't start daily vlogging to grow my youtube channel I did it as a way to kill all those excuses i used that kept me from making more movies because it every single inflection point in my life doing the work has always been the thing has always been the catalyst that took me from where I am to where I wanted to be what's up guys don't mind you back home again one two three she's oh my gosh - I don't think I don't want you guys take care guys mar 2015 2016 I turned 35 years old I can no longer and listen the US Marine Corps but I can't run for president and let's be clear about one thing 35 is the oldest don't listen to any of that book about I don't feel my age i feel like i'm a teenager no way yes i can do it standing backflip yes I can cross the street walking on my hands and I can run a marathon before my morning coffee but I am old and I feel old the physical aspect of aging aside i want to tell you a story my first job in New York is a bike messenger my second job in New York was working for this guy who was like a big deal and the first time I ever went out I ever went out in the city was to his 35th birthday and you have to understand i was like this 20 year old loser then I literally was washing dishes like two months earlier and now i'm at this like big to-do birthday party and they were like insanely beautiful women there and all the dudes were dress really well and everybody was getting drunk and I thought wait a place I just remember i remember looking at my boss feeling tiny and thinking when I'm his age I want to be as big of a deal as he is now I gave up on that years ago you could never compare yourself to other people in life but i do remember that feeling of standing at the bottom of a huge mountain staring up and it feeling seemingly impossible to get to where I wanted to go in the last 15 years I've learned it's not but it takes a lot of work and a long time so I Casey this is xavier Anderson regulations on your 360 fit in de mi tell ya thanks same here you got it getting a new apartment in New York City is a huge deal to understand this I got to tell you the whole story before i moved to new york city i was living like two hours away from the city now come in to like make videos with my brother and their get back on the train your back this is my first apartment didn't matter what the apartment was just the idea of having a place to lay my head down in New York City was the hugest deal for me it wasn't really much of a department that door all the way in there that door in the back that was my first apartment it's not even fair to call this my first apartment this is a three-month subway somebody else's apartment I got to stay in for three months and this sublet was a studio apartment a two hundred square foot studio apartment here's the door you can fit one queen-size bed in there no bedrooms or anything and then he was the toilet here is the shower but it was this two hundred square foot studio apartment converted to a two bedroom so here is my bedroom he was a total strangers better than live with this bedroom was so small i had a futon in there that i couldn't lay flat I had to sleep on it in the couch position because the room was too small delay at flat when that three month sublet was up and moved on to a friend's couch in this building right here that was sep tember 1 2001 ten days later terrorist attack the world trade centers that were right here now it's hard to tell but this building is one and a half blocks from the world trade center and when that attack happened this apartment was destroyed everything was wrecked that's a real trade center right there burning that's that's 20 year old Casey scared out of his mind riding my bike up the west side highway to get away from me get away from the towers to get my stuff back i did dress up like a construction worker will pass all the security go past ground 0 which is just a smoldering pile on sep tember 12 and break into my own apartment to get back all of my things and then I like after I legit had nowhere to stay that was I had no home so I moved in with my brother than and his girlfriend they lived in this apartment here and i slept on their hardwood floor for a while they live in the top floor and there's no elevator about your up and down these steps because this place right here at great eats up then i bribe my way into a place uptown it was way uptown it was all I could afford it was a s ro that stands for a single room occupancy what that man a 12 foot by 12 foot room with no bathroom and no kitchen the bathroom is down the hall and you shared it with the entire floor now this is all I can afford but it was it was mine but it was the dichotomy of that place the fact that i had a place that was mine but was the worst living situation I could have so it's dying to get out dying to move to a better place but unlike the three month sublet there was nobody kicking me out I could have conceivably stayed there forever the hardest part of living in that SRO was Owen he was like a little baby at the time and when he would wake up in the middle of the night and have to go to the bathroom i don't have to wake up with him and hold his hand and walk down the hallway and hold that there was no stranger in the bathroom or that it wasn't a mess so he could go to the bathroom and then walk him back see my response what you got most people's first years in the city you don't live in the city you just survive and that was my stitches eventually left there and then i moved with some friends that I moved into a tiny apartment than a slightly bigger apartment in a slightly bigger apartment I've literally moved every two years the last 15 years the movers are on lunch break I'm going to have a quick feet it's kind of sad I remember when we first brought the crib into this room really happening and this absolutely wonderful apartment that we live in now it's canvases apartment she picked it out she got it she designed it this is her apartment but the new place the new place is my apartment I picked it out it's my name on the lease I'm providing my family with this apartment that's a huge deal I'm no longer that 20-year old kid looking at his boss saying someday my focus is laser set on the future I'm not looking back all I see are bigger scarier mountains that I will climb and stop at nothing to get the top of total moving crisis right now the movers are especially out of the old place by noon moving into the new place by one and be done at the new place by six that Marlon no I'm there's nothing to be done the new place by six o'clock they just left the old place and it's 6:30 so I need to know if they're gonna let them move into the new place because it's so late and like they got everything from my underwear to my mattress to my pillow that's your goal you can be sleeping in the Halle Berry three movers are never going to be finished but there were that plastic wrap ordinary or in the movies fact that we want to but just because we have nowhere else to go we've seen 10 we saw 10 Cloverfield Lane do you like it yeah it was so good but it's now ridiculously late they're still out of the apartment I don't know - do we know sorry you have to sleep on before we don't have that free and get one soon night your bucks just to my hand",

trip from New York to Florida and close like poop like my toilets to be stationary roughing it is not something can't you see you're good at or enjoys it smells like you can I feel like we fought like we didn't talk for a few days after the trip we fought on the trip I know but I feel like after it was like I don't know if I can hang out with this guy anymore there's no sure way to find out whether you like someone or hate them and then to travel with it let me that's harsh let's finish the movie now pre-trip interview I'm excited as excited as could be maybe you don't know this have literally never address this but I had braces like until that a year ago in this movie was shot right before I got those braces and look at the crookedness of these key like a hillbilly they're getting crooked again next year are your retainer I need to wear my retainer ok back we stopped at a hotel maybe we're all set it really negates the whole point of having an RV if you don't sleep in it no yes we did make that agreement i would never have gone on it know what thinking that we were going to sleep and drive in that thing for 36 hours this scene which was shot on three ipods where it's all choreographed with us on three ipods that that was shot way after the fact that that's definitely my favorite scene in the whole movie for a good part of our adult lives we've been stuck in this cycle it's the same story you heard a million times at first everything is all love you great then a little tension a pull and we both walk away we break up a little time and we forget why we were mad yeah with little effort we're back together it breaks off it feels so real so permanent but time heals all and again we forget then now here we are just a little just pause a little product there's no way that I could capture in any movie just how to mulch with our relationship was until we got married I mean in like six years we probably broke up six times at least I mean like serious breakouts really seeing other people breakups and like I had to go get a tattoo break up and like get skinny hot break up but to get me back yeah just like that that's what girls do when you pick up your scanning are you just a little you know what were we talking about before I interrupted you the context is something funny like it don't you think like you get mad at people that is the real killer like that I should be with somebody a little I can't imagine my life without you it was a really gnarly relationship the kind of relationship where your friends are like oh I don't want to ever hear that name again yeah and then my sisters like you will end up together my moms like just leave him alone and Marcie's like I can't deal with you anymore and then everything worked out now we have like the most perfect happiness me courage ever because we literally almost broke up yesterday yeah and every day yeah yeah you want to not fight on a trip like this I never want to fight ever but there was a lot left ignored we've been broken up for a while plus we haven't slept much and I've done a terrible job planning and canvas it better putting its board about we shot that movie in 2011 I didn't put that online and told 2013 the reason why is I knew the minute I put online that I was gonna have to propose to you and then marry you but why do you think that well because i think that like by brew leasing that putting that in the public there's a level of accountability there and if i were to make a movie like that about you and show the world that means I couldn't date anyone else has just say that the things you wouldn't be able to date anyone else no way yeah yeah yeah yeah all right I think that's it i hope you enjoyed this behind the seat Candace brought an entire bag of cookies for this little like screening project and she's really doing a hell of a job why would you open the bag like that it's easier to get to them this that that is why this marriage death that is why this marriage you know i will open up the box of Lucky Charms gesture and you opened it from the bottom how do you how is this they're supposed to work if that's the kind of behavior i have to deal with she toured the cookie back open from the side who does that yeah hi did you apply this dog is 14 years old so we should put on the blog more because she's a senior citizen",

the scraping are you uncomfortable showing your eyes know what spray paint brandi is ah krylon the spray-painted champions why do you make your nice glasses look like they came from the dollar store well I think nice is in the eye of the beholder that was the plan words i think these glasses are nicer because I made them then some glasses that were made in italy in a factory just because their new doesn't mean they're nice I don't think those are nice i think those are generic these are mine how do you keep them clean I don't throw is filthy do you sleep with them on no but they're usually on my bedside table when i wake up here's a good question Oscar asks why do you buy real expensive ray-bans remove the logo instead of buying cheap fake words because these are actually higher quality glasses what makes a Mercedes or Lamborghini nice is not just the thing that says mercedes lamborghini it's actually a better car if you're right Lamborghini on a Hyundai it wouldn't be a Lamborghini would be a Hyundai that says Lamborghini so these are actually really good quality glasses that's glass not plastic in their top and I wear them every day and they don't break usually so I like to wear good glasses I just don't like the name brand so i take it off Casey when are you going to make another pair how about right now making these things it's not that hard I don't know how many pair of made over the years the truth is I don't lose them and they don't really break but they do expire it's like all the balance in the plastic that makes up the frame it just starts to stretch out in time right now I'm scraping the logo off of the lens see what I have a tendency to lose things and i'm making me so I've got a fresh pair and then this old parent here will become my back up here just taking out the logo there you will paint in it the last step here just hit them with the tape you break every rule spray painting is what you wanted you wanted to sink into the cracks II just flooded with me that is the sloppiest worst spray paint job you'll ever seen you do now I'll just leave them there to sit over night when I wake up in the morning I'll strip the paint off and they look kind of like these probably just a touch more paint now the biggest question that I get asked is why why do I always wear sunglasses the first part of the answer is I just like the glasses look there's a really pragmatic reason ok you know how when I'm talking to camera i'm talking camera right now I can always point at things like hey look at this screen right here or come out these lights behind me or check out this blue lunch box right here or this movie poster movie produced right there The Godfather it's right here I'm not looking into the lens i'm looking into this screen right here and now i can frame things up I know what I'm looking at but what I do with my glasses off I don't look like I'm looking at you I look over here so like imagine if in all my blogs I'm looking like this it starts to feel really weird I can look at here and then look over there try to pretend to look over there but in the end it's just like if i want to point this I can either look over here or I look here and just sort of guess but what I have classes on it always looks like i'm looking at camera so that's why I started wearing glasses and all my blogs it's like a really practical reason that's why i was having fun at night is just like it's the only way I can check my framing without having to look weird I would see when people log and they're not looking into the lens it's like it did it doesn't what about my class about your they're awesome but you want to know what not nothing was young you up with them on them because your eyes are so cute and pretty and then you cover them with these glasses I know what you're talking about just such pretty brown just like my glasses ok that's it will you help me cut my hair tonight no why not",

this morning these things are so expensive right we got the goods another extremely pleasant experience at the apple store it really is like the greatest customer service truck is that we it's the greatest retail experience in all of retail certain name ever wait that's where we are right now hidden valley family farm what town is this that portola menlo Ehlert's is something not sure where we are geographically but it seems like a really appropriate place so why not all right okie dokie welcome to this week's Q&A i am here somewhere in Northern California about 40 minutes outside of San Francisco this week's theme is about entrepreneurship ready for business that seems appropriate ok he has had to say grant asks what is the absolute worst part about being an entrepreneur this is a little double sided because the worst part is also the most exciting part which is absolute uncertainty there are 0 guarantees there are no promises and that is a terrifying prospect max asks how do you ever thought one day you arrived where you are now that's a great question the answer is I know I never thought I'd literally be where I am right now in my career that I knew a couple things even when I was really young and really poor doing really horrible jobs for a living and that was that I would be working for myself and I would be doing something that was my own creation so something that i was personally passionate about because it's a product of my own my own brain versus working for someone else or in someone else's operation I just wasn't sure exactly how would manifest I don't know that anyone can protect that John asks do you have any previous business entrepreneurship ideas before being the last job I had I was 20 years old when I work for someone else so I do working for myself in businesses that were mine for the last you know 14 years it's just there were a lot less structure than being being is a is a very typical startup U idea team raise money build a company launched the company and the other versions of my career's of my companies were very different you know last thing I was doing prior to beam was like advertising was branded content youtube and that was a much less structured company but it was certainly a company that took risk in all the factors that lead to entrepreneurship were enveloped in that company and everything I've done i started working for myself interesting says I don't have a question but I Love You Man hashtag no homo d interesting why the need for the no homo hashtag can't a man just love another man Scotty asks do you think there's still room on youtube for a career you think the market is saturated now no there's definitely space on youtube for a career I think people see youtube has a place that it's easier to succeed then maybe Hollywood or in television or other meat more mainstream media outlets the truth is it's not the access is easier it's hard to get an agent to move to Hollywood and do all that that doesn't guarantee success anyways you too busy to start an account but where you go from there is not any easier it is just as hard to be a youtube star as it is to be a movie star make no mistake it is extremely hard and extremely competitive on youtube that doesn't mean that there isn't a multitude of opportunities there I'm not gonna say you asking us to have a harsh answer why should I trust myself how do I know it's not a waste of time and money if you're asking yourself that then you shouldn't trust yourself and it is a waste of time and money you need an unbridled confidence to succeed as an entrepreneur Arthur asks best tip for young entrepreneurs never give up and that sounds like a platitude but I mean that because if you try and fail and try and fail then try and then film and try and then just keep doing that eventually you will succeed it takes the gumption to keep going that separates the winners from the losers it's like that poster there's a kitten hanging off a tree and it's like you haven't failed until you've given up that's true I'll end this on a personal question what's the biggest rescue take in and was it worth it in the end first I'll answer the question yes in the biggest risk probably for me was moving to New York City I was 19 or 20 years old I had no money I had no work experience I had no education I have no friends and no contact i know resources at a three month sublet and then I was homeless my only previous job was as a dishwasher and i moved to new york city to become a filmmaker and I did that with a two-year-old son it is one of the few times in my life or what I look back I have no include what I was thinking I just blindly did it it was a purely emotional decision there was no rational or logical reason to take a chance like that looking back it only inspires me and motivates me more to embrace risk that i yielded to logic then I don't know where I'd be but I wouldn't be where I am right now and I'm very very happy right now ok that's this week's Q&A thanks for joining me hey man I'm done filming the Q&A did you want to play in the playground where can we go we are driving home and I stopped up here because it's just so insanely beautiful there's the great Matt Hackett right there and I'm just shooting some time lapse is oops there's a cop there goes the police map so down there's a big sign that says road closed do not cross and we cross it to come up here but man I were invited to a sneak preview screening of the marshes tonight well that was unlike his plus one we're headed there now pretty psyched to see it all right these passes get us free everything in here and I don't know what to get all right since this is a pre-release movie screening I'm putting this camera way for anybody free stop saying i'm not on the screen I'll check back in after the movie we just left Mars where you think we're good yeah I give it a big fat thumbs up it was really it was super fun fuck follow me on being and and hurry because i'm going to die so being what I was trying to say is you should follow me because I just risked my life try and go get a shot for you so that you guys can follow me on being and then thunder and lightning and rain came and I just barely made it back to my car so can I get an A for effort and maybe a follow",

            "subtitles": "God yeah can you believe how fast as clouds are moving storms a brewin also i don't have any shoes on right now even though i'm running like 10 miles because i'm using my my shoes to hold the camera there windy phone kept blown over alright alright alright i might be smiling on the outside I'm crying on the inside it is 301 in the p.i spent the entire day wrestling to get this camera to work but look good though this is a 4k vlog today for a very special reason for k because yesterday's episode about the new DJ I Matic Pro drone was very popular but a lot of people had a lot of questions about the imagery that this thing yields versus the imagery that this thing yield so long story long I thought I'd shoot today in 4k that way i can put the 4k image from these suckers in there like in its raw pure State I just been looking at camera setup camera that's a canon 5d mark for and then I got this monitor down here to see all this monitors their microphones there however to get this thing to work if you're not John Olson just ignore this next part John how do you possibly shoot your daily videos in 4k everyday how is this not just a huge pain in the act of the number one piece of criticism i was getting yesterday automatic pro that's the tiny girl lets that's this guy was that the image seem soft oh yeah the image may have been soft because i had to adjust the resolution of it to match yesterday's episode which is why today's important by the way if you click the little car right there and they all way up here to 4k you can see this video and all its glory you're going to want to have a really good internet connection if you do that otherwise it's gonna like glitch and buffer and all that bullshit now before i take these drugs out for a side-by-side comparison i want to sort of get into my my entire thesis and understanding behind drone quality first since this is the underlying theme of why I'm going there in the first place okay I hear y-axis here the marker the tip just falls out of this marker and then look at my fingers your x-axis here this is convenience practicality of use penny asked super-convenient x-axis here is the quality of the image this is the best quality you could ever ask for their boat a toe now ideally what you're looking for in any piece of hardware is fertile in this sweet spot here that means both super convenient and very high quality for you longtime viewers of the blog remember to supply this right this is a parent drone it's closer to a toy than a drone pretty low quality image but really easy to keeping your backpack so this little drone is super convenient but very very low-quality DJI inspire maybe you've seen this thing before this monstrous drone that like has moving arms like a space alien my friend jesse has one so the quality is over here but it's not to be at all in fact it's acute pain you know that exists here which brings us to this thing the phantom 4 up until yesterday my favorite drug on the market convenient and very high quality right about here the quality is almost the pretty convenient and then comes the Matic Pro is not a qualitatively as the p4 i would say it's right here but it's convenient is up here the ideal piece of equipment lives here the reason why i love this thing is because it lives right here good enough quality and very convenient any day of the week i'll trade a tiny bit of quality to get the shot leaving for traffic on my skateboard looks like in for the better okay I'm down here under the Williamsburg Bridge to do a comprehensive analysis between the phantom 4 and the DJI Matic Pro I also brought the parent whatever plastic thrown just as a control study number one backpack sighs this is the DJI gained from for backpack as you can see it's a fairly large pack this big bag is necessary to carry the drone down here you got your controller propellers etc next up is the Matic Pro the Maverick fits in this lovely satchel i wish this satchel came in cheetah print or maybe a hot pink in this little satchel fit the controller and then the drone itself last compares the parrot drone not an official bag but the drone itself and then the propellers which I keep in this carrying case this thing is a pretty serious commitment this thing is worthless on the Waimea part of this video you could take this out of date you can take this to the roller skating rink you could take this to the dairy products for the travel with ok now the moment of truth i'm going to apply each of the three drones on the same route for a side-by-side comparison ok first not preventing for I really really wish I picked today that wasn't like a stormy like horrible kill force winds but already started this okay here we go another grow yeah this is the parent i'll just tell you right now i'm going to want a hundred percent lose this the window tickets gonna fly away yeah get them off god this thing is a nightmare it's like 10 feet of water lost connection which is what always happens and then it's just SAT there and then it flew back here and then it wouldn't land looking at the Phantom footage right next to the mattock footage the magic is a much softer make like less sharp unless it's a much softer image than the Phantom for the phantom 4 is a superior camera the gap is big but not overwhelming but it is a superior camera but when you're talking about the idea of either carrying this to capture that perfect image or carrying just this get an image that's good but not great for someone like me who a youtuber I make the video everyday convenience is a super huge priority so I'm going to stick with this but all of you commenters were totally right the natick does have a softer less sharp image then the big but if we're gonna forgive her back to wear today began i still think convenience over here is just as important as quality over here so i will trade this little bit of quality for this huge amount of convenience oh and the bebop drone this thing I just put that in there to show you what a drone of comparable size the natick actually looks like and the last thing to say is i wish i had a GoPro karma are so frustrating that i don't i would love to show you what that looks like because i don't have a GoPro karma yet they just lonely one for one day to give it back they do have this this is the session 5 in 4k the new session that's not out yet I kind of took it from him and didn't give it back but this is the exact camera that will be on the Karma to give you ideas like what the karma is going to look like that's a pretty good image here all pretend I'm a drone that's the best i could do that was shot on this little day for Kerry pretty pretty good pretty good GoPro okay i hope this was helpful just thinking I had three drones in my back and then i have this camera which is a 5d mark for its expensive there would be a terrible terrible day to get robbed unless you're the robber to be a great day to Rodney how's that doesn't happen",

explained why own right or at this out the friends in this ridiculous hotel driving around ridiculous cars let me get into it see a couple of years ago probably before you are a subscriber I did this super-fun project with mercedes-benz cool company great cars and I made a lot of friends with people at mercedes-benz while we did that project then a couple of weeks ago when i was at south by southwest I ran into Wolfgang who's one of those awesome people that work for mercedes-benz and he was like yo KC we're doing this huge press event in the south of france in April 14 for a new car it's not this car but I mean come on it's not the new mailbox but I mean come on this car and I was like bra love to but April 14 sew ins birthday and I'm spending it with my kid and he was like well does your kid love ridiculously fast luxury cars and yachts and helicopters if so bring them so yeah mercedes is doing like a press event mostly it's like magazines and regular press but they invited

so in the last week I really upset a lot of the viewers of this show for two before I get into that I work super super hard to mix up that I hope you love but I've upset you and I want to address it we are told I've upset you for two reasons the first was when i said the food here throughout is pretty much it it's British which is disgusting and it's pretty legit I was tired I was frustrated i was stuck in an airport all they had for breakfast were mushy peas and beans I didn't need to say all British food is disgusting I mean truthfully out like most foods I don't like French food I don't like escargot I really don't like American food especially American food that you get an airport that's disgusting then anyway people got really upset about that please don't be upset about that i really i only like pizza and candy real talk number two was when I what do you do have words your NYPD with the dignity members of the wealthiest car I've ever seen and look after like ten thousand people freaked out about that i went back and watch it and i get i totally understand why I out of context that looks really bad if you're in New York City most people are afraid of the cops they're scared to interact with them I think it's terrible i think tops feel like they're people just like you or me and if you saw me park that car in front of a fire hydrant so I could go to dollar pizza I would expect you to give me a hard time about it to you know it's not because of what you like to drive things like it's like a girl car I like his feelings were hurt he wasn't upset we're teaching about a car that wasn't his this wasn't a personal attack so i get it i totally understand why people got upset about that I should have been more considering the way portrayed it I never want to upset anyone see we all have our own moral compass that guides us through life that tells us what's right and what's wrong and what some people think is right other people think it's wrong or other people think and sometimes those things are misaligned in a million years I didn't think people get upset about me saying I don't like British food so i end this first segment of Real Talk I think I work really hard to like both not upset people and be true to like my own values even if that means that only mushy peas it's important for me to know that you know that i encourage you to continue to share your perspectives in the comments below only thing trying to establish who choose not to lose write a whole phone but what trying what's wrong real talk it is rare but I just got a call from Candace she said I left work early i'm at the park with the baby so it's 5pm going home to see my girls I've never been to a playground at this hour before it's packed here so play around rush hour I love you in and that is effective marketing who's this Elmo family trip to the grocery store love you we can't get married again Candice married guys maybe wanna take a time machine back three years ago I don't I don't know how realistic seven and pick a different outfit well you didn't like your wedding dress another successful family trip to the grocery store you I'm not really one to socialize but tonight i was invited to this event that Cadillac putting on this is not branded or anything like that yeah be really nice to come so I'm going out brother will be there for long you're like a Cadillac party right now look at this red carpet if you get Cadillac thing i'm laying our whole things over going on to spot a pop that's sort of a sudden I like your moves man I think what's up on cable yet no thank you yeah shop yeah man look at that thing yeah I don't know what this is it's really good awesome in here yeah I don't think it's supposed to be this slippery sounds like a workout in there I ran into a friend Nick and that's it for the Cadillac party he's not that short I was on my skateboard you skateboard have you ridden this thing and we got this Nick I believe in you to bring the ship anywhere today's episode was filmed at 60 frames per second that's why it's all smooth and weird-looking it was an experiment I love the look but it made everything had a dark and noisy like unclear though I'm gonna go back the way it was just let me know like do you hate the way I look today or do you like the way it looked today thank you",

            "subtitles": "Candace we're talking about moving apartments in New York City I mean we're not gonna I don't think because it's a stupid idea we just moved into this place but we will try to want to move apartments today on the blog something a little bit different than the law and we're going to do today we're going to do story time I do Q&A once a week I try to read the comments i try to pay attention to twitter and through all that I see trends trends and people asking the same question you're asking about the same thing kind of a lot so I just thought why not do a whole blog about one subject that particularly passionate about and that one subject is New York City see new york city has always been so much more to me than a place where I live this city has been my muse my inspiration the city has been I should really preface this entire story time story by saying if you're someone who identifies with a spirit of adventure or aspiration figure out how to live in new york city at least once in your life all right back to the store how many go all the way back here - 1988 when this movie the movie big starring tom hanks came out there somewhere between you and the trap going to do this the movie is about top and the movie is about tom hanks who magically becomes big he moves to New York City and he has the brain of like a twelve-year-old because he's a kid on the inside he succeeds widely beyond his expectations including getting like this ridiculous loft in the neighborhood that i live in right now and putting a trampoline and like skateboard and a basketball hoop inside his apartment it really captured my imagination because I was his age before he got big in that movie and I obsessed i was obsessed with new york city so this idea that I could move the city and be a kid and thrive here was like the most fantastical fantasy I could ever have when your kid when I was a kid hey you're constantly like dreaming you're fantasizing you're making yourself all these promises all these things you want to do when you grow up you can't do much as a kid you're just a kid I always dealt with this overwhelming feeling of helplessness I wanted to do things but I couldn't because I was a kid and that Tom Hanks movie for me really embodied the realization of all those promises he was like this guy moved to New York City and he like had the big apartment in the hot girlfriend traveling is lost and he got like by being a kid by doing the things you want to do as a kid my life's mission is and has always been to realize all the promises I made to myself as a kid and look when i was a kid I was always in trouble as always being told i was wrong as always being told I was stupid I was always being told don't do that so I crude a lot of promises i was in this permanent state of fantasizing like what when I grow up I'm gonna and New York City was so wrapped up it was so enveloped in all of those fantasies when I went from me kid who was twelve to being a teenager who was 16 I went from being like this maniac dream of a kid to being this like bona fide loser of a teenager who worked in a restaurant and had a pregnant girlfriend and had dropped out of high school so the idea of moving to new york city seemed really far away then that's me that's the trailer i lived in that was baby oh and kisses me in the newspaper when I was skateboarding by known stroller living in that trailer park living in southeastern Connecticut I just like I didn't fit in I felt like a jerk every day of my life and I did at this like nonsense of a plan to move to New York City to realize that i always keep it just far enough off to where it couldn't be a reality couldn't be tangible I think like my plan was actually in five years I want to be living in New York City and then when my baby mama dumped me I was like get I'm doing it right now this is the answer that question that i get a lot which is how do i moved to new york city or what's it like to move to New York City this is New York City this is a wall this is you me and everyone else who's ever want to live in New York City now to get from here to here you have to go over this wall and to get over this wall to do with this journey takes everything you got everything you've ever done in life everything you've ever earned in life all the resources you have have been used up getting over this wall just to get into the city and then you're here you're left in the city and you have nothing you start at the very very bottom and you slowly start this climb again this time the ascent is in New York City the hardest place to possibly survive till the live here to be able to move here make no mistake it is war that's why people say things like this city will eat you alive this city will literally eat you alive my first apartment was a closet so small that a futon that couldn't fold out bed to sleep on the futon in the couch shape because it wouldn't hold out it was so small my second apartment was blown up on sep tember 11 my third apartment was a hardwood floor in my brother's apartment my fourth apartment had a shared bathroom down the hall to share with a bunch of the legal immigrants and people who had just gotten out of prison that was the first like two years of my life and city but that was the price of entry that's what it costs to be here and what did being here mean it was it is it forever will be for me the promised land like for the first time in my life I was at a place where I fit in the first time in my life I wasn't surrounded by people who are telling us doing things wrong I could do whatever I wanted to do whenever I wanted to do it and I was surrounded by really smart people that encouraged me to do that that's what new york city was for me it's as if you went around the world and found all the people that didn't fit in everywhere else and plop them all on an island and that island is called Manhattan and now at age 34 we took me like a decade and a half to figure it out but now I am Tom Hanks in the movie big this fun house this is my office like I do this the list that is this gets a little bit shorter every single day and it was enabled first and foremost by living in this city thats it for todays vlog i hope you enjoyed story time yeah ok sometime right drink could I have a milk something got a car outside you want to get out here uh-huh",

it's like your mom your dad or your kids or your girlfriend or boyfriend or your wife or you're just somebody you love and then just just picture yourself holding them into it hang on to that thought while I play this music for like 10 seconds the father he is the brother canoodle atyani lead on a girl dead of a build lv a doggie whoo doggie campagna find find more of those moments hang on to them did you bring yeah it yeah you got me there got me there look at the size of this thing today in the crazy world of weird that people have sent me the world's largest gummy bear because 51 servings a hundred and twenty calories so 15 this is 6,000 calories right here thanks Alex I don't know what to do with this did you see the video online with a guy I made this for me I made one for you I do like machine this mini tripod out of aluminum I made this by hand brilliant couple days ago I showed my new office space and I explained my big ambitions for that I want to like hire people and now I did not say in that video that I wanted people to be sending your resumes more than I was actively hiring anyone but i got like 500 no joke 500 emails from people asking me about you know working with Mimi hiring them this segment is going to be called yo let me get a job i would say most that's like eighty percent literally eighty percent of the people who sent me the resume did one thing and that one thing is completely wrong and i want to explain it to you because if you're ever applying for a job don't ever do this all their emails all their cover letters that was started by saying something akin to dear Casey I want to work for you so i can fulfill my dream of casey i want to work with you because I want to learn work for you because I wanted to take me to the next place because i want to fulfill my goal of all right all of that is wonderful and I mean it when I say it's tremendously flattering for me to hear I've built to run like 45 companies in my life I've been hiring people for 10 years and one thing that's never really compelling is dwelling on what I can do as your employer for you and it's because the employer is hiring you the employer is paying you to do a service instead of talking about how it's going to benefit you you should always focus on what you're going to do to benefit the company meanie I find it much more interesting when a cover letter says here's what I can do for you I can build things I'm good at editing video I don't mind working long hours I'm driven I'm focused here all the things that I can do to better your operation when I was younger applying for jobs that is all I focused on was how I would be an asset to whomever was considering hiring me all i have to say here lower your expectations this is not a mini tries phantom for this is a tiny baby toy drone look how little it is tiny look how small it is compared to my hand it doesn't have a camera that i thought i could attach one to it all right it's on little lights push it you want to fly I don't act number cool guys got still do every day I let some stranger fly and now it's in a tree oh no I can see it oh boy it's okay that could be it haha chi I don't know what I'm was a

good I have to dive into it next plane ok sorry about this i try not to get distracted when i get distracted this is too good of a question we did not properly answer bear with me here okay yeah your x axis here got your y-axis here these are the jobs you have in life and here on your y-axis you got your skills your education your experience your value and then this this is you is your first job maybe at McDonald's maybe it's a burger king maybe you're washing dishes but you do gain skills education experience your value increases now the minute you're no longer going up the minute your trajectory starts to plateau you have to move on to job number two and job number two should increase your value when you expired this job you find job number three the moment you stop going up and you start to go like this in any one job in this gap gets big here that's when it's time to change things this plateau which is comfort when you're doing the same thing day in and out of your job is when your value starts to atrophy if it's not going up it's actually going down because the rest of the world just keeps moving this is the only trajectory to do in any career now this doesn't mean you have to be quitting your job every six months that doesn't mean anything like that but at your job you should always be asking yourself am i learning new things and I increasing my value if the answer is no work harder and find that opportunity or maybe find a new job so Jack's a really good example of this yet he's doing me for a long time but he's never moved laterally his value is always doing up this is true for every job I've ever had when I was washing dishes i was learning how to cook and before i left that job in the restaurant I was a line cook I wasn't just a dishwasher every job I've had in my entire career as like an orange and the minute there's no more juice to be squeezed from that orange I let it go and move on lens dirty all that rain and snow use lens caps that's better yeah what's your best piece of advice for keeping yourself motivated on those days when you can't even wow I don't really believe in that crap you know it's like to sit around and say i'm not motivated so I can't do anything to meet it's the same thing is sitting around me like I'm so hungry I can't eat the only way you're going to alleviate your hungers eat some food the only way to fix your motivation problem is to do something thanks for question own this company sent me these cigarettes that art cigarettes to help you quit smoking I don't smoke and I don't need to quit smoking but thank you all find somebody to give those two cases somebody who takes a lot of trips and talks a lot of people are you ever afraid of finding a state of repetitiveness or if you confident in your ability no I don't feel confident that i repeat myself every week when I do these q and A's definitely feel repetitive and a lot of the stuff that I do but but blocking has taught me that like life is nothing but like a series of actions over and over and over and over so if the idea of this blog weblog in general is to share my life with you then there's going to be repetition in there so I don't feel insecure about it but I Chris this is very repetitive moon case I'm working at a don't have flash frozen over chop I wanted to ask you what's your favorite okay i have a dentist appointment in an hour and 20 minutes from eating so much handy my favorite candy is probably Reese's peanut butter cups I've never been super fond of drugs not a big drinker I don't party much I have like no addictions in life but candy ok last question Scotty asks are you going to VidCon this summer Scotty yes I am the question is are you coming to the time you know I have to say big time for the uninitiated is like a gigantic get together of all the youtubers and everything else you said I was very skeptical of the time last year like I really wasn't sure what to expect but I was so blown away by what an amazing event it was I cannot wait to go back this summer like I want to do something amazing they're not just like I meet up or mean green I want to do something really incredible what should it be thank you love Riley Thank You Riley for this lovely letter and whatever's in this lovely little package thanks Riley your Casey I like your videos in the style of your blogs best of luck olay I like thank you for all this candy if I wasn't going to dentist this afternoon my plan B no sugar has been going so I totally fell off the wagon yesterday and ate so much candy but besides that I'm like eight days no candy -

manhattan right yeah yeah yeah it is 1pm right now I haven't left the house since i got back here at like eight this morning it's been great spent the morning with Francine and I actually slept a couple of hours slept not on an airplane for a couple of hours hangout with Candis she's great just lovely morning did I miss this see i missed this skyline I missed my skateboard i missed the smell there's no late night movie there's no priests like there's no place like home and this my juice remember my just thank you love this juice I've been missed my commute to work every day i love this commute I actually miss this studio you know making videos and running this operation and everything i do all of that infrastructure is built around this physical space and being away from it makes it all really hard working from an airplane seat is not as glamorous as it may seem just tearing through some of the packages i got while I was away got some great stuff like Matthew Santoro his new book Thank You Matthew site to dive into this thing and that I got some curious things one in particular rogaine hair regrowth treatment hair loss is real and it's something that affects a lot of people around the world now me so far in life i have not been affected look at the strength of this hairline I'm 35 years old there isn't even any signs of even the most nothing look at this look at the thickness of this hip I got a lot of problems in life but hair loss is not one of them I need my grandfather died with a full head I could be one of those circus freaks that dances from there it's so thick you could knit a sweater with my hair so thanks for the gesture I don't I I don't know what to do with this if you'd like a three month supply of rogaine just let me know in the comments below and i will have dylan email you send it to you or something now without a doubt the hardest part of me having been away for the last couple weeks was being away from my family but in a very very close second place for the hardest thing about being away from last week's was knowing that these two guys right year we're sitting in the office now few months ago you might remember i had a very early boosted board version to prototype here in the studio that was not that was not a working like fully functional prototype that was just me me like harassing boosted being like send me anything i just want to check it out and they were super cool and they sent me that is crazy bright and they sent me that one with a disclaimer that like Casey this is not a finished product ok this this is a finished product up I have been waiting so long for this and I was especially heartbroken after losing my boosted boards in Colorado that look better hotel or exposed and man oh man I love to have one of these bastards while while i was in South America 40 boosted me likey are boosted board version 2 as abusive work better and there's one thing I know and that is that the only thing better than a brand-new version to boosted board is two brand-new version to boosted boards don't really need two of these things probably not to get overexcited and get two of these yeah any regrets none what so i boosted what is what is that was was loaded mean alright boosted five ready to be christened very very minor change of plans actually take the unmarked boosted six here instead of boosted five because the paint doesn't seem to want to dry and I like got all of my clothes in my hands I'm just gonna take the new new one that having pornero on yet i always say that i'm going to do a comprehensive review of things and then I never do but this is going to be different besides my camera I don't know of a gadget i have in my life that I take more damage up in my electric skateboard alright it's faster it grips the road better it's like it's like sticks to the ground and I know they said something about improved trucks and improve wheels but like you can really feel the difference it's like it like quarters like a lambo all right the rest the review is going to be to be continued remember book hi remember before when I said that my family was my number one in the spoofs it borders number two i promised candace i'd be home by six so we can do something tonight it's 603 so i just got home and nobody's here but check this out remember when Francine did that modeling for Juicy Couture it's her modeling photo all gigantic and frame like really you're good man for sending this over to find girls that they were in the pharmacy yeah she made it to find a friend seen this is uncharted territory for you that in mind that ladder give her some space and baby sleep Candace's asleep you know all this awesome traveling and only exploring everything I get to do it's amazing and I'm thankful and I'm happy everyday at the opportunity to do these things but at the end of all of it i don't think there's anything that makes me happier and feel more fulfilled than being home with the family sorry guys I don't mess up your wedding maybe sneak through their congratulations",

            "subtitles": "he was a terrific guy exactly the person you thought he was mmm yeah feel selfish hello and welcome to this very special edition episode of the block we are about one month away from the four-year anniversary of Hurricane sandy the worst hurricane to hit New York City and today's episode gonna be about my experience during that night where I show all this produces I've never really shown before of lower Manhattan New York City completely underwater a little refresher october twenty night 2012 hurricane sandy hit New York City now this was the second costliest hurricane in US history never left a path of destruction all the way up the East Coast but on the twenty-ninth hit New York City now I was here at the time I lived in these village and we knew his stomach the forecast for a large and dangerous storm surge is the same as it was this morning and they'll warn the whole city they prepared us for absolute apocalypse and then like nothing happened tell me what you really think all right tell me think about this storms all right because our tickets right there was rain and a little bit of wind but this is New York City like we can handle it then towards the end of the day I was riding my bike back downtown on the west side highway and i watch the river just keep going up and up and up and up ultimately getting towards the southern tip of the island and I remember this detail vividly the southern tip the island means like it's where you can see all the water and the Statue of Liberty so it's where all the news crews were set up with their big lights and their cameras and there's this one . when the water came up over the side box that i watched all the news crews pack up their stuff pack up their van shut down their lights for the cameras an event in takeoff and they were all saying it's not safe to be down here it definitely was not safe to be down there but this is a slightly younger slightly stoopid version of me was also with my younger brother who had just gotten out of the military who convinced me that is like superior military survival training would keep us safe and then my equally reckless hockey player friend sean avery was with that lots of watches and at that point as the cameras abandoned southern Manhattan we don't fit now when I say we do then I don't mean that as a figure of speech i mean that well almost literally the water started coming up faster than we could have ever imagined definitely one of those situations where people use words like Serge you know what does that mean in a few minutes later the water is an entire foot now the middle of the city was higher ground and it wasn't wet but the edges the edges were closest to the water that's where on bikes there was a moment when we saw a guy a delivery driver and his car was stuck whatever do that was the only that was the only touching moment of the night mmm you can leave him this was like a fancy bank building and you can see the atms right there and you can also see the people who work in that building at the top of the escalator now i have reviewed this for dinner while but can you imagine being trapped in that building in seeing three guys on bikes in waist-deep water come up the window yeah this is South Street Seaport this is where there are a lot of tall buildings banks things like that this is the most shocking part of the night the water was literally at times chest-deep like this and there were no emergency personnel anywhere no cops no firemen there was there nothing powered out in parts of the city we could see the fire engines alt but we were also very very alone this is the West Side Highway this is an eight-lane Highway it was completely under water from one side to the other yeah remember we got this fancier neighborhood in lower Manhattan and there was a car under water there are a lot of cars under water but there was one car underwater with flashing headlights it was a Bentley this is like a couple hundred thousand dollar car and somebody had left it out and it was submerged underwater well yeah who has a bentley and leaves it out in one of the worst hurricanes in new york city's history yeah yeah good luck all right around midnight I said goodbye my little brother I said your body Sean and my plan was to come here to the studio and edit this video like it was yesterday I remember riding my bike down Broadway one of the busiest streets in new york city in all the power on the west side of the street was out one side of the street pitch-black the other side was still lit the other side stored power and that's where my office was a couple blocks from my office on my bike and all the sudden like all the lights on this side of the street went out in that same moment for the first time ever my phone got the emergency alert and i traveled to read it said get indoors in that moment for me was sheer terror it was dead silent it was pitch-black I was completely alone in this city I've never felt so vulnerable is weird because the first time ever including up until now first time ever i've been completely alone in New York City in the absolute darkness by flashlight was the only source of light that was a moment of absolute terror for me cannons that were married yet but I said on the mission to go find her and on my way to her apartment i saw a large group of people gathered around this building I wouldn't check it out the entire facade the entire front of this building had collapsed that was my last experience of the night that's what i said this I was found Candice and sort of hung up my camera for the night if there's an epilogue this movie would be that I was in fact the only one to get that footage and because of that there are a lot of companies that wanted it so i ended up licensing the footage to HBO weather channel national Geographics all the news people and I took all that money from licensing this footage and we bought clothes and supplies and I've been donated them to the victims of the hurricane ok this concludes today's special presentation i hope you enjoyed it yeah",

Bourne movie this is like a nine-minute vlog that's done 10 million views that's insane okay in any event why am i bringing this up because there's one article here its input it's a publication called the gothamist which is like a big New York City blog right here's here's the part that I like it says recently professional fun hammer Casey nice tat professional fund our greatest title ever Casey nice that and then here's the part that makes me look AKA real-life pucci now look I make a living by sharing my life in the form of videos on the internet being called names is not something that is new to me but I've never been called pucci so I look up what Pucci is I think he needs a little more oh yeah there it is right there i am the real life pucci hold on ready somebody I don't always wear a backwards hat i just have really curly hair and if i take a shower like I do in the airplane and where it hadn't started doing something that's like a little bit stupid and a lot a bit risky it goes it goes like this ready take my boosted board and then i take this bike lock wrapped around the pole and then lock it through my truck just like that so it's locked the trucks there and then this is locked here and then just sort of leaning up against like that it's risky and stupid because that's really expensive in this isn't super safe but for like five minutes you so much easier than carrying a heavy heavy boosted were around a lot to all your videos you do a great job is to take one I thought I should be about your video you don't breach of you see my wife in here you see my wife teachers at school said Francine moms playing with water but they need more shirts for her this is where can despise baby shirt just fine we have like a photo shoot with the cousins this is all you I don't know any keep up the good work and like watch all your videos through here alright I'll see you around look up look it's still there it held where the coca-cola dress choose me and then and then I'll go back to the office but you don't like these faxes don't have the ones that I want my size I like these but they don't they don't have min 11 that's good right Bhayani you enter i try i don't always succeed but I try like take a half an hour out of every day to spend with a girl like out of the office doing something try to keep that relationship keep that marriage on the level you know yeah this is my main camera great camera mmm good camera its weakest link is this right here this mini jack always fries in fact i have to show you i'ma show you what i have i have one two three four and five oh ok for and all of these have the same issue microphone jack broken i think there is a very good argument there to say it's completely my fault that the microphone jacks broken because I half the time I put the camera down put it down like this not cool this little clip here is meant for attaching a camera strap but i think i think that i can use that to attach a piece of wood and make like a protector for this the Japanese pole saws more precise of a tool than this you see the trouble is after navigate around all the precision movement and it can't get in the way the screens ability to pivot so it's like a very specific size piece of wood here this fit is absolutely magical trying it handled a lot so gonna definitely want soft edges on this no do it we do out there man is that you're vlogging camera wireless well what is that this is a red it's just like your camera to shoot a little bigger to look at your food thank you sir i love this building just all people making stuff alright this is the this is the sketchy part given this a lot of thought and I really think drilling into this camera would be a bad idea so I'm going to glue it thermal adhesive hot glue the only one that it's pretty forgiving one time i use an image similar to this is my thumbnail and everybody thought I was like smoking crack or something get in that crack get about four seconds before this fully cure so okay thus concludes the arts and crafts portion of today's episode it never touches the cable i'm going home we're putting the baby in the stroller and we're taking her for a walk is tonight as well tonight's special good job Francine yeah you're the best scooter please job Candice you know the reason why we had to come out tonight is the last day of summer officially officially for me you know if you go back 365 episodes that you'll find me saying this one year ago today but for me the ear always ends when the summer ends at the time do you want to get the most bummed out and weird existential your night but it's also when we get the prettiest sunsets I get a lot of these requests it's impossible for me to address all of them because they've got a friend who watches your episodes religiously he's a marine in the US Marine Corps and was just promoted to Colonel so I just want to acknowledge and congratulate you Colonel Dan wisten wisten started on how to pronounce your name from Asheville North Carolina congratulations on the promotion it's a very big deal and thank you for your service",

concerned that they're going to like yank out half of my teeth and then i won't be able to speak for the rest of the day so I'm doing it right now live on please for the rest of your life what would it be and why that's a very question because I honestly do not have an answer I know it's a bit of a top out is called Q&A not Q and na so much of my life in ambitions and dreams and goals have always included me moving always being on the go I think life is like it's like a book and you have these chapters in your book and for me a really nice like bookend to those chapters is where I'm living so the idea of staying still forever is absolutely terrifying for me taste each and he decided to come to Australia you know consider a problem this world like a dozen times over and I've been to places like Afghanistan and just some weird weird sub-saharan like desolate locations and all over the middle I've never been on the continent of australia so the short answer is yes I really want to go I

Sam I just want to put you in the vlogs you sent me a video hey kasey kid like you ever seen line what is up with this auto focus like literally music will bring me to tears like there are songs about here that just bring you back to being a kid music affects me tremendously I listen to music all the time I'm not like a big music head if you ask me to name my 10 favorite artists i probably couldn't have been like two concerts in my entire life i will say that r kelly's i believe i can fly is an incredible song that if you just put your headphones on and listen to and really get into is absolutely magical yeah you just have to like let go of all of the goofiness that is associated with that song i believe i can fly hey Casey just want to know how long to take the design and do it to be mad how long to take the design and build beam you know like from nothing to the beta version that we launched with in July took about a year you never finished designing your building a technology product or a piece of software it's like fashion it's never done it's just always changing always evolving to adapt to people's needs and things like that terrific at the equivalent of filmmaking or editing process book when making your folks the short answer is no never on the blogs I have in films past i still have movies that I haven't finished i started years ago this blog has been like exlax for my brain when it comes to writers block conflict with time and shutdown games and jacket down and for those of you don't speak British this young lady named Mel just ask me how do you get past people trying to drag you down and mess with your dreams and stuff people who have given up on their own personal dreams and aspirations have a tendency to try to convince you and discourage you from pursuing your dreams and aspirations so getting past that for me was just like a confidence for arrogance that you have to find that says I'm right I trust my instincts more than I do these external forces other people that are trying to push me down that's a more didactic way of saying like you just have to believe in yourself and that sounds cheesy but that's the truth because if you believe in yourself like who gives a shit what anybody says or tries to do they're wrong you're right now go get them sorry I just wish you can I guess how do you get subscribers for you to channel that is a million-dollar question what is your name Italian man I mean how do you get subscribers man that's a stumper for me it's easier to get subscribers once you've picked up a little that's not even nice to say i don't know the answer to that question and I'm really sorry that I don't know the answer to that question ok video is really fun thank you guys for your questions work you next week time to go to the dentist right now you're probably asking hey why is there no audio with this I can hear it Casey say yeah I'm asking myself the same question why isn't there a microphone that's one hundred percent reliable all the time I really like rode microphones I don't mean to throw them under the bus i'm sure this is my fault but still all this is like a really funny scene i want the dentist it was terrible I saw Candice there that was lovely she was all funny and Goofy about a bunch of stuff you guys are always like an ass ever smile she's never happy look how happy she is and she was saying fun stuff but you'll never know she was saying fun stuff because that used to be a microphone and it failed me sorry the end of this log sucked hi I'm Hillary and I'm gonna be mom but what

have no idea how he's able to put these up in New York for me think are after after that oh I went to the magazine store which is really exciting i did something that I've always wanted to do i bought a copy of Playboy magazine look see page 27 that's me it was so much more excited about the first time I saw it in the magazine store on the footage that I deleted it that was the magazine store and there was this really funny interaction I had with the guys in there because i was so excited to buy a copy of Playboy and I think they thought I was like a little bit so pumped on it and then i showed them that I was in it and make that he's got so excited it's not the same i'm trying to relive it back on the bike they do it all right Online Film you see it dropped the can what is this I gotta go pick up the garbage but then the garbage take care all right we'll running running running into that guy was not what i did that didn't happen before higher level we're outside did you know

but you missed a great conversation this place right here I'm not going back inside want to explain the joke deleted all my footage from earlier just embarrassing i'm having like a little bit of an existential like crisis in my head crisis is extreme but I had a great day like I really had a great day but I don't have the record of that great day so does that make my day not great no it was a great day i had a great day and if this episode of my show has to suffer but i had the great day doesn't mean I didn't have a great day so I'll always take having a great day in real life over being able to make a great episode that shows what would have been I hope that makes sense I feel like I was under appreciating what was just a great day it was a great day no matter what in other more pleasant news the winner of the last room was pick his name is Bobby Wahl check out this photo of them I don't know what to these people is Bobby wash the body wash you are the proud owner of a new drone this is kind of like good news is good news for Bobby Walsh it's bad news for the other four hundred and thirty-four thousand five hundred and fifty people who tried to get the drone the heavy throughout the day but he's 27 who is it like that yeah i remember when i first learned final cut pro i spent like 12 hours straight editing a sequence and learning the program as i went and then write the end this is back in like nineteen ninety nine or something it was like you want to save I just click no and this weird instinctive well hit my entire project is destroyed but then had to do

you the audience k see how do you tell if someone likes you ah and related you know what I have no like and these years an adult when I was in Middle School I had no idea I thought Melissa like me she didn't like me but how do you get back into the dating game after being single for a very long time there's a monologue in the movie swingers that really nailed that she might the only difference between giving up and not giving up is if you take her back when she wants to come back how do you in Kansas keep the spark Corey for so long well basically kids and I are always on the precipice of like divorce and just like each other and chopping each other up into tiny parts and throw it in the ocean so that keeps it excited I'm a big believer opposites attract and Candice that are like nothing alike and that keeps things exciting most of the relationships that I've had that haven't worked out have been because of boredom so if you're with someone and it's easy to keep it exciting that person is probably a winner my dad asked me not to date until I'm 16 what's your stance on this I got a girl pregnant when I was 16 I was a dad by 17 i highly suggest not dating as long as possible how to do in Kansas end up together after everything is you know can decide when i get back together and break up when we break up and be like years when we were together we fight we be like you suck I can do better than you you don't make me happy you're the source of the problem and then we would start seeing other people will be like this sucks i miss Candace and then ultimately were like no no I'm the problem let me work on me and that brought us back together it's still not perfect but it's as good as I've ever had it why get married you know I never believed in marriage like the longest time I was anti-marriage but if it's important to your significant other you have to give that them and what marriage represents it's a way of saying like I'm completely committed to you just the record like I don't believe in any of the societal or like political aspects of marriage I think it's a way of showing commitment and and that's it then she asks my girlfriend broke up with me how do i make it not awkward when I see her every day in class ng it's gonna be awkward every day when you see you're in class there's nothing you can do how long after meeting canvas did you know she was the one like literally a month after our first day we got married and then we had to have an old at all others but we really liked each other right from the first time we met I don't know what that means but yeah I totally totally real you in my experience there's only one infallible way to get a girl to like you and that's make her laugh that's the best advice I can get em I love with work i'm completely in love with work I love work so much i love work because work always loved me back the more i love work the more it loves me back the more I give to it then work is my relationship with work is a perfect relationship I wish my relationship with my wife was a half as good as my relationship all right that's the last question now i'm going to explain why I'm down here there used to be these houses on this cliff here and I saw the news that the water was coming up is eroding the cliff so much that the houses were literally falling off the clip a neighborhood hanging on the edge as a powerful el nino eats away the coastline and may take homes with it look at that people live there and there used to be houses here yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah in fear there used to be another set of building those the ones that were falling into the water yeah these one dark crazy clothes yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I due respect why someone would want to live here though is amazing looking offer clip over the ocean yeah that's one of those things that are remember seeing and thinking I would love to see what that looks like in real life almost back in the city there it is that was a really long day yeah wow it's exactly like that aerosmith song yeah",

either a genius or idiotic so I still run every morning I've just run run out of interesting ways to videotape my same run on the same route every day so that's why these runs have not been appearing in this blog this guy right here that's Peter Dinklage from Game of Thrones ladies and this girl right here is Lindsay my running partner oh yeah huh let's go north to the fleet week you can see the boats but let's see the boat to take on the website i want yeah yeah have you ever seen an armored personnel carrier on the west side highway thank god no so excited ok keep running yeah just take a quick pause one of my favorite triathlons in New York City triathlon but it's a race i will never do again because it requires you to swim in the Hudson River beautiful river and that's the water let's live until next time away from home but 11.7 miles at a 750 pace and they had to hang out Lindsay a strong run today you're about to see some skateboard footage that was not shot on this thing this is the stabilizer i use the other day so expect shaky rocky normal-looking skateboard footage yeah you might remember this place from the mothers day blog you will thank you for my balloon this is my favorite store in new york city by the way was that good okay i won't edit that out i promise i was in the last time and we're in the last of these are what i needed got the balloons now I need cigarettes kind of a pack of parliament cigarettes please but i right it's gonna make me throw up that's why I wanted to help I mean I could all smoke a little bit but not a lot it's really bad so what I'm trying to do is I want to fill up balloons with smoke and I tried to find like a turkey baster to suck the smoke out and then pump it in there is nothing you would turkey mr. so we have to smoke suck the smoke out of cigarettes and blow up three balloons is not a lot of the small balloon all right we've got our three darts ready we've got the camera set up behind us now it's time to smoke some cigarettes kids don't smoke also don't try this at home also just don't smoke in general don't smoke cigarettes don't ever smoke cigarettes well we'll fill one up a little bit and then let it to the small galaxy ok ok let's see let it out for the camera so that's pretty smoky it's pretty smoky oh oh well i would definitely go throw up so we're into my lungs do you see any smoke it's pretty smoky to pop the balloons why not just use the propane torch it should work all right look for lip business let's talk okay hopefully some lingers I'm not sure that's going to work that did succeed in making both jacking me sick but i guess here goes the new intro roll it so let's talk business my plan and starting this blog was to spend a lot of time talking about my yet undisclosed new business i know i've been super cagey about it and they're also like real kind of mechanical considerations like legal stuff and the patent applications causing filed so I still can't show you literally what we're making and I don't want this blog to become like me teasing about this thing that I'm making about this new company that is my whole life and not saying what it is so I want to like restructure this segment and I want to get into like a little bit of the history a little bit of the last 18 months almost that have been entirely devoted to building this business and explain some of that with you because that is something that I can't really talk about ok so i want to go all the way back to the very very beginning where I decided to start a new business and the first thing I had to learn was how to start a new business I'm running biking and squared out so i think this story will be more compelling if I tell it in the location where it took place either March or februari of 2014 this is like a year plus ago I've been sitting on this idea for a really long time and I hate sitting ideas I think ideas you either act on where you set them free you don't dwell on an idea or it will go rotten really quickly and I've been dwelling on this idea for a really long time I ask someone that I really look up to and someone that I consider a mentor person in particular someone I admired every capacity he's an incredible father an amazing friend a wonderful human being in a brilliant brilliant businessman anyways I asked him for some of his time and we met for lunch we met in a restaurant this was the actual restaurant right here about coffee shop and this was the actual table we're sitting out here I told him about this idea this this thing that had been sitting with me for a while and he said is this a project or is this a company and I said this is a company and he said okay you're gonna need money I was like writing down like everything he said and he said write down the names of every person you can think of that you could ask for money and then put a number next to their name for how much you think you could ask them for and that's like that's a that's a crazy idea that's something I've never I'm not big on asking anyone for anything but I followed his advice and i did that i wrote down all the names i have my own dreams in life and I have my own list of things that I hope to accomplish before i die but write that in there I i showed him the the names of people that I wanted to ask for money and he looked and he said this is good and then he said I wanted to put me on that list to want to put me down for a hundred thousand dollars and that just like shook my world it's like it shook me to the core and right in that moment that feeling that he gave me of someone believing in me someone I admire so much believing in me on that level at that moment my new dream in life my new goal in life is to one day do for someone else what he did for me in that moment because what he did was he said I believe in you I want you to do this thing i want you to realize you're here this dream of yours and here i'm willing to back it up with a insane check and that was it that was how this company started and the weird thing about having someone step up for you for having someone believe in you like that is it really raises the stakes of failure it means to fail now means to let him down the flip side of that is it really it really pushes you to succeed alright i guess that's it now there are about a hundred of these stories between that day and where my company is now and I want to share them all in this blog and I want to do it as best I can without being super annoying because i won't have shared with you what this company is but I really think this is like the best the only way that I can start to really share some of the details of what it is I'm up to because I've said it before and I really mean it this company is my full life yeah yeah",

you what's up my cat like this morning and I think you're on the blog yeah yeah I've been a little overwhelmed with questions about being especially on Twitter I appreciate it feel free to keep them coming but I really have come to enjoy the dialogue that is this blog with you the viewers and I don't want to just be dominated by beam so let's make this Q&A about something else um first let me just get sort of the required apology for that terrible noise you're hearing in the background no just general New York City nonsense sorry for the noise ok back to unit David asks what's your favorite and least favorite part of your average day favorite part is waking up I love starting the day least favorite part is the battle between light - I leave work early so I can spend a little extra time with the family when i get my work done and the night to see my family less it's like a lose-lose have you ever collaborated with Candace on any work no i'd like to i just find it like workplace relationships is never a good idea I try to be supportive but actually like collaborating with her I think might be dangerous Rufus asks when did you stop smoking I you know I was never a huge smoker i spoke for like a couple years when I was like 22 23 running through an airport is fast they could catch my plane and like having trouble breathing and that's not like smoking is for idiots I'm done and I like I quit then in there and I've never smoked again so it is bad Gabby asks how do I realize what I want to do with my life I literally have no idea and 19 figuring out like your purpose or your passion or your mission in life is really really hard to do I've always said like you should either be realizing your dreams are figuring out what they are figuring out what they are is really hard the best advice I can give to how to figure it out is to keep very very busy and for some people that means going to college for some people that means getting a job for other people it can manifest itself in a million different ways but sitting around trying to figure it out will never yield results Danielle asks what do you think the first time you saw Candice Candice was such a baby when I met her and she was so out of my league so the first thing that I thought when I saw her was like I will stop at nothing to get this girl to like me it was like it was a hard-fought battle that one Michael asks favorite hobby running running is the one thing I love to do in my free time more than anything else Dexter asks why don't you bike anymore I live very close to the office walking is literally faster than having to lock my bike up that's all my mom wants to know your favorite place to travel and where you would go that you've never been a favorite place to travel unquestionably Cape Town South Africa that's canvases hometown it's where she was born she's so happy when she's there and it's also like this incredible place on the other side of the planet where would I go to haven't been yet I've never been to China love to go to China finally ultimate goal as I'd love to go to space which feels like it could happen in my lifetime what would you do if you woke up in the morning you realize that the last 10 years of your life was a dream i get to work Richard asks how does can't feel about you always being at work honestly it's one of the reasons why i love her so much and why our marriage is the success that it is so far as she's really understanding of my not just the fact that have to work a lot but the fact that like my work is who I am and if there is any threat to that that it would like be a threat to me as an entire person works not something I do work is literally the person is who i am it's my identity and she doesn't want to jeopardize that she's very supportive Candace is great rival asks do you love us us the subscribers love is a strong word i owe you guys the people that watch my blog and who have downloaded beam and the people that follow me on twitter I Oh like so much of my career is the fact that you've chosen to give your time to spend it with me and the stuff that I made I appreciate that on a level that is indescribable like without the audience for this blog and everywhere else that I wouldn't have a career so I appreciate that but I don't really know why I like some like social media kids and like longer say i love you the audience I love like six people on planet Earth two of them are my children so love is a strong word I'm gonna be really honest with you I wouldn't use the word love it's a deep appreciation for the fact that you're so generous with your time and that you're so honest with me and then you say nice things in the comments below it means so much but love tomorrow ok I gotta end this right now that's something i'd like to share with you so I have nearly every means of unnecessary motorized vehicular personal transport systems I have this busted a white hoverboard this fully functional black hoverboard this ridiculously fun one will hover board this self balancing motorized unicycle but but there's one means of unnecessary human to wherever I called it before that I don't have that I really want and that's changing today contained in this box is something I've literally wanted since I was a little little tiny boy what's already got their skateboard motorized skateboard ok I've got a lot of work to do today but yesterday I want the entire day without leaving the office literally and that's any different today so i get your check in with the team and then I'm going to take a quick motorized skateboard office break yeah baby what's up guys ok this is the inaugural ride on the boosted board I think I'm doing it right I did not read the instructions per usual ok it feels pretty good i feel like i must not have charged it because i think the battery's dead don't these things from charge us using this thing wrong this skateboard has an app that's ridiculous and it had was set to beginner mode I've now moved it into Pro Mode promos ok now she go 24 miles an hour instead of 11 well that's it ok starting to get the hang of it it's a little on the too fast side there's truthfully honestly absolutely no need for a staple for skateboard to go this fast it's literally faster than the speed limit in New York City allows yeah yeah yeah yeah Casey nice that you're like my hero oh my gosh I why this thing yes all right all right now i will see you in California safe flight don't work too late it is 11 13 in the PM i have a flight tomorrow morning at 7am so i have to be up at 5am and have impact himself the office",

trying to lean forward it goes for what we have available you sure you don't want to try it no I don't want to track man it's a lot of fun on the train is ready for you but you're very good at these things ring and it yeah you're good at it yeah what are you watching Candace the perfect watch your blog early meeting this morning with a designer we're working on like the icon and the branding around the new company which is super exciting and once we get to a place where like initial designs have been sussed out i'm definitely gonna have you guys the internet help me sort of finalize the design which would be awesome yeah he did you know trickling out no you just need my shot so much better means things are so dangerous they really should never you should never ridden outdoors today is a crazy full day in the office the company's coming along like we're getting closer to be able to talk about it and ultimately launching but he definitely highlights for me some larger concerns I have with my ability to keep making this blog every day and run my company but whatever today I want to tell another story because those are like the easiest for me to make and I think they're good but it's a lot easier than need like running around all day with a camera that actually work today I just love to this intro outside to like so it's not just me in my office talking I'm going to lunch with my crew and then tell a story about when it's okay to give up on a project that you've started here's a little teaser it's never okay having an all-team lunch right now the team is enormous I don't even know how we're going to fit into the same restaurant also I don't know where they are so good you'll find that are you doing hey what's up buddy what's up guys up with them case nice to meet you sometime or they don't look for him on what did any of you to deliver to your ground so now I'm really late to meet the team and I don't know where they are i think that went to the usual place and are probably sitting on the stoop but I don't know anybody get me lunch this feels like a summer camp so we kept lunch situation David how was lunch delicious that one actually I say that but it wasn't as good as yesterday to be honest like I think they need to work it was a special sandwich need to work on it a little bit you know that was hard to eat it was hard to park it was too much dressing there's overdrive yeah it was oiling but whatever you know I we got too much to let go I would want a for effort but they need to improve you just this little lip right here this this is so hard to get up I gotta fix that ok let's talk about when it's okay to give up and when to quit sometimes you go out and shoot all this stuff you have this great idea you come back to edit it and for whatever reason somewhere between beginning the process and finishing it you just throw in the towel it gets the best of us it's never okay there's never like a valid excuse not to finish something that said there are a number of projects that I've started and not finished for example there's this awesome movie here one moment please trying to finish my movie and cannons cameras have a really bad habit of just decided to stop recording it just gives you an error message that says movie stop recording i just lost like a whole bunch of footage that I thought I had shot can this get pretty mad at me when I smash things but ok let me get another camera and get back to my movie all right this this is the 5d mark III this is a much more expensive camera and fancy camera then the one that I just destroyed but watch is the reason why I destroyed my other camera and this is the reason why i'm about two seconds away from putting an axe through this camera see that it just does that no rhyme no reason it just does that i have d like highest speed memory card you can possibly look at the speed on that memory card it's the highest speed memory card you could possibly have in there there's no reason for this camera to be critically failing me like this but it is rather than scratching my acts up anymore by destroying this piece of crap i will just finish shooting this vlog on my point shoot sorry for the lower quality I'd also like to go on record by saying don't buy canon cameras because they will fail you when you need them it is brilliantly appropriate that i'm having this much trouble finishing this movie which is supposed to be about movies that I've had trouble finishing it's like that alright so back the real story this is like this really awesome movie that i started shooting in like two thousand eleven and two thousand eleven there was this crazy snow storm and we went out like filmed us like look this is just goofing around in the snow ready this is my friend ariel schulman over here see him and then I'm on top of the snow mountain in Times Square and he is like ready look at that so we went around during this snow day we shot this amazing snow day in New York City movie then to compliment this snow movie from four years ago last summer we went out and we shot the same movie like the same snowed a movie but we shot during like the hottest day of the year we went to Central Park and we were all sweaty and hot there's rel there there's Haley there's Louie who get started it with us and we like we shot the same movie the same scenes but we shot them when it was super hot out but this is me doing a backflip that there's Haley I love summer um okay if we just never finished that movie I don't know why just never finished it now that's like a silly easy movie to not have to finish on a much bigger level and this this is why i am making this video it's not because of the stupid snow day movie it's because for years ago now four years ago I went to Afghanistan I went there with one of my closest friends in the whole world a guy by the name of Scott Campbell Scott is a tattoo artist and he and I had this plan to to travel to Afghanistan this is the height of the war the height of the surge to embed ourselves some soldiers in the battlefield and then to just tattoo them and there's a million stories behind this about what it took to get into the country about like how scary it was about how you sneak body armor through dubai you can get it in Afghanistan the DoD won't let you in Afghanistan if you have your body armor and then kind of the best part of the whole story is that we succeeded we actually did it we embedded with special forces and we spent a week tattooing these guys there I'm in touch with them to this day I made the movie I made the movie several times i finished it several times i have a doc on my computer right here that's an hour long it's great and I've never released it and it's because i don't consider it done the case with this movie in particular is unique it's the fact that like these guys got hurt over there while we were there Jimmy one of the soldiers were shot in the head while we were there and i have a sense of obligation these guys to make this something that really captures who they are and what they're doing and I just don't have the confidence in any of my current edits that they do that and even right now i'm working with another editor friend of mine who I think is a much better storyteller than I am we're trying to make it the movie that it should be but this is something that keeps me up at night this is a project that I've never finished these are the guys be embedded with here they're arresting jumpers from Alaska Alaska - 12 that's Roger is that the guy who sort of in charge this here this is jimmy that band-aid on his head is shot in the head the day before this picture was taken this is my friend Scott Campbell that's me that's rods there and they just take this up in the helicopter on a mission that's Brandon they're goofing around that's got giving them tattoos this is funny this is aaron one of the pararescue jumpers and he wanted his tattoo on his butt and this is scott giving the tattoo on his butt you like some smoking in the needle in the ass over and over again and I kind of like it i would like to say that these guys the soldiers in the movies they do have it edited version of it that they watch that they love their thrilled with it I will finish this movie I will release it i'll probably put on this YouTube channel and honestly as silly as it sounds making this blog about it has sort of will help move that process for it i'm on my way home how does this picture quality look this is shot on a new camera I just picked up today",

here is punishable by like a hundred and fifty dollar fine which I agree with I'm already late gonna want to ride around the entire Park so just saw this at me I was like dude I got to talk to that guy and then here you are going to see your marriage ok maybe you've seen that crazy amazing series on HBO called the jinx this guy edited the whole thing he had a much bigger role than that but this is the genius behind that I think this is where I'm going I hope you're having a good day so far mine sucks I like didn't run this morning and got up early I mean I always get up early but I left the house early to race this event that I agreed to do and I got to it just now in the event is until tomorrow so there's nobody to blame for my so far he gay that doesn't make it anyway now i'm sure this wasn't done on purpose but I had an angle grinder right now I cut this bike in half this is my bike here this is some good bike and this gift that locked his lock through my brake cable so I can't get my bike free because this moron put his lock through my cable ah i'm going to undo my whole cable to free it without breaking the bike but like this is my brake cable here disconnected from the lever pull it out from the lock now i have to reconnect so far to have complained about screwing up my own schedule and complain about somebody locking my bike up I don't understand why people complain it only seems right for me to dedicate this entire blog to complaining that's begins the complaining blog let's chat a little about complainers generally a complaint as a person who doesn't take responsibility for their own action a complainer someone who would always talk about why they failed instead of how to succeed now there's one simple reason why it's never ever okay to complain and that is there's always someone that has it worse than you do let me give that a little context so when I think about some of the things in my life that I'd want to complain about some of the really hard things and then I give them any sort of real world context they aren't that consequential let me get really specific when I was 16 years old and I had to drop out of high school to get a terrible job to support my new baby that's pretty rough you know that is a big enough excuse for me to justify any actions I take in my life I know but I couldn't do this because to embrace that as an excuse to complain but the truth is that's not so bad dropping out of high school like really not having much better place to live having no money having a baby being on welfare like all those things really suck but in the grand scheme of humanity it's not that bad bear with me i turn on my computer I go to a new site and the first story I read is about migrants from me mr that are stuck on a boat stranded because the Thai government won't let them into port these are people just like you and me and they're literally starving to death and this is right now I don't mean to be so extreme but these are the things i remind myself of any time I want to complain or bitch about something in my life you realize that there are people just like you and me who at this very moment art truly facing things we are lucky enough to go our entire lives without ever having to experience ok let me tell you let me tell one more story to back this up one more story were like my feelings around complaining and life in general were really set straight three years ago I did this project led like a very small relief mission to the philippines after they had been devastated by Typhoon high on this is some of the video here that somebody's home people didn't have water people didn't have food you know these people had nothing their livelihood their life their existence had totally been stripped away from them and what struck me the most about the entire experience all my time there was not once did anyone complain but they lost everything and they didn't complain and they all focused on one thing they focused on change not complaining and because of that I do take it personally when people complain because the truth is most of the time people complain have nothing to complain about who cares if I went to a meeting that doesn't start till tomorrow and who cares if some guy locked up bite brake cable it really doesn't matter broken fix it if you don't like it change it if you want something take it don't complain about it just do something about your trees if you need pretty and is taking friends seem to the baby gym I'm hoping to catch them and go for a second how was your day did you take a nap today do you sleep today this is the baby gym when you say Francine do you think she likes it is funny paperback the office now to catch up before I cut out for the

to catch up by watching it on the Stairmaster at the reflection in these glasses with it you can see my you can see my iphone yeah done Jimin great episode of Game of Thrones home shower dress work go go go I slept nine hours last night that was coming off of a 48-hour no sleep bender I feel like a completely different person today it's like I'm on drugs right way to start the week today's monday so i wanted to spend today's vlog doing another behind the scenes and that's where I like break down an old movie i had made and tell the stories about like how it came to be and what happened behind it but i was looking through my archives here trying to find some footage to support the behind the scenes that I wanted to do today I found something that's really awesome it stars a very drunk Candace my now wife who 10 years ago it's just some baby I was not a hot date with and it's at like four in the morning and we're leaving a bar or something i don't remember what happened was my older brother Dan's bike had been stolen a few days earlier we're in the same neighborhood which is alphabet city I saw these like four dudes leaning up against the wall hanging out and they had vans bike so I gave Candace my camera I gave her my backpack and I remember saying to her whatever happens do not try to help me just call the police if the shit goes down what happened and she didn't do a very good job of capturing this case she's busy filming herself what happened is I just rolled up on these four guys and they're like big thugs and I was like a 24 year old and I just like I remember like being like blind confidence Casey overwhelm them with confidence make these four dudes fear you and I just like rolled up this clenched and like stared into their eyes like a glaring eye contact and then I grab the bike put on my shoulder never broke eye contact and walked away ok here's the video see that he saw his hands like fans but I got stolen last night everything to seize it are you fucking kidding me he's got it and this is like is that then how do you know it is thats a license plate yeah that's that's Van Slyke all right back to you behind the scenes which I'm totally pumped to do today today's gonna be an awesome behind the scenes because these are kind of stories I've never told before this behind the scenes is going to be about a campaign I did which was three four four four separate videos i did for mercedes-benz and this one I want to say this was i want to say like 2014 2013 ok let me just put it on runs on there the mercedes-benz CLA project was a advertising campaign about this car which is the mercedes-benz CLA I got this campaign with them and it was to make for videos so there was never any storyboards any script any outlines there's nothing specific it was all kept incredibly broad which was a really big deal for me especially then because I didn't have the audience then that I have now this was by far the biggest dollar ad campaign I'd ever done it was enough money to enable us to do whatever we wanted to do like no matter how crazy the idea we would have the budget for it the first part this video here this is a little background why like mercedes-benz I happen to drive a Mercedes at the time I did this campaign my history with them cool little video shot most of it here in the studio and it ended on a really kick-ass note which was them dropping off a prototype CLA so we're like the first people to have one ok whatever it is part two Oscar and I was like my best friend he's also like a producer and a filmmaker so Oscar i traveled to Germany and all we brought with this was like skateboards and a couple cameras and we went to the mercedes-benz museum and we went to like their car factory and we have to drive all kinds of like crazy souped-up prototypes ok part 3 this is by far my favorite video of the for video campaign it's playing here the narrative of this video goes like this it shows us starting to do the shoot in New York City with this beautiful girl and then it starts to pour out so we shift gears and we fly to the bonneville salt flats in New Mexico Arizona New Mexico Nevada that's not how it went down what actually happened this is where it gets fun is we went to the Bonneville Salt Flats first and we had this whole enormous shoot scheduled and organized for out there we had a helicopter and airplane for stunts cop cars we had stunt drivers but it was all predicated on the fact that we had a beautiful functioning mercedes-benz CLA to shoot so we went out the night before the shoot to do some testing and I like I wrecked the car know that this was like a handmade prototype that was just made to be like pushed on the showroom floor is wearing white gloves it was not even really meant to be driven we had to cancel the entire shoot the next day and we basically left with what was like a garbage pile of footage and we looked at that footage and were like this isn't we don't have a movie there's not enough here so that was what I was like okay we need to do another shoot and Mercedes was super super cool they got us another car and then we did the second part of the shoot in New York City they wanted something authentic and real and something that felt true not manufactured so the only way your auntie I was to constantly put us in harm's way where things would definitely go wrong and then whatever the outcome was would be our video and that was sort of the thesis behind the campaign and everything else I did Oscar today I'm doing behind the scenes of the CLA project all right what details did I leave out did you talk about what happened to fucking paper and i talked about how he broke the car yeah and the self lat the car was destroyed on my birthday biggest production nightmares ever had to deal with i was trying to have fun and everything that we planned out went to shit immediately first place to destroy the car no spam it wasn't anybody else don't let him just don't say anything a little bit I completely wrecked the car and Oscar had to deal with all the river cut using all the hard work at all I was doing was screwing it up and it was my birthday it is you with that that video turned out being my favorite it was the most accidental which made it the most real which made it just amazing video for was the actual commercial it's one minute long so it actually aunt Edie and you can click and watch it here I worked with my friend game was like a really smart writer and I was like Gabe I just want there to be like a single message here to encapsulate all the ethos behind this entire project that we did which i think is in line with the ethos behind the actual car that Mercedes is trying to sell sometimes in life you just have to say it and we literally made the commercial that says sometimes in life you just have to say it and now I knew that couldn't be shown on TV I still short of mercedes though so we ended up saying sometimes in life you just have to say yes which is probably even better because it's like more positive and people could misconstrue what it actually means that's it Oh what one more interesting too that this literally hurts my be able to admit this someone's ooh min to make it even more serious so for the last video I knew is gonna be more of like a crazy music video montage situation then like a real narrative so the song was everything now this is like three years ago but i just learned about this like australian girl rapper named AE Azalea I wanted her to play the babe was like driving the car with me in the car behind it and I wanted to use her song work now we happen to have like the same agent represents us or same agency or whatever is where we'll be in touch with her and she was totally down to do it for a fee that was completely reasonable it's a higher now be millions and millions and of dollars but nobody who she was then and mercedes-benz said no they didn't think she was gonna be a big deal and they thought that she might be a liability I'm believable anyways okay all right that's why behind the scenes of the mercedes-benz CLA project links to all those movies below just quick disclaimer mercedes-benz doesn't know that i made this behind the scenes where there are disclosing this information on my youtube channel so none of this is endorsed I don't think it'd be mad at me for saying this stuff but i will say that working with them was really super awesome ok that's it",

and opens at the beach so I figured I'd just go buy some tables and I don't give our best shot yeah check out the temperature 102 degrees around the be on the other hand the doors on either so I'm good now this is the most impractical car but there are two occasions when it's amazing number one when there's like two and a half feet of snow on the ground in New York City and number two on a hot

um what I think it's kind of a different way to ask it but - there has to be a certain level of narcissism or ego involved in any one who thinks someone else did about something that create whether you're a photographer a journalist a writer any person who makes something a chef you have to first thing someone else cares about something I care about and that is inherently narcissistic beyond that like what is the artistic merit of logs like are you kidding me like just zoom way out and what is logging logging is one person making a movie from their perspective every day is a capturing and sharing humanity in a way that this medium has never seen before and the profundity that is that the impact that is that the social and cultural impact of this new medium is entirely untold ultimately I think time will tell what the social and cultural significance of this new genre called vlogging really is I'm betting that it's huge Amelia asks why use that heavy camera i use that camera because my camera philosophy is to always use whatever the best camera is I have at my disposal so sometimes that's like only my cell phone and that's good enough but if I have access to this big care that i'm shooting on now which yields a very nice image it sounds good I'm always going to use the biggest best camera on a scale of one to 10 how much you rate of logging making Internet videos as a career I would put it in the same spaces like if you want to be a singer a painter if you want to be an actor musician if you want to work in the creative space your likelihood of succeeding in this space is about the same as it is in any other space which is to say it's extremely challenging it's extremely competitive and success is elusive but the opportunity is always there I feel awkward vlogging and talking to my camera in public how do you become so relaxed about it you've got two choices Bjorn either you're going to let what other people think about you keep you from making something or you're just a safe it and not care what they think so you can make something it's a pretty easy that's a pretty easy question don't worry about other people think what's the most important thing you would say to beginner about filmmaking i would say this generically to anyone who has a dream or an aspiration in life which is don't give up you will fail a thousand times but then you'll succeed and most people like to give up after they fail because that's what it feels like that's when you're supposed to give up like that I tried I failed time to quit I totally disagree so you're really happens when you decided that you know are going to pursue that dream like that's the moment of failure that's the point when you turn the corner from on your way to success to failing okay i hope you enjoyed the Q&A today I have to stop and get back to work the bracelet back all right that's my camera that's the lens what do you see a morons soldier that's its army is amazing footage of myself and mr. happy make sure you follow me on twitter at brother owns",

yo dawg Jack Griffin - I was really pumped on my 360 experience from last week Griffin here is on the Virtual Reality team at Discovery the discovery channel Discovery Network also he's also never been on a hoverboard before he's giving me and Jack a little tutorial about how you use like really high-end 360 year because he's like the world's leading expert on that I'm not getting that out it's booked by the way ok this is this is the behind the scenes for the 360 shoot i'll stay up there right yeah ready power on whoever set out there jack ok so i'm in the hallway of my building right now

devin's first time visiting the studio first time in person I'm excited about this I seen all of like going to assume that they're just for that reason ok the reason why this mirror is here is because there's a camera here a half and a camera here ok so if you put a mirror here people always stare at themselves and not notice the cameras it's a fad insider scope yeah Wow and that camera they're just so we can see right here to see what's use out thursday at the door team super trip so if I had to describe the work that Devon here does whether you've definitely seen his work if you think for

2000 our camera and 600 our cameras like this this thing's ok it's about a hundred bucks now he spent two dollars more you get one of these the quality goes way up and the price only goes up a little bit now if you spend three dollars more than that you get one of these for 600 bucks the quality goes way over here but the price hasn't moved much now if you go from 600 to 6,000 the price goes way up and the quality only moves a little bit as you spend more you get less and less for your return story story is all that matters story is golden story since the top of that gigantic pyramid that is filmmaking they do another diagram the story is king everything serves the king all of this is just here to serve the story defining what a story is is really really hard to do not sure there's actually a generic formula to telling stories you have to find something that an audience is interested in and then share with them in a way that they're also interested in the only way to learn these things and get better at these things is by doing it over and over and over we have all these tools that enable us to create in ways that are more accessible that are cheaper that are more fair that's what excites me the most I hope that was helpful for you if you're an aspiring filmmaker YouTube creator however you classify yourself ok sup guys my name is anthony five-team user name is sky diver and you should follow me because i'm under can be right now above colorado follow me remember my being user name is sky diver",

            "subtitles": "you will not break it a little chubby case you never know you might hit that wall but you will those rings will not fall what should the being be today all right I got something just before i get into the Q&A today this thing just happened and it's happened to me before and every time it's super-crazy frustrating but what happens is on the side of your memory card of your SD card there's this little switch that makes it so you can't record over it it's called like a right protected scratch see there's like a little lock button right there ok and when you insert it into the let me show you here's where the memory card goes in here is the memory card the locks which is right there as you slide it in that switch gets locked and then you go to report that super frustrating here's a little modification that i'm going to do for the first time now as a completely reckless and irresponsible experiment to show you how to prevent that from happening I give this modification a very strong do not try at home recommendation you're going to need a little bit of a hot glue and then some fire you want to melt just a little bit of it you don't need too much it's good you take your memory card and you wanted action it's a little bit ok now the spot where the slider would normally go into has been filled up with hot glue but there's one last important step you have to take a razor blade and cut away all the excess hot glue because this is like a precision memory card the size of it is very precise and have to go into your camera into what is like into what is like a very very narrow slot so any excess glue will like dunk it up and also will prevent it from sliding in and out smoothly that's what she said this is a little bit easier than you think but you really want to be careful here ok I think it's done now it slide smoothly in and out without any chance of getting caught on that stupid little switch has no business being there in the first place now I can start the Q&A Casey i'm outside ok not gonna start the Q&A just yet on this week's Q&A special guest has arrived he's just outside let's go get them ok nice that was you right homie with a buddy to see you again man welcome you need a tour I definitely need a tour of this place ok what she's asking me questions and i'll answer my eyes are I want to know what this is what is this week so every one of these pictures up here the ones that line the top each one of those drawings over here all these ones up top here these are all animations from my movies a lot of them like the one you just point that this happened one the taxi was for a movie i need for the New York Times called 13,000 238 daughter makes sense left in a taxi i will link that movie below and Link it right here I was going to title of my movie that but you ready took it outside how long have you been in here I've been here for like 13 years hang on these are of course i love the thing when you get up there i'm going to try to muscle up I can't do it well I break it and you will not break it up a little trouble Casey oh my gosh wait a minute Sarah they're coming back hold on guys important thing where i printed fucking cago aconcagua was the tallest mountain in the southern hemisphere and I climbed in a few years ago I came back my brother van maybe that technic painting why are you such a go getter what in your life cause you to be so unique to like do all this cool stuff you know I don't know the answer to that question I think it's a harder question I think it's like that is sort of a process of life as any decision you never wake up you're like I want to do this but throughout life you know what the biggest motivators people telling me know or that I couldn't do it really that's what pushes the harvest do you ready to start this Q in Iowa let's a some cute ok now we can finally start the Q&A this week's theme on like here looks good over with the hat on top well this is a shameless plug for Shay Carly's company picks and check it out - I see the app i just downloaded the team and it sticks out way better than the snapchat thing i like that you shameless plug me I shameless plug you i scratch your back okay this for those of you who don't know I can't imagine there's any of you don't know who this guy is this is shay carl he is one of the original bloggers on youtube he's like the how many views all in how many of you well on the Shaytards are about to get two billion but billion with Abbi Ilana's page doesn't get pranked sorry walkie-talkies like my superintendent walkie-talkies ok 2 billion views it's incredibly like super positive uplifting optimistic blogging that has had a huge impact on the way that I shared stories from my life in my family thanks man so the blog theme Diaspar today was ask his questions about family / blogging and we're using Twitter video because everybody seemed to like that from last week I'm just going to Center you I feel like there's a little bit too much JC and that point enough is never enough cases ok here we go first question coming from any stuff that's my daughter's name Emily what's the hardest part about putting your life on the internet every single day we were just talking about this off camera it's scary it's scary to like because we all have weaknesses right we all have things that we do or like or say that other people might not think is as good as you think so it's hard to really open yourself up because you feel vulnerable it's like what if those things I think and say or do are cool like what if people don't like me because of those things so it's hard to have that self-confidence to be able to like this is me I don't care what you think about it but this is really Who I am ok next question from Dave hit your shed ever have family members friends complain about you guys blocking constantly if that happens when you guys do to deal with it I mean I think it's the same for me it's the same for family members friends or even strangers which is if somebody is uncomfortable or doesn't want it at all you just don't do it no and that's true especially for Candice everybody's like Candace hates being in the blog if Candice ever says I don't want to be and we just don't shoot it what would you guys be you youtube videos where would we be if we were making YouTube videos manual labor factory punching the clock somewhere hating my existence until I retired this question from a girl named Gigi che do you ever get tired of lobbying every question was for you my friend I don't blog every day I didn't vlog every day for five years now I'm like three or four days a week but it's hard because there's sometimes where you're like I just don't know I want to lay around the house all day long I don't feel like being in a good mood alright a question from Brittany Casey it's nice Frances I wish I talk about your day okay okay i'm at me but this question is for Casey how long are you going to be flogging like are you going to continue to keep long after year let us know I saw a video where he said you're never gonna stop I don't deny saying that you said you promise you'll never stop blog you guys right leave in the comments he said that Brittany great question i said in my very first blog that I would keep logging until it stopped being interesting and you know ben Brown yeah yeah yeah then is a great friend you know tremendously brilliant blogger you should follow him by the way only 10 below then said to me something really interesting what he said was he was like I know what happens if i keep blogging but I don't know what happens if i stop log that's a good and when he said that it just shook me up and he's like my life everything I do is getting so much better since I've gone down this friday i feel like a much more productive effective better human being because i'm forced to sort of examine my own life every day and I really like that to stop is an unknown that I just I'm not curious about right now out I feel like I'm sitting at the bottom of a gigantic not looking up and I don't want to stop until i'm standing at the top and I get that has a tattoo on my back this next question is from Captain med and Captain ahmed we can't figure out what country or military force you serve in but let us know let me show you see I want to ask about what is composed of why it's low key while long i don't know but i made a movie about when Francine was born and when I was making it like it felt fairly inconsequential like it was just a crazy day trying to make it to the hospital in time and I filmed it and even edited the video and can't stand watching is so cute to have this moment of our daughter being born and now she's like almost a year old and I played that movie last week or two weeks ago for a big audience and like it right crushing me it crushed me so having these movies I've made 10 movies about Owen my relationship with own having these movies that capture a moment in my life as a parent or as a husband a moment that if I didn't create YouTube videos I wouldn't have otherwise whatever is to me like that is the most fantastic like do we end this now let me just give a quick disclaimer for Shay i'm going to edit you and take you out of context to make this blog move more quickly find me more exciting so i'll try to mischaracterize who you are thank you i appreciate them okaay - next week for more vlog DNA's with other awesome people not that I'm awesome I'm just don't cut yourself short man you are servants

is gonna go with friends into your house shopping and don't know what I'm going to do this morning will then for super scattered and has lacked any sort of cohesion and that's because I I knew what I was doing today anyway at least what part of my day was not a zero intention of locking it but i came here and i have been incredibly encouraged to film something so I'm not bringing you here with me to be a part of what I've been up to today and why do you want me to film you in hitman because this is you know this is real this is who I am at this moment and there's my urine isn't that exciting yeah I mean I like blue it's out did you tell us what a pathetic uh well I recently had surgery to remove a star , which is cancer from my leg and now i am just stuck in a bed for a week how the DJ I'm 27 years old when did you find out you had cancer about three weeks ago what was the first thing that went through your head honestly the first thing that went through my head this might sound of it was that I still had so many things to make and I was like dang it I can't die there's so many other things i have to create and that was really like hit me really hard i was like well what kind of make like a family of five months to live that was like the first pot so I'm trying to arrived at he had done where do you want to go direct me what I would love and I mean this is the exercise I do all the time I'm like always in a place where I'm like constantly asking myself and I finally have this much more time of what I look back and wish I have done differently and then I come up with an answer and then I do that immediately because i don't want to be full of regret if I find out that like my fuse is being shortened you had to face that reality when we make things and i'll talk to you and you when we make things that's who we are that's a piece of us that's captured forever and we're honest I think we make things it's really the creativity of who we are and so bummed me out the most was that I didn't make enough stuff and I kind of thought what was the last video I actually spent the whole week thinking about what was the last video that i make be and I had like I came up with this why they even wrote like the outline for it that was kinda went through my head is I didn't make enough things because there's still so much I need to share I guess the good news is the prognosis for Jake is really good you can be fine right yeah be fine just have a weird leg they had a top of a part of his leg he's not gonna die he's gonna be good and thank you for being too honest a chair I mean it like that means a lot to me and I hope you guys can appreciate how meaningful this is thanks for visiting me when I'm like a disaster my hair is not good oh look at this look you look great also by the way if you don't know this guy is i will link his youtube channel below he has one of the best channels on all of the internet thank you all right look like someone putting the camera way now bye yeah I really meant that when i said i had no intention of filming in there and I think it's a testament to Jake and just how positive an incredible that is one of the first things he said the music where's your camera I do weekly Q&A is in this log and one of the questions that springs up fairly often is what is your biggest fear and my response is always the same my biggest fear is getting sick is this is not fair like its boot and like I'm about to get on a motorcycle right now and I think if you crash your motorcycle and . like that's fair because motorcycles are dangerous you shouldn't be on a motorcycle that is a risk you take but being sick getting cancer that's not fair especially in someone like Jake's case is 27 years old he's totally positive up there nothing but smiles he's an amazing guy you look like a criminal as having fun and say it's late now baby's asleep we left the baby with canvas is mom we're going for a walk this is lovely California this weathers that wonderful it's like 55 degrees and its color hat it's not that much closer than that what's the weather what did you say it was what is it 55 65 Maxie and it do you want some water

at a time all week today I want to make a point of leaving the office getting out of your household is how busy I am I gotta get outside yeah yeah well I this is my first pussy board encounter with ice not good right worth noting avoid ice at all costs yeah is not a very interesting outing i am simply headed to the apple store because my iphone is reached that place where it's six months old to the battery lasts until like 10:30 in the morning like i said i'm not a very interesting outing Casey hey doing how are you man love yourself and I think gold party historically apples always been really cool with me filming in their stores but after the spray paint the apple watch gold situation they trying to got uptight about it so if i have to cut the camera off on there that that's why hi do it so my options are the mophie which i already have and it's good for the apple one which is maybe the ugliest thing I've ever seen but it has the apple logo on it which i'm a total sucker for you i bought what may be the ugliest to apple product i've ever seen this battery case thing I want no joke I drop this camera probably once maybe twice a week when i say drops I mean critical drops from altitude that I camera with this many moving parts has no business being dropped from and it survives that is a testament to the canon 70d okay i want to do like a quick kind of review of this day I think I already figured out a critical flaw which means i have to take it back but let me check it out first all right love to say that like this is a comprehensive review of this ugly apple case but i think the reality is there's not much to out this is not critical flaws worried about you got your beats you want to listen to some sweet jams there's like this long tunnel right here that this long and this doesn't fit through it Apple how do you have what at what jony ive's at what point in time do you think this is okay so now i have to take it back I think I'd like to continue with this theme this Apple Computer theme for today's blog yeah this this was the first ever computer ever that I ever edited video on ever the year was 2000 y2k just past the dot-com bubble had burst the Concorde crashed in front of your Putin had just been voted in and Bill Clinton was about to leave office that was the year i got this thing this is an imac DV braids in and this was the first machine to ship with imovie on it I movie version one point out at the time I was washing dishes for a living but when i first played this thing I was like I have to have it and I max out my credit card and got one and I did the same for a video kit and I get the same for my video camera this is my first video camera to give you a war story this they had a 10 gigabyte hard drive for context my point shoot that i use now I keep a I keep a hundred and twenty eight gigabytes just in my point and shoot in this entire computer only a 10 gig hard drive and it a 10 gig hard drive was like 12 minutes of video so i would edit 12 minutes of video and then export it to tape and they're completely delete my file and then I start editing the next part of the video and then i would try to like join them on the tape that was the battle back in the day the reason why I bring all this up now is because i am a huge apple fanboy I would like anything with an apple logo on it case in point this ridiculous thing and that's because I feel indebted to this company it was because of their technology that enabled my career and that is a really big deal as if that wasn't enough in 2003 it was a movie I made about apple's ipod that was like definitely one of my first big breaks for me to show you all right i mean this is it like every newspaper but this guy that's me . it says in his film ipods dirty secret Casey nice that spray paints an apple poster blah blah blah it was that movie that i made it my brother which is about e which is about the ipods unreplaceable battery at the time that really liked was the first time I'd ever blown anything up the first time anyone ever heard my name so that's why I'm an apple fanboy I still love apple and I guess very bad what are you doing here I'm working for Oscar now I'm coming this afternoon well that's major huh yeah send it is officer around now he wants to go meet with them anything I know how are you how's your baby well there is happening what's up dude why are you limping I wrecked my motorbike and Nicaragua that's the coolest story ever heard they're like four Nicaraguan kids just staring at me as my leg was covered in blood just like like a proper motorcycle accident you went down there was a river in the middle of the road that I didn't see and I should have charged it but I slammed on the brakes then I get it out the bike landed on my leg all things considered super lucky one question how do you not see a river from to have friends Kingston didn't sleep all the way down bye guys this out I love those guys after some consideration they only keep it was so ugly",

network it's a company that i started with my friend Matt a year ago it used to be like the only thing I talked about on the vlog was being it was all about my company but in the last like six months I haven't mentioned it not once have been getting a lot of flack for it in the comments below like what's going on is it out of business are you still running your company why don't you talk about it so today i want to explain what's going on exactly what you're not so like a year and a half ago or something like that I started this company called beam with this idea that like could we build an app could we build a way we share video we are excited to make any video so how to make videos on beams I just go and now it's recording video and then I go and now that video has been shared everyone who follows me and that's it and it's like this awesome little platform we built this thing we launched it last July they caught in the launch was like totally not that's my studio and that's being beam headquarters is awesome we've got a couch this projector situation which we used mostly for work but sometimes sometimes for video games we got Alex and Steve working on a Sunday upon that we got snacks lots and lots and lots of snacks in fact all the snacks that show up from mail time whether it's unhealthy for super healthy all that ends up here and the beam squad has a magical way of making it disappear then after that crazy launch when we raise more money and then we hired a whole bunch of people we have this new office we just started like building building building and then like people sort of stopped downloading being and a lot of people stop using being and started to fade away and were like what's going on here and Matt my business partner i realized that like this up kind of sucks like the idea is awesome but the app itself is not it needs to be better so in January we sat down like the entire team all of being squad and we're like how do we make this thing better and we think we figured out we think with your how to make it the awesome app it needed to be that way to build it and that took us the last like five months four and a half months to make it the thing that should have been we launched to make it great and I read all the comments i read everybody asking with your beam is it over there are you still doing it why don't you talk about it every time I mention the name beam people download it and then we didn't want downloads it wasn't ready so i had to stop talking about it was so painful for me to not talk about it so today finally we launch the app on the App Store and on the google play store go download it check it out it sucks just delete it if you like it with oh but more importantly I will be once again talking about my job which is being on this channel and hopefully people can stop asking why are you talking about being because i will now be talking about being also i launched the second video today it just explains what beam is if you if you don't know what beam is check it out steinberger Oh Casey I have you go pro I'm sorry i'd like to return it it's okay probably i'll give it to you right now ok working on a sunday yeah your friend Allison the hell it was amazing I'm going to your tomorrow this is probably a terrible idea but I feel like the city is so empty and it's so dark out it's the perfect opportunity to meet please try any what could possibly go wrong ok little weird i did not tell it to fly over there it just took off and took off all right I didn't wreck the drone but definitely applies funny with these lights on it or I'll just doing something wrong kind of amazing it looks like a spaceship is fly to get inside before you're in trouble sounds like somebody's having fun and it wasn't invited it's casey",

first one has this man ok oh my God all this you did my God look at her Candace as a rule doesn't come to the studio because she buys it too stressful so I let her dig into the Francine archives i keep a pretty tight archive of cute pictures and videos of friends always together they anyway she's digging deep I'm getting some needed gear i like broke all my gear in the last weekend away gotta remember those swings gives me nightmares we're flying to cape town we take 80 inches that little yeah and I feel back by myself remember look at the if i cant we're gonna watch that are you sure you want to yeah there's no one watching it when can this was getting having the baby they like film i had my GoPro and I was like I don't want to film the gross stuff and the doctors like a cowboy in Texas took the camera and film the gross stuff I've never looked at it she's looking at it i'm going to hide in here is that it like like broke my arm broke my microphone was pretty my camera my backpack this is one of the most common problems and if you know a way to fix this let me know but where the microphone jack goes into the camera sticks out like this when i put in my background it always breaks by the sound is so often messed up in my videos luckily i keep a pretty solid inventory of equipment here in the office to suit by every so there's some new stuff here but the new equipment arrived when I wasn't here and got a chance to play with it yet i do want this per watt and pretty this is a GoPro selfie step it's still me right now push the button it's going over there me over there over there over there amazing company called speedo makes these thank you's people for sending them over this is pretty next level image stabilizer for cell phone and go pro I can't wait he is this are you watching a nasty stuff are you crying regarding microphones I typically use one of two microphones I like this I like this road microphone lot solid microphone lately I've also been using these sure microphones they're great slightly different sound profile but just as good of a camera more recently sennheiser came out with this microphone i haven't used it yet but sanitizer makes great products and I'm really looking forward to this also i put on these dead cats on this and it really kills any and all wind it's this fuzzy thing that gives me sucked clean sound like when I'm riding my skateboard in the wind talking to Cameron it still sounds good because this very thing honey we gotta go have fun watching the archives yeah you didn't know your back your back when you get back yesterday actually each other and I know when we're in venice on our vacation Oscar was also in Venice and he was literally 200 feet from us and we were able to connect i had healed men all right yeah that pretty much concludes our afternoon date have to head back down relieve the babysitter in conclusion we went to lunch and then went to lunch and then we walked in my office and Candice watch the baby videos and now we took a taxi cab home and i'm not just by the water and just to do nothing except sharing space was the best part of the yeah you are so baby going down for a nap i have to pack i hate packing because i'm terrible at package gotta gotta gotta gotta bring my tuxedo here trouble is I don't know that actually have a tuxedo it's ready to this is all right so you always have trouble prioritizing what to bring my tuxedo and my drove what typically i try not to be cagey about where I'm going or what I'm doing but I had to promise not to reveal the details of this trip and told monday night at 8pm so i cant even sure where I'm going I can't share why I'm doing there I really need to review all the details soon really soon I just like you know a day for you to bear with me yeah in the drawer to the left of the self you got it right yeah no big deal in other mildly exciting news i'm flying virgin atlantic sorry never flown virgin atlantic before the line here virgin is like a mile long so let's sew up this boosted board that while i wait i bought this bag aftermarket like it wasn't made by boost its made by some I don't know was expensive though it's completely falling apart of this the strap ripped off and buckles broke and I had to put these carabiners on as the plastic ones broke broke over here trying to stitch this back together here really have nothing but disdain for low quality products and you know the high-quality booster for back let me know and i don't want a gun bag or like a pool cue bag that's we made just for boosted boards otherwise it's a nuisance currently enroute to the Virgin lounge which I've never been to that Candace speaks of highly so expect a comprehensive review of this lounge ready for a tour daddy menu captures magazines computers stranger captain-general around what appears to be a hair salon for a second bar red pool table TV luggage storage facilities at work color-changing hallway toilet all it all seems like a really nice lounge everybody in here super friendly not too crowded and the food's delicious yeah yeah a pic but good man i'd really love your stuff it's guys get to drive a flaw thanks for not leaving without me a far walk to make a lot of friends on this airline yeah hi and no I'll take a paper thank you very much shameless now I didn't bring my regular sweat pants pyjamas and his homie they give me a pair and they did its can pretty closing like in the first part of this episode i complained about microphones and go to my studio and I get a new microphone and then spontaneously the shot when I go into the closet the sound gets totally fine and nowhere and that's why I like okay I like that but you really left that's called peaking lights at the top I don't know why it does that I changed no settings it like does that on its own this is why we smash my camera so frustrated when stuff like this sorry I'm sorry about the the low sound quality for the second

and this is a good question for me to end this Q&A on one of my biggest goals for 2016 is to just completely double down on youtube going to 2015 when i started blogging I talked about sort of why YouTube to me why you to the world is so so relevant as an artist as a filmmaker as someone who who likes to share ideas and perspectives why youtube is so important and going into 2016 I feel different about that in that I'm even more passionate about that idea i think the relevance of this medium has only gone up in the last year and I want to invest everything I can in to that ok that's it for thats it for Q&A today la 2015 thats it for Q&A I'll see you in the next unit which will be in 2016 her last night in California we are spending it on the beach enjoying the sunset pretty special also this is my sister who also that's Francine hi buddy thank you where yeah and that is the last sunset of our trip to Los Angeles you want to get food you're not getting back down in the sand skateboards are so much cooler than of reports",

that's questions and answers say roll the intro yeah question yeah all right let's get started here are the questions all right what is freedom I i think i stole this from Bob Dylan but maybe I suppose from Woody Guthrie freedom for me is waking up in the morning and going to sleep at night and in between doing exactly what I want to do only Cynthia wants to know k see if you weren't a filmmaker what would you be if I wasn't making movies I'd like to be an astronaut or a professional athlete or I I don't really know all I've ever known is making movies chris wants to know how much longer do you think you can keep your blog going I don't know how much longer I can sustain this but i can tell you like each day I invest deeper into it which makes it harder for me to stop what's the secret to happiness the secret to happiness is finding something you love and then doing that for the rest of your life I stole that from Rushmore so you can add a lot I think you just got to find something you love to do and then do with the rest of your life Jonas wants to know are you afraid of running out of stories to tell no in the progress that shot got a camera wants to know what is your favorite book my favorite book is The Autobiography of Malcolm X I've read that book like three times twice in a row and you can pretty much learned everything you need to know about life in that book Rebecca wants to know film school or no film school what's the best way to make a career in the film industry the truth is there are no defined paths in the film industry meaning if you could go to school and be taught here's how to succeed in the film industry everyone would do it because this is the greatest job ever what it takes is defining your own path the best piece of advice I have for someone trying to succeed in the film industry or any creative space is if you're doing what everyone else is doing you're doing it wrong do you snap chat less now that you do the daily vlogs no Gavin wants to know what is your new business how about this Gavin I will talk about my new business in tomorrow's vlog I'll talk about in a little there's like look they're like all these cars and trying to report of audio like sooo na and all I can hear is a helicopter buzzing hell's going on that's what was interrupting my Q&A there appears to be some sort of protest going on not sure what this protest is but I will find out so this is a protest against police brutality in response to the recent police killings of unarmed italian-american gonna say i really liked seeing this happen in my town especially because like the cops around here walking with the protesters it's all peaceful this is one of the reasons why i love new york city all right that's it I'm cutting the Q&A I'm

now you're seeing this tomorrow so tomorrow will mean that yesterday was being day but tomorrow is yesterday is today and today is being day and beam day is crazy nuts the second thing you need to know I didn't sleep at all last night I laid down in the office for like 15 minutes at 5am so I'm a little bit loopy today so if i don't make any sense in today's log just know it's like because of total exhaustion I'm not on drugs or anything I just like it's been so long since I've slept we have a lot of visitors the office k we have kids waiting outside with balloons theme day is a crazy day crazy or what's going on out there is a lot of people outside morning I'm going down there yeah I in turn out the blog I'll coming down ok yeah ok hey its beam day I've got a whole cacophony of things to talk about regarding beam before i do during last week's mail time I said something to the effect of whenever I open up mail time boxes I get scared that there's gonna be a human head inside that was a joke I just want to say to whatever wiseass sent me this today you totally freaked me out this is as far as I get ok and I open this out flip try to tell me this wouldn't freak you out ok what does that look like in there ok then you pull away what does that look like that's red and then it's like sticky and biological looking and it's shaped like a skull this is a human head made out of like gummy bear material this is disgusting and you completely freaked me out when I opened it very funny please no one else any human heads what I can do it feels gross on today's program we're going to cover three things all pertaining to beam number number one pro tips number two who number number two who to follow and number three we're going to like a short Q&A yesterday I should i use it like this and that does work really well but you don't have to hold it against your chest see it just works off this sensor up here you can really see on a white phone like see that . the little one right above that your whole thing that . right there is the sensor cover that and it starts recorded so what that means is like you can definitely just go like this and it records or if you want to talk to the camera you like this and then talk to the camera being isn't just about holding your phone against your chest the principle behind that is it's about not looking at your phone while you capture and if you're holding up like this and the screen is black there's not a whole lot to look at you're not interrupting the moment for the phone with that there's some fun stuff you can do with it this is my favorite thing to do while I'm riding my bicycle or I'm gonna skateboard ready because of like captures exactly what I'm looking at and because I'm holding it to my face pics up your voice really well so it's great for narration you do kind of look like enough lead in your phone like this though now each clip is four seconds long only four seconds law if you pull it away before four seconds it cancels the post but your beam can be as long as you want it to be if you want to be longer just keep capturing more clips when it comes to sending reactions it's really fun to send a whole bunch of them so one thing I like to do while I'm watching somebody's beam is just to keep reacting and move my head slightly like this or spin around slightly and then when the person looking at my reactions if they tap fast enough it almost looks like a stop frame movie ok I think that's it for pro tips next time the mood to follow beams brand new so most users have no idea how to use the platform or how to do really interesting things on it yet but there are a couple of people that have been our beta for a while I that have really found their voice so here are three recommends number one is my friend ben Brown his user name is Ben that's a ridiculously good user name I had recommend you check out then because their lives in south africa he's always traveling like the last week all of his being for from Zambia and like the Zambezi River he's like a really positive guy who is always on an adventure so i would check out then next up is my friend Sean Duras it's like the country honduras in the name Sean combined Sean Duras sean is just like he's one of the happiest most lovely human beings I've ever met on being he tells these like really amazing almost like intimate little stories from his life like yesterday almost mrs. airplane and his whole beam was about racing to the airport and like it started and over on his way to the airport and that being ended literally in the cockpit of the plane so definitely check out Shawn Duras Sean just posted let's let's check out one of his beams about drama dead serious all right the last person that I want to recommend his name is in harris now Harris is like a young guy who lives here in New York City and he does things on being that I didn't think you could do he has shirts and he keeps his phone in his harris also invented a couple of really weird techniques like he built this like hand strap for his phone so record like that need one thing that I love he checks his phone and he tucks it into his belt so it looks like this and then you can record hands-free it says a bunch of really weird really awesome things on being so definitely check out Harris such and three which is Q&A now normally i do my q and A's by going on Twitter saying ask me questions but all I've been getting all day our questions about being so thank you guys for the number one question I've been getting is is being going to be on Android and the answer is yes one hundred percent i do carry an android phone in addition to my iphone so what will be available on Android soon we'll have an app on android we can reserve your name and we're going to release that before release the full app on android because that's going to take longer but it's happening and it's not like a year away it's happening it's going to happen like as soon as possible we really wanted on Android our mission here the the principle that all of our decisions that beam revolve around the goal that we're trying to accomplish is to promote empathy by sharing perspective and what that means is if you can see the world from everyone's perspective you better understand who other people are and how they live and limiting that to one ecosystem really limit the effectiveness of a platform like being a man hell yeah <street> sixtieth </street> thank you I said I did i just did Thank You programs really excited to be getting out of the office early I didn't really get to see friends seen yesterday so i'm making sure i'm home in time tonight to give her back and put her to bed hello there hello did you have a great day really mom giving your mixing bowl you're gonna make some toys soup no dad that see Dad what do you do with that who's in jail who's in jail haha have a baby yeah yeah",

And soon because of Obamacare all restaurants with more than 20 locations will be required to post calorie counts. It's like how the FDA requires labels on packaged foods. the idea is pretty basic when you know how much you're eating attend to eat {Blank} Now, Section 81 50 of the new york city health code states the health department will cite violations if you fail to post calorie information. But the health department doesn't verify the accuracy of that information. they told me no one checks to make sure these numbers are correct so i thought i'd assume that responsibility. The actual process for testing caloric content is incredibly complicated and horribly boring. Tt involved two food scientists who were totally patient and answered all of my stupid questions. And it's pronounced \"cal-o-ri-me-ter?\" Calorimeter. Okay got it. We needed the resources of the obesity research lab at st. Luke's Hospital. It involved precision beyond anything I'm capable of... and a lot of math. It took us 10 hours to test five items How much do you stand-- how much do you stand behind today's results? 100%. Now, there's very little science put in the selection of food to be tested. I just tried to pick all the foods that I might eat a single day, some from restaurants, some packaged. These muffins are everywhere in the city but the nutritional information is impossible to find. They're called yogurt muffins, and the guy at the bodega said... \"they are low-fat.\" They're low-fat? It's on the sign there - all yogurt muffins.",

here where I'm going to be doing my talk it is so humid out right now that the lens is all blurry this is just gonna have to be the soft focus episode there are a lot of questions in the comments yesterday about what are these talks that i do how do i do then why do i do then what do I talked about yesterday in brazil i was talking about online marketing in and mainstream traditional media versus new media today's event called and econ here in Colombia is much more of a business industry event where they're talking about what they're talking about information technologies and everything in between they invite me to these things because my background in in television and then feature films and then in journalism and then in technology and all of these different trajectories of my career is taking me on has provided me with a perspective that the kinds of people that attend these events want to hear from honor of being invited to these like great events prior to travel to like exotic countries and I come here and I connect with like a huge audience and speak them about all kinds of stuff question that I saw like a thousand times was do i get paid for these well yes and no for academic lectures like last year I spoke at Yale and i was invited to speak at Harvard this year and then I spoke at MIT to students in their mba program those kinds of things like no I don't get I don't get paid for those sorts of things but ones that are more for-profit ones that people actually pay admission to sometimes I do get paid and that's amazing but all of them almost without exception always pay for my travel and help me get there so it really is like an awesome excuse to travel and then when i get to wherever I'm going it's a great way to engage with like people from the other side of the planet who are doing something similar to what i do that's what today is about to change anything it's almost time i get my present alive yes is that many have nobody solution we're gonna be some press interviews now we're almost done because i wasn't called casein and stuff thank you for filming thank you guys hoping well ready where she came to the presentation i think it went

like just using the built-in microphone as in no microphone just like here I mean like that's just the camera there no microphone whatsoever okie dokie and lastly now you're listening to the new fancy microphone let me know which one you think sounds best in the comments below I would prefer if you would just say the fancy one sounds basket I just felt like 20 50 bucks on this thing is what it looks like ok now we can get started under something a little bit different today which is Kennison I have been fighting like last four days and obviously i don't remember why it was one of those situations like she got mad and because she was mad that made me mad and then because i need mean that add that made her even more mad which then made me mad which in return they made her mad in the end just landed on a place where you're like wait why are we fighting with that I want to make today's Q&A about love romance relationships all that stuff and in the name of honesty and full disclosure i would like to advise you the viewers of this blog to disregard every piece of advice I give about love and relationships because i am not in any way qualified to be giving advice on love or relationships in fact any worse person you can possibly take advice from ok let's get started what did you do that you know you're gonna make me all happy when I broke my leg and I was in the hospital like in a million pieces Candace I were broken up I was literally seeing someone else and she showed up in the hospital and did not leave untold they released me from the hospital and in fact when they did release me she was the one who like drove me back to Connecticut for recovery and then took care of me and put up with all of the bullet that was like a broken that wounded Casey that is like hey do you think that everybody only have one way out there for them or do you think that we all have different people set up for us to find these people and no i don't believe that there's only one person out there for each of us generally like rules like that especially if they have to do with relationships or emotions or anything that's entirely malleable an undefinable I would disregard we got this idea that we have like a soul mate and that's it I would that was created by somebody like a Hallmark store disney somebody was looking to sell something the cons are being in a relationship so frozen trials of being in a relationship with the cons are it's really hard a lot of work you get to a point in your life where you want to share your life with somebody else and the cost of that which is high becomes worth it for the opportunity to actually share you are with somebody else but you look young it just looks like you're like high school or college or something the value of like a serious relationship at your age is like just get out there Casey which always wanted how do i get along with my baby mama really well she's awesome like she's totally supportive obviously only we had a fight in the last 16 years change yeah relationship change that we are very surprising with it got easier because once you're married more specifically what you have like a big wedding and you force all of your friends to celebrate with you it makes it a lot harder to like bitch so when you're dating it was like if things got hard I was just like balance and don't date somebody else but once you're married you can't do that because then I'd be like a total jerk to candice's parents who flip the bill for the whole wedding I mean that's not the only reason things got better after we got married but yeah everything changed after we got married I would definitely say everything changed for the better relationships whether traveling k Cody first of all thank you for your service my little brother served in the US Air Force distance is impossible I was never able to deal with it I don't think that's very good for helpful advice especially for someone who's in the armed forces like yourself but i don't know i would hope that Cody you're a bigger man than I and you can figure it out but I each Alice Alice right not to be overly romantic i am a romantic if there's somebody you love that much that you genuinely believe you'll be with forever then you have to just do whatever it takes to be with that person if you truly think that you're going to be with somebody for ever do it ever it takes to be with that person forever if you found someone special snatch them up strong relationship and I have an answer it's gonna require any doing a little Drive and all right the key to a long relationship this is you you and this is and this is your partner and that could mean wife husband boyfriend girlfriend whatever however you identify this screen . here is the relationship now the key to a long marriage is to maintain your sense of you and for your partner to maintain their sense of being and then together you share a relationship you stay you he or she stays who they are and together you share this the problem with most relationships is that somebody in the relationship for both people think the only way to succeed is like this is to give up you is to give up you and instead have this thing together where you give up your sense of identity and you just have this like that's it there's no more you there's no more than me there's just the relationship and that will never work this alone is the key I hope that makes some sense because that's something i really believe in something I really subscribe to its why encourage Candace to keep doing your own thing with her business it's why I keep running and and make my videos and do everything that that makes me me she does everything that makes her her and then together we have this thing called our relationship and get back to work ok today is not mail time and I just got this package from Red Bull check this out this is some serious Harry Potter action this is the letter okay look it's a letter you turn it on click play on the letter and it plays a movie now luckily unsounded by some of the most capable computer scientists on planet Earth so I'm going to have these guys

the baby up I thought she had taken it happen she hadn't and this morning we're going to look at another school for her which I had forgotten about and actually wore ripped jeans but you never are supposed to wear when you're presenting yourself as a parent to a school that you're applying to pour your kit the baby doesn't come now just us visit us is it okay that I wear these pants I don't know if you saw this this is a man named casey nice that I believe nice saturday he said he decided to take advantage of the snow in a crazy way he attached a rope to a jeep anyone snowboarding all over New York City what's up guys I just watching L&O welcome this is a team from YouTube we're talking to you to stuff it down there already smart have you or your brother or you can take a selfie k the YouTube team has left they were great they were here just talking about you know building a bigger youtube community here in New York ok today is Tuesday that means it's time the theme of this week's Q&A is viral videos only seems appropriate because of my snowboard video which is still going viral and therefore i want to milk it for all it's worth by continuing to talk about it hey Casey so what's it like to have a video go viral and how many have you had that one it's exciting it's fun it's so short in momentary like by friday the whole world will have forgotten about this video but when you're in the moment it's wildly exciting how many viral videos have I had I don't know it's tough to really quantify viral but maybe five or six that are really popped now that you've got this viral video do you feel like that's the one we do that everyone's gonna know usual and it's that the video that you want everyone to know Casey when I was 22 i had a movie coming out called ipods dirty secret that did like six million views in a week before YouTube when that went viral everybody said to me you're always gonna be known as the ipod guy and then when make it count viral I was the make it count guy and when bike lanes happened I was the bike lanes guy and now i can be the snowboard guy if you only ever have one movie that goes huge yes that will be your identity forever as long as you keep changing it up you can you can overcome it but if I were only known for one movie is that such a bad thing like I'm super proud of that movie so hey Casey you've had a couple of viral videos before what's the one different thing you want to get out of this is the first video and have that's really exploded since i started blogging I've been getting a lot of from a lot of people since i started blogging because people say we miss your old videos why aren't you making viral videos anymore I don't know for me this movie says it like yes i can blog and make sure movies what is spread so you think about your viral videos she doesn't like them as much as she likes her cartoons what was the hardest part about making it between like the idea in the actual movie there are a million obstructions in overcoming all those obstructions and releasing the video that is always the hardest part and when you're dealing with like the weather and all these myriad other variables overcoming them is always the biggest challenge kk see where did you find time to watch youtube videos it seems like you're always running working spending time with whenever I get stuck and I like I'm struggling with the edit i watch a video sometimes a piece of the video sometimes a whole video that was just like watch another YouTube video and that that get things moving lately I've been watching a lot of pretty pie Casey when you fill in these videos is a scary i'm not entirely sure what you mean by is it scary but the answer is yes it's always scary because you have no idea how anyone's going to react to making something no matter how much stuff can put out there it still stings when someone doesn't like something that you worked hard on so yeah that's scary I think the key is like not succumbing to those fears or concerns or like really who gives it if it goes viral if you think it's great awesome you succeeded maybe you notice that all of today's questions were from young ladies every question I get is from like a 13 year old boy and sometimes it's nice to have a little gender diversity in there yeah so the question was asked the most is how do you make a viral movie here's a quick recipe the technique first need to do these things zeitgeist make sure it's of the now time it if you're too late no one cares if you're too early no one knows what you're talking about fresh if you're doing something that a million people have already done chances are it's not going to catch on is your message clear like is it something that everyone is going to get is it so esoteric nobody's going to give it step 1 have you accomplished all of these things this isn't everything but have you accomplished all of these things if the answer is no not viral is it a totally fucking kick-ass video that people actually want to watch if the answer is no it's not going to go viral if the answer is yes then you've touched on everything i know about how to make a viral video but even so the video will probably not be viral because the truth is I have no idea how or why the video goes viral so if you can figure out this little question mark right here then you my friend are a god and you should be making videos for a living because you can okay i hope you enjoyed this I hope that was a thorough enough explanation for you yeah I've got lucky and had a few like big viral hits beyond this just the snowboarding work but I've also uploaded 310 movies and last theater and five days so it's like two of them are one of them is gone viral that's less than one-third of one percent of every movie I make so I don't know what this and there are so many good shows on Netflix are you sure you want to watch making a murder what's up right shooting yeah no sorry",

morning special cast then Brown lets you move about seven and a half miles out and had a little bit of a crisis and needed to use the little boy's room but you know other than that great run so far you okay I was like my worst nightmare I was worried about you in there that you really going to take you back home it's going ok yeah you think consistency is important like schedule life routine like in life do you think that's important I haven't had any consistency in a really long time last week was big console is gone the entire week and then tomorrow I'm going on another trip I don't like I woke up this morning in my own bed and I took friend scene out of the crib and I realize how much I cherish just being in one place i am the luckiest guy in the world for all these amazing opportunities I have to travel and meet people and and I wouldn't trade that for anything but i do want to start working harder to have a little bit more consistency in my life mainly with family I just want to be around my family more I have not given an update on the studio renovations in a while let me bring you up to speed first I just want to say how hugely embarrassing it is this is taken like months and months and months like four years ago I built this entire studio from the ground up in like five days and this is like through many months in and like progress is slow and that's just what happens when something is not your number one priority and look I love this studio but it's just not my number one priority I got like family and work and videos and family and then I've got to make my video good life rule is never make excuses because no one gives a shit so kind of start to like what is this space for in this space is to be a place for all of my gear all my quit so it's ready and easily accessible groans take up a lot of space they've got a lot of parts so we did this whole area so that would be like a desk where I can assemble drones and put the pieces grown bags down here to put the drones in and all that what remains over here is like a power stations all the drone battery can be charged at all times but we don't organize all the blades that goes beyond just a coffee top and again I need a drawing i should just come in here grab it ready to go camera bodies lenses video camera's batteries all the camera stuff I have so many I use them all for different purposes so this wall is supposed to be like where they are easy ready to grab ready to go and it's getting there it's not right not perfect it's definitely not done but it's getting there at the point shoot lenses SLR camera cemetery up here these are all my old cameras or non-working cameras these all broke audio setup again this isn't right but it's almost right I want to know what microphones I have which ones are ready and which ones I need to grab at any given time the girl Pro area i really don't like it over here i want to move it over with the other cameras but the idea with the GoPro area is that have all my GoPros out know that they're all charge of all the GoPro accessories ready to go and just know at a glance where I stand with GoPros so that's where things stand thank you for bearing with me I can promise you an amazing glorious video of the new studio when it's done which is currently scheduled for q4 2018 that was a joke it will definitely be done before them hi honey can I come hang out with you or do something with you know about hot white party should come the for so we'll hang out for half an hour yeah okay what should we do okay copy that

            "subtitles": "there has been a huge amount of conversation online about YouTube d monetizing videos that is determining some videos to not be monetized to the creator's don't in the Adsense revenue from that video hashtag youtube party is over was trending on Twitter a lot of big-name youtubers have come forward with really disparaging stories about how some of their videos have been democratized they weren't aware of it and they're losing all this money yesterday's video and most likely many in the near future will not be monetizable here on YouTube now this is an incredibly complicated thing if you want to understand all the detail and nuance i will link below some really smart pieces about it one in particular from the internet creators killed an organization that I'm a part of that explains this in vivid detail this video's not going to explain it's just my opinion on it but here's sort of a very loose overview if YouTube determines your video to be not advertiser friendly it pulls all monetization so you don't make any money from that video that sort of almost kind of makes sense where it doesn't make sense in just how nebulous the terms are that define what advertiser friendly is YouTube uses language like excessive violence or excessive swearing very loose terms like that and even scarier there are human beings that work for YouTube determining this one's good and this one's bad it's all algorithmically filtered so it's that algorithm determining whether or not you're able to make revenue from your videos now i am an unapologetic youtube fanboy i absolutely love youtube I credit the majority of the success of my career to youtube I travel the world to speak to people about how much i love you too i'm going to australia this week to speak for you to about why i love you too and it is that admiration for the platform that gives me such distress about this issue video is where all of media is headed right now there is no more valuable piece of property or entity than video in the world of media at all in Facebook's last quarterly earnings call Sheryl Sandberg said the word video like this d times twitter is pushing harder than ever to grow their video presence amazon is paying individual creators suppose they're content their netflix is kicking cables ass everything is changing right now in the power is going from these big traditional entities to the individual creator so now as long as that intellectual property as long as that video is the product individual creators can put it wherever they wanted to go whether that's facebook or twitter which just offered a 70-percent rev share with creators the choice is purely in the hands of the Creator now what YouTube has in this space that no one else has facebook struggling to figure this out no one else has it like YouTube has it is this sense of community this kinship with creators like me and the platform that is YouTube that one issues like this come up and they're not well defined or well communicated or communicated at all buy YouTube the people affects the most like me that's where the problem lies it's not that they're doing this i agree with you $PERCENT to about most of the policing they're doing there's so much negativity and vitriol and just horrible it posted to YouTube every day that they need to police it somehow to keep the platform growing and whole and attractive to advertisers which is their business which benefits us the creator's I get it but when they don't communicate it and that lack of communication effects creators affects them in their most sensitive place which is in the wallet is a very very dangerous game I want to end this by sharing my perspective on both sides of the coin youtube I get it there's more garbage being posted to youtube now than ever before garbage that manipulates the algorithm to gain views to earn dollars for crap you have to protect your business by protecting advertiser's from that garbage but for us creators will t is a very delicate thing here most youtubers wanted minute but youtube channel is a business and the minute that business can't make money because of something that you're deciding the loyalty becomes very frail and as these other competitors are encroaching as aggressively as they are the options for us creators are myriad so protect what it is that you have that no one else has your unfair competitive advantage is your sense of community and that loyalty that is currently held by most youtubers the way you do that is by open lines of communication and making things abundantly clear not just for youtubers with millions of subscribers but for everyone every aspiring creator that wants to build a channel and a business and maybe one day make a dollar off of their creations it's up to you to make them feel good and safe about that alright that's it that's all I have to say I wrecked my youtube notebook to make this video",

sucker see this see this this is the jacket this is a sweater I haven't seen these guys since may this is a ravine smoothie it's Monday which means I'm once again healthy yeah really sorry about this vignette been getting is see these but I can do this better see these black marks at the corner there there and there that's called vignette includes thats from this lens doesn't belong here i borrow this lens my friends I know last couple days have looked weird because of back in the office that switch lenses back ready 321 looks better right no more of in getting this is what the lens look like that i borrowed I mean it's still save the day but it's not let me return it thank you thank you you saved me how to do this weekend that's great is awesome but a good time I don't want your recaps yeah did you see any more of Oscars video I don't see any more of it but it's great it's fun and others said it before I'll say it again i just love the people in this building that was John he makes videos he loved me that lens do you do you know what a press embargo is in journalism and public relations a present Bargo is a request by a source that the news provided is not published until a certain date you know something but you can't talk about it okay in this box is this totally in this box is something totally new it's a drone and it's the it's the latest and greatest you supposed to put in your pocket got a 4k camera I'm not allowed to talk about it we're open that but well I guess I could open the box i couldn't show you until october $YEAR 18 so far this press embargo sucks in other news my airplane seat movie it's about to cross 20 million views 20 million that's insane nobody has been up for seven days 20 million views in seven days that's like five million views a day I know it's not final but that also means which is not is that is now the second most watched movie of all the 650 videos or whatever on my youtube channel so i want to take one second and talk about viral videos so i have touched on this before in this channel but it's a popular subject especially relevant since I just had like a wild viral video viral videos viral videos are almost impossible to predict their greens about the shot watch already watched sumo green writing the eyeball boom dad viral videos are almost impossible to manufacture to actually create now the flip side of that is that nothing can do for a youtube channel what a viral video can do for youtube channel bike lanes which was like my first really viral video on this channel it blew my channel up in the seven days in several East this 20 million view banger i've got almost a half a million new subscribers viral videos are hugely powerful and that's why people are is pursuing them all right why did this one go viral pouring it into this and say this is why I think this particular video went viral not a recipe for viral videos in general abroad abbreviated examination of y21 thousand-dollar first-class airplane seat went viral number-one zeitgeist right now like this idea of opulence and indulgence and over-the-top miss creates a climate where a title that says 21 thousand-dollar airplane seat that's interesting . compelling what kind of a world we live in where a one-way airplane seat cost twice as much as the worldwide median household income timing there's a lot of bad news right now there's this us election which is a mess there's the conflicts taking place in the Middle East in Syria there's global terrorism there's Isis there's all these just terrible things dominating the news cycle and when something fun and harmless and playful and interesting and sort of newsworthy pops up everybody just jumped on it general this is something like a fancy airplane t the whole world is interested in this was written about in south korea and easy and in and in New Zealand it was written about in Canada it was written about in Saudi Arabia this stupid story about the airplane seat was general and up to appeal to most of the world which is a nice segue into the last factor in oculus it was perfectly innocuous there was nothing offensive or harmful or bad about that video at all which when it was safe for all the press outlets and soccer moms that posted on Facebook and shared over there no swear words there's nothing gross there's nothing yucky there is nothing offensive about that too anyone when you combine all those factors would like a little bit of funny and interesting well-told story and then a lot of bit of luck that's how that viral video came to be yeah what about her feel good being pregnant if you doing the whole foods now groceries are expensive tonight here in the united states of america is the first-ever presidential election no first-ever what

like pursue what was nothing more than like an idealistic whimsical naive ambition to become like a filmmaker an artist her to do my own thing paper cut ah a paper cut and it was both of those decision points to to move to New York City and then to quit my job neither of them were rational both of them were purely based on what i would now described as like a blinding ambition meaning all I could see was what i wanted to do in my life and my dreams in my pursuit and all of that and that blinded me from seeing what a terrible idea it was to move to New York City what a terrible idea was to quit my job fear I think fear is always the biggest inhibitor had I really spent too much time focusing on the pragmatic instead of like the dream or the whimsy of it i think i would have been way too scared to actually make the leap into the swimming pool that led to my career yeah Oh yes I hope that makes sense I just when you're young and trying to figure these things out people are always telling me advice none of it ever made sense and then when you get old like me it all starts to come together hurt myself I feel like it's almost time and I think it's time it's I mean everybody's bailing out that matter the time no I want my mom to see me actually working at this for a minute if Matt's mom shows up and we're playing video games we should at least get ready I think so yeah yeah bye guys have a good extended weekend and thanksgiving every day feeling that was the first time in a very long time that we've done something at being other than just work it was nice to spend a little bit of time with the guys like actually doing something fun we push the big update out on being yesterday they're like profiles now we're slowly inching closer to having like a feature complete product which is very excited it's nice to like have a little decompress all right happy thanksgiving yeah yeah",

drones you're in the air enough shenanigans it's Tuesday okay see what do you think free time so much I don't hate free time at all i love free time I just hate free time I envision a moment in my life where I have nothing but free time but I'm not like a point in my life right now where there's so much opportunity in front of me I'm like still young ish my career is going well and YouTube and videos in business and work and family there's so much going on that right now for me to embrace free time and Nothingness would be for me to like squander some of that opportunity opportunity that will always be there so I appreciate I love free time but when there's opportunity in front of you I feel an obligation to embrace that opportunity and I'll get two free time later in life when it's more of a priority when do you expect the renovation of your studio to be done it's going slow very slowly I need to devote more time and energy to making it happen I want it done like yesterday but i made like no progress just a huge mess kk c I wanted to ask you whether you win call yourself an introvert or extrovert umm Mohammed this is a blog where i share my entire life with the world I'm an extrovert do you know exactly how much footage to shoot in a day to make the editing process with a smooth what do you shoot a lot I always know when I'd like got a complete blog right now I painted my drone and not answer three questions I don't have a complete blog I know when I feel like I've got enough material and I've captured enough of my experience to share the video and I know when I haven't but the nuance the specifics like exactly the right amount of footage and shots in this I have no idea and there have been times i've sat down to edit the vlog and like it's just not there those are usually the ones were like late at night i'm talking to the camera for my apartment thoughts on Kanye's new album this should make the comment section fun I'm a big fan of Kanye's music this album to me felt a little bit unfinished also check out this picture of me and Kanye hello Oh Bo Bo Bo oh don't look like that's friends in your blogger almost never seen cooking do you always eat out the answer is yes I always eat out and not like fancy places just like crappy take out whatever I never cook I don't even know if my stove in my apartment turns on I spent the first five years of my career in a kitchen I was a dishwasher as a cook as a prep cook as a line cook and during that time I like fantasize doing anything with my life but having to touch and handle food I have a great appreciation for cooking I love lucky charms but I do you think Ted Cruz in the zodiac killer well I think it's a great question and it deserves an inquiry what's the best alternative to final cut pro that's less expensive use iMovie it's free are you coming to Amsterdam yeah I think Candice and I will be there in april or may how do I overcome fears or phobias you can either confront them or run from them both of those will sort of mitigate the fear where's the best place in New York City to take timelapses go to Long Island City it is the best view of the like Midtown sky ride across the river what type of blood you have that's a weird question how far should you go to get the body you want that sounds like an infomercial Achmed ah I don't know I like to run to stay healthy I don't like I mean I think I look good in a bit in soup that's not why I do it in Francine walk yet no but she's great on a skateboard hey Casey just wondering if you don't have been offered the opportunity to work to do piece like a major Hollywood film or if you were off it would you ever take me the opportunity I don't know what do p means that mean director yeah I've had that opportunity I'm not interested in making a feature film I produce two features are all too familiar with the process for me film film making my favorite part is the sharing part is the actual showing it to an audience with youtube I can make a movie every single day call it a blog called a video caller the hell you want to call it it's a piece of content that originated in my brain that manifested in the form of moving images and it was distributed to an audience so however you characterize that that's what I love that process to me it makes no difference whether shot on celluloid and projected in the theater where people watching on their iphones yes I've been offered a number of films no not super interested in it maybe that can be my retirement plan okay I have to go I've got a meeting right now I'm in the middle of Broadway in the middle of the street literally in the middle of traffic sitting in the middle of Broadway where are you how you do it I have a nice day sir I'm walking into a meeting

there was like the sign outside of the Hong Kong mcdonalds advertising like a purple apple pie and that's how we came up with the idea to make the first McDonald's video it takes a little bit like children it pays that's how we did it yeah and then we expanded on the series last year so what we're doing here we are literally driving all the way to London to have the perfect lobster roll and then we're going to go to McDonald's and have their lobster roll which I'm skeptical of what I approached with an open mind I haven't had it since 1995 oh you had it before have had it once before 1995 is it not not so memorable we're almost there you're almost there Scott's dead ahead I don't have this place is always so crowded it's almost impossible to find in the side yard on this secret alleyway here here it is the home of the world created a lobster roll the actual review of the mcdonalds lobster roll versus the greatest lobster on the world it's gonna be a short movie so this is like the behind the scenes you just got here we need a couple lobster rolls we're going to make sure they're delicious spent yesterday stretching out my stomach by drinking copious amounts of what how many lobster rolls are going to eat figure 3 or 4 let's go the great french fries here very cool ha noi stirs fried clams it's like is morning right now this is breakfast hi so what so we're too cold lobster rolls one hot logs role what else do you all take you wherever you want to take it man i'm feeling crazy right fried oysters okay all right it's a that you think that's enough food for two people at 11am ok yeah alright so we're going to get some tartar sauce and some napkins Oscar and then we're struggling here we're trying to get the shots before we eat the lobster rolls but we want to do is eat the lobster rolls I'm doing better than ask that Oscar is that waiting like this is a lot we just deconstruct their lobster roll here at scotts and it's got 201 grams of Lodge meeting that I think it fit for set up shop this week you think them yeah I think so what's missing I don't know what it tastes like to eat magic with this is gotta be close so how would you describe the lobster roll here it's got very good you want to make it worth it to come all the way out here so we've we've now consumed three lobster rolls french fries one order of fried oysters for coleslaw's and lobster best so we're going to work up an appetite on our way to nature kicked out naughty when we go to make dolls do you think they'll let us go into the kitchen to the office they're lot's of luck I don't find anything hi Maddie I think all right we're out of here back on the freeway yeah see it is here oh yeah he's here unscheduled stop at my dad's property shop because I would be a horrible person to come all the way out here not say how to old then we should be happy to see you Oscar board hey Dad I didn't bring your granddaughter but I brought Oscar all right Thank You Bailey in class but Dad what are your predictions on the cauliflower I'm not a mcdonalds fan so I would have a negative of negative feeling about whatever they're doing with lobster rolls hospital oh man that tyray out here hi Harry you're absolutely right or wrong it's just a spectator this your video for silly according to advertising bye dad oh you gotta go thanks bear we're stopping at the mcdonalds on the freeway because I well it's just the most convenient I just want to get back to New York now the ambience here is slightly different from Scotts lobster doc a little bit more concrete a little bit less water before we go in expectations low how to once when I was seven years old made my parents by a for me it was disgusting it's a treat it's something to be savored right close to the ocean the highway I just don't trust that it's something that you can make the way these guys make their food I'm going there it is I remain skeptical all right I got to make it clear to hold us over lots of rules will be up soon you know what lobster looks like and I know it's not the first thing i noticed with the mcdonalds lobster roll is there's a tremendous amount of lobster meat in here the total lobster meat on the new clots rolls 82 grams we get to your child and trying to describe it all day this is not good it tastes like something that's trying to taste like something else and that something else is a lobster roll and will actually tastes like it's just not leaving work yeah wait a minute you see our mcdonalds burger video $12 you had four patties jalapenos Swiss cheese of the words I've ever met anyone that such a fan of that video hey nice to meet you guys I don't want it I was like wait a second take it what I'm doing something wrong alright guys i'm a fan take care let's give another closer if I had to assign a number to it i would say if Scott's is a perfect 10 this lobster roll is it give it to me are you gonna finish yours no I'm just cleaning up here that was really disappointing I wanted to say something redeeming about it i didn't have anything to say so that's how we made our lobster mcdonalds the clouds to review click the link below to watch that video if you haven't actually seen the review video yet also we want to keep our mcdonalds thing alive so if you know of like funny things are anything with Donald says around the world that we should review let us know in the comments below and for anything yeah it's like carrying a newborn baby",

family trip out out to Brooklyn over the Brooklyn Bridge they have an agenda or just head towards numba what Brooklyn Bridge is going to Brooklyn yes this traffic you going home something I have been looking around online and every time I open up a floor plan it's like one tiny closet the size of Francine's or ready to go out that's special little guy we never ever come out to Brooklyn but we thought this would be a nice change for a family afternoon my second time in two days but I said we like as a family we never come to brooklyn being like this is like I think we do are a lot of people we decided on pizza it was my whole school like little bit of air that's coming through with the velcro is finger service and your mitts yeah we tried to do something different try to come out to Brooklyn Bridge so cold right now i cant told you that night I just wanted I don't know I just I thought this would be a special day for us you're special the horrible idea but we're giving up for going back to Manhattan want to see the Brooklyn Bridge today is the 300 blog I was gonna do something special for number three hundred but the more I thought about it you know you celebrate your 18 through 21st birthday but by the time 26 rolls around it's like okay you made it this far now what well that is exactly how i feel about vlog 300 100 was like this huge big deal like wow I can't believe I made it here even 200 was like wow i did a hundred twice but three hundred just means like now I am officially a blogger there are no if ands or buts about it and the question that remains is what now and I don't have an answer I don't know I want to keep doing this i want to keep the daily uploads going but I definitely feel like comforts here's the data me and I don't want to be comfortable like okay my daily upload that it I need something more i need something different and I i haven't nailed what that is for us to share our will I'll figure something out I don't it'll be something dramatic but i do want to shift things a little bit like incremental e if you're not constantly evolving your craft then what's the point in doing it anyways I never want to be comfortable i never want to feel safe that is the fast track to being irrelevant I want to keep it fresh I want to mix it up and i will be doing that that's what 2016 is about this is like your guard to protect the camera last week I put on these prop guards here and reinforced carbon fiber blades I'm trying to just Casey prove this this drone I'm waiting for a friend to show up more quickly test the drone the reason why i put these guards in place is so i can fly it here in the studio not have to worry about it hitting things but these are heavier and this guard add some additional weight I want to make sure it still flies with the same amount of control yeah hmm controlling this needs to be like an extension of my body and it's not I gotta practice this thing more I mean that was a successful run but it did have a few bumps they're definitely like they're so sharp and broken any new ones I'll figure this out you're good with drones how do you do it I just don't crash it that's it that's the rule just don't crash it you'll be all right how do you not crashing whatever not crash it if you fly in a hallway I'm like it why crashes we do it it's up for starters you recommend not to open space is good but jesse is here in town for a couple weeks I think we're going to dinner right now i just ate pizza but i'm going to dinner with Jesse anyways some sport I just you think you're gonna be warm enough how in hell do you don't go to love it is free oh i think i have a ski mask here somewhere let me see this is getting my cold weather outfit Jesse's is equally awesome her did you look like it you look amazing you know you look what the hell did we got a terrifying we go flying vile it's so cold outside you're right back there Jeffy good to see you man good talk to your brother site for the future later Jesse it's gonna be good don't hit by car don't freeze to death later Jesse to see that guy get to hang out really positive conversation I gotta go I gotta go to bed and so sorry

one person there but somebody thought we knew somebody else they just let us hang out and we end up sleeping in the apartment but come look at this ok this is how the night started that's Oscar

right there that's owned that land is that this is dad any home now baby going down for a nap I'd love to get into the studio into a little bit of renovation today way easier to work in there on the weekends with a copy made I really want the theme of my new desk to be all about surveillance app an optic on that is an optic on it was a prison design we're in one guard from one position could see all of the cells one guard to monitor the entire prison ok just stick a pin in that I want to have like 10 monitors show me ten different perspectives on the environment around my office at all times so for my new desk here i want this entire wall just to be filled with monitors now it's like a little bit crazy but mostly it's like when I'm here working at my desk and i'm editing and I'm trying to focus when I hear noises like someone knocking at the door someone buzzing the door downstairs someone walking through the hallway I'm really susceptible to distraction and I'm like what is that if i can just look up and see exactly what it is distraction over back to work so it's like ninety-eight percent me just being like a psychopath but like two percent actually like a pragmatic thing to have all this surveillance here's where i am so far this little monitor here it's labeled 201 this is so I can see what's going on outside the 201 entrance to this office space that monitor is connected to this hidden camera right here what's up it's not for securities I record any of it this little monitor this is labeled 202 and this is yet it's outside the 202 door this is like to throw down the street outside my office building this big one is so I can see what's going on that beam headquarters this here is actually just of the space behind me this monitor is kind of a rear view mirror co and standing there waving is actually just right here waiting what's missing from all this what I need is a really robust image of exactly what's happening outside my office building door on the sidewalk in front of the building this huge monitor is for that image this thing by the way it was like a hundred twenty dollars on amazon remember when these flat screens were like eight nine hundred bucks probably not because you're young Owens back here rifling through my stuff finding the interesting back there boy somebody said this you want to try and open it send you locked I don't know probably so i could open it I mean there are no keys here that's okay in the face yeah there weren't you no case you were fans of your movies we shot a short film called drone blender that have been chosen as an official selection at the New York City grown film festival we thought you'd appreciate the destroyed drone from our film dear billion Damien I do appreciate your ingenuity and I thank you for sending your busted busted busted drone you wish you the very best of luck at the drone film festival so here's where I'm at get the maximum quality image i'm going to be using this GoPro 3 that I have I'm gonna run this out the window and then mounted to the exterior of the building but I'm missing a really long mini USB cable to run constant power this project to be continued but whatever own has on his feet here what is that are they all set up properly thanks so people send me all kinds of weird stuff in the mail so that i play with so that i don't i'm late with all oh and places at all you just found these things well do again you gotta go faster there's no way you're doing it right now i think i'm gonna put on a parent Chinese things I man there's like a harley davidson store next door and these hoes on their harleys like ride up the sidewalk here this back road is Harley up up the sidewalk and I started screaming at him about you know i do what i kin is what I'm saying you know what I mean I'm not going to get a 40 year old man go into something that only someone you're probably pretty sure i mean i can tell the other part of this so Harley Davidson this message is for you you should take some responsibility for your company because no one in there take responsibility for the actions of your customers and that guy could have killed somebody all right back to my roller skates I set them all up there's just that missing its energy where's the scratch apartment my feet are way too no we are way too big these days these things are made for six-year-olds oh these are like rollerskates you put on your sneakers and then they make sparks but they're made for little little kid yeah yeah yeah yeah I think that's going to be a wrap for sparkling shoes they're definitely not made for adults as humans we didn't get the surveillance wall set up I didn't get the GoPro working we broke two pairs of rocket skates and what's got in a fight with a guy and Harley we locked ourselves out of the building oh and you should come help me at work more often all right time to get out of here all win a little bit you got laid off from your job",

first day at school by herself oh my god gear haven't talked about gear in awhile this entire episode you can be focused on gear if you're an interesting camera gear come back tomorrow for our regularly scheduled programming that my thesis on gear is pretty straightforward I've shared it with you a million times i always want the very best image possible so long as it doesn't get in the way of me living my life we're doing my thing now what that literally means is like this like when I walk into I walk into an airplane and I'm carrying my big blogging camera which looks like this the flight attendant says hey you can't have that there's no filming in here it gets in the way when I walk onto an airplane holding this so this is the thing they just assume that I'm a nerd who has two talking to a camera in there are other places we just can't bring a camera into I just use my cell phone that's what i mean by the best image possible as long as it doesn't get in the way the gist of this whole thesis is that this five-thousand-dollar camera is often not as good as this $1,500 camera this $59 camera is often not as cute as 500 our camera less good than this 200 our camera and this tune our camera at time is not as good as the camera on my cell phone you see when the story is king and the story is always King these things just serve this story and whatever one of these can tell your story the best is the best camera now I've said all this before why am i repeating myself today today is a very special day today is well in the world of drones about if you're a longtime viewers of this show you know how conflicted my relationship has been with drones i still use this like toy drone because of its convenience this was the only one that fit into my backpack equip the image quality on that thing is like a bad cell phone camera but this thing has been amazing it produces incredible results it looks like we've got a helicopter following me around it's not super manageable in fact this is a regular backpack and this is the pack that's meant to carry the Phantom for its kind of the only way to keep but it's like the only way to keep it safe now going back to where I started about having the gear get in the way of you telling your story i gave up on keeping that thing safe and I just take the propellers off and cream and my normal size backpack that is in part the reason why i have 127 broken ones what is the best answer to like the camera conundrum but with drones I don't know and I don't know if it's been answered yet but today gopro announced their new drone and maybe that's it Oh what can it be yeah so much more than a drug now i happen to have one right here so I thought we'd take a look just as a disclaimer this is not a commercial for or was paid for by or is an endorsement of anything for gopro they just gave me the opportunity to check out this early prototype so this this is the actual drone itself this here this is the battery fully charged battery into drone feels pretty good now the magic the drone wings actually just flip out on this so this big guy collapse it down to something far more manageable even with the propellers on there something big here that's different is the fact that instead of having a set of having a fixed camera is actually this is a GoPro on the front now I don't know what that better or if that's worse because i haven't flown this sucker yet but no just for a quick size size comparison you can see here the manageability is favors the GoPro in a big way because the cameras on the front here it means the legs could actually be smaller and pulled out in the bottom because they're not responsible for protecting the camera like here all right and this is the gimbal here this is what keeps the image totally steady symbol here gimbal here but this is what GoPro did that's totally next level ready the gimbal actually ok you turn this like this and then just slide it out the gimbals pops out you take this little guy and then you've got a handheld gimbal that gets totally study handheld footage and it's the same it's the same this is the same symbol that works with it's the same gimbal that works on the drone i can now use an attached to stuff i'm not going to pack up the drone take the gimbal skate to somewhere where I can find fly the drone and test the gimbal also I didn't show you the controller so haven't used it yet but one day I'm totally psyched about it doesn't your phone like this is the whole touch screen here controls here buttons here buttons here it's kind of like a gigantic gameboy alright thrown in backpack there this is the custom custom backpack that comes with no gonna try something right I'm going to try to skate there with this thing on with this thing on my chest alright this little guy right here it's stabilized and it's rolling it was just able to stop the entire stabilizer to my chest pretty cool yeah all right full disclosure this is the maiden flight my maiden flight probably the universe maiden flight of a girl from karma in the wild I've read no instruction manuals and I've had no instructions on this thing here's what we're dealing with here I get the nice screen of available twenty patients yes not yet obtained off i'm leveling irobot here we go you what what yeah this thing is fast yeah ok is far against is like business is like the only GoPro karma prototype on planet earth right now and I've got like a mile from me things up town okay bring it back at 21 minutes left in this flight so i think it's time to step it up a little bit and try something a little bit more complex that is the operating the drone while flying the boosted board as my first time on this thing so this will be telling all right wish me luck yeah so that's it that is the first look at the GoPro karma drone system stable that was unfinished product the software wasn't finalized so I'm gonna reserve giving you my judgment on it but i can say this it's very very exciting that that is where things are headed like in one backpack is essentially like a fork a Steadicam a helicopter with a stabilized camp like if you had told the younger version of me don't have all of that available to me in a backpack I wouldn't believe you all right full disclosure here obviously by the way I anymore after you push the red button here this is colin from GoPro he's sort of been supervising my visit today with the prototype Karma's I've been telling him like don't tell me how to use this let me figure this thing out but these are but I don't get to keep these when i get one so we said today they'll be available in October 23rd when I said I didn't get any instructions or anything I mean it when I said that I had not been given any instructions i really want to try this thing without anybody teaching me how do thank you for letting me play with it my pleasure thanks for going up we always love Sharon stop with you Casey I'm very impressive to ride a boosted board that little practice something",

because it's going to make youtube better competition makes everyone better and do you like the fact that you get heat over nothing the comment section of youtube I see is just like Twitter it is wonderful what it stands for and what it enables it's terrible and execution and that it lets people hide behind anonymity to spew hate it should be a forum for positive meaningful conversation instead it enables the trolls of this world to have another mouthpiece to spew their vitriol how often is you to reach out to you how much communication do you have with them it's nearly every single day the support that I get from youtube is incredible part of the reason why i love youtube so much do you like the title youtuber more than the title filmmaker yes I do don't shoot on film shoot on video I don't put my movies and movie theaters i put them on youtube I am only a youtuber i'm not a filmmaker and i love that distinction that is a very important distinction for me ok Candace just emailed me and said Tom visitor so I'm gonna go see Candis right now last question was reaching a hundred subscribers difficult for you yes reaching a hundred subscribers reaching hundreds of Travers way harder than reaching a thousand and then reach a thousand was way harder then reaching like a hundred thousand and retain a hundred thousand was harder than a million in without a doubt 1,000,000 was way harder to do than 3 million let me end this unit my brain is over bring it on it it's exactly like making a living in life like when I was dirt poor when I couldn't afford to feed my family and I worked two jobs in a restaurant scrubbing pots and pans that was the hardest dollar I ever had to earn what I had zero dollars and I needed to earn my first hundred that was so much harder there's a great book by Peter teal called 021 I love the book that don't endorse his political preference in that book he addresses how hard it is to start with nothing and turn it into something you start with 0 and you get to one that's the hardest thing you can do all right I got to meet Candace yeah I just wanted to share this sign with you because i really like the language it uses respect I was filming a time lapse and the farm and drop their ear protection I will return this they just fell off the truck they can appreciate that you got it now now no matter what happens today I know I did something good hi what's happening here she would have proposals yeah like to pitch in this at work are you ready to get started on next morning that will direct you you take meetings in jersey but that's what I Jack yeah plate has that gotten old yet now Tesla it's the safest car you can buy if you would love it yeah you don't Google fashion regular cars that are Tesla but I just get you a Tesla I just how did somebody not want to test them we're on an appt rework excursion to check out this new restaurant that opened on the water over there something that looks nice isn't it yeah haha failing on the restaurant baby freaked out but we tried people just reporting the Q&A and they were like 10 people are like Hawking Marlins never in the blog anymore Oh welcome a month on the blog I don't know before I see you all the time I guess I just don't get the year run yet it's a visit in",

you guys here on the bottom pick out or not make out all right in that window just to make out for that shot we interrupt our programming to bring you this important message actually this is not a super important message but i do need your help i was nominated for a youtuber of the year award at the shorty awards and I need your vote for me the link is below top link it's not that I care about winning it's just that I hate lose it so please I asked if you go below it takes like I don't know how long it takes take me for youtuber of the year now back to our normally scheduled blog I don't know how long this has been down here but I can think of a lot of places more appropriate to store a DVD recorder then under a radiator this is what happens plumbing pipe these are flanges my favorite thing to make desks out of it the entire board area needs to be relocated that's going to go in the back where the rest of the stuff is going to go this is for work that is for stuff a lot of work to do a lot of work to do but it's tuesday and consistency is everything we are wondering what are going to take friends seem to get 0 I'm actually really looking forward to taking the kids to disney world but she like can go to the grocery store now without freaking out so I don't know what she's like three how 43 something great question guys kk see this is a random question but are you a good dancer I don't think that question random at all and the answer is no my grandmother was a Rockette on Broadway a like fabulous super star dancer she taught dance her entire life I took lessons from her for seven years i never got past the baby class that's a two-year-old the five-year-old's the kids kept growing up I stayed in the same class I can do a time step though this is as good as I got time step let's see is no turn step 2 i can edit video like nobody's business but I don't have an out of rhythm in my entire body you ever think about moving to San Francisco you know I spend a lot of time in san francisco for for work but I don't think I could live there at least not now this point in my life I couldn't live there it's an amazing city though my questions about music clearances what are you doing with that you got the Frank Sinatra still up on your skiing video how do you monetize this video's when you kept are just cover well the truth is I I don't like the reason why the Frank Sinatra video is blocked a lot of countries is because i don't have permission to use that song so the label blocked in a bunch of trophies is completely out of my control and if you go back and look at all of my videos before most of my videos before i started blogging I you songs i didn't have the rights to all the ads you see those aren't mine what career choice do you want financing to pursue I says oh and I said anybody i love her care about I don't care it's whatever makes you happy if that means waiting tables if that means working with your hands as long as your work is fulfilling you're doing the right thing Casey what's with you see to some people who just a dream last night because of other terrorist systems actions and quake that's you no matter where you go in this world no matter who you talk to in this world you will always find good people and you always find bad people and that includes all races all religions all ethnicities all political everything the fact that some very narrow minded typically very dim people will associate an entire religion or entire race with something negative is tremendously is horrible it's absolutely terrible and the xenophobia that is like promoted by so many politicians in this very country is really really scary stuff and they use it as a way to get people scared when people are scared they want to act and protect themselves and build walls and go to war and do things like that which unfortunately makes for monitoring a very effective political tool and that's why we see so much of it but what do I think of what you described which I would call racism I hate it I hate it it frustrates me I'm going to end today's Q&A with a little story this is a super old picture this is my like 10 years old that's my homie warez i think i have another picture of war is back here somewhere I see this awesome guy with the tiger that that that's my friend Juarez wars is one of the first people I ever met when i moved to new york city and i met him in like it must have been October of 2001 when I met him he had two huge black eyes and he had those two black guys because he was jumped and beat up after sep tember 11 for being a Muslim now he's not a Muslim he's see what happens have a beard and a turban so some ignorant fools beat him up for no reason and when I see a great guy i mean he's an amazing guy he's like the jewelry designer and when i call them and was like I need a ring for kids this she like stopped everything and he made Candice's wedding ring for me like a custom like amazing guy he's also an amazing actor maybe you've seen him yeah that's a movie called the life aquatic with steve zissou Bill Murray directed by wes anderson amazing movie last night Flores was not let on an airplane in Mexico because of his turban aeromexico kicked me off flight over turban that's right he didn't get to fly because of his turban unbelievable now that is like well that's stupidity is what that is but that's also racism and Prejudice nuh sand and all those horrible things that that someone like Juarez despite how handsome he is because of his traditions he didn't get to fly that is insane I can't tell you how frustrating that is yeah yeah the doorbell just rang and it was a gigantic box of organic box of cookies with a note whoo fresh cases so that you're redoing your office i can help you i live in new york and construction background this is why I such a positive outlook on the world even those things like that happen my friend Juarez the world is filled up with mostly good people yeah that still needs to be leveled and properly put in place but not a bad start for day one I have to get back to work now so construction will resume tomorrow ok is it from there",

about Clint Eastwood the guy knows how to tell a story and I do think Tom Hanks is one of the greatest actors right he's unbelievable what you disagree he really is that good that's two thumbs you that your yeah that's two thumbs up for pick up a pickup shot in movie making a pickup shot is when you need to get another shot are you missed a shot see if you're back at a later date and shoot a pickup shot that video that I shot yesterday with my friend Carly we have to shoot a pickup shot tonight it's now seven o'clock and i'm leaving the house to go like to go work yeah it's only at the end of this summer when you get these purple sunsets like this also for what it's worth the 10 this this building right here is brand-new in the penthouse the top floor cost 50 million dollars Candace showed me on the Internet yeah yeah youtube yeah it's a location take care i'm meeting up with the production team first I think I'm meeting them here and then when you shoot the scene it's a quick scene but it's like once you get all the balls moving everybody in the right light ends up taking two hours and I know it's going to take tonight yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah no surprise at all it's very simple like five second shot is vastly more complicated than we anticipated Brett is like building a light out of it binder kind of a binder and a flashlight that work it works keep getting yelled at by security gonna get the shot but it's like the most simple shot it's the most complicated thing together points bread so we gotta be johnny-on-the-spot quick with this growing you take or two before they will tell us we can't shoot here that looks great pull it back just a little bit further off the binder and if you use it there you go just like that yeah all right we got the shot at the hotel but only with security like yelling is over and over and over again that permission to shoot there was mostly on the sides you ever follow the rules I just think permission comes you up so much what were you like in grade school did you and troubles so now that you have models ya know now but this is it i'm just driving with you right now for moral support thank you yeah this is a rapper to leave

motivation what's up i'm not going to see you one of these toys right here you have one full of at equality really yeah and I would you know that any one of these look at this will you bring anything

dollars isn't cool no it's cool a billion dollars that's right a billion my youtube channel just crossed 1 billion views 1 000 000 000 1 billion now I don't know really what or if that means anything but I just remember years ago reading the New York Times an article titled the girl with a billion views it was about youtuber jennamarbles by Jenna and how she had accrued 1 billion views and when I read that I was like my god that is an infallible number there are only 300 million people in the United States of America there are only seven billion people on the entire planet in this one young lady via our YouTube to have 1 billion views in today I cross that threshold thank you all 1 billion of you or 100 of you who have each watch 10 million views or 1000 of you who have each watch 1 million views 1 million of you who have each watched thank you today I want to do a special 1,000,000,000 view Q&A have another Q&A in a while getting a lot of requests for it so here we go Gina what single video made the most impact in terms of those 1,000,000,000 ok the most impactful video from use a movie i made called bike lanes wait right there bike lanes was the first movie I made when I started my own YouTube channel that truly went viral on YouTube demonstrated to me the power of YouTube this one video in two days did more views than my entire HBO series did for the life of the show and that blew my mind that affirmed my thinking that YouTube was where I wanted to direct my focus for the future do you think you can achieve a billion views this fast without the vlog no chance there's just no way that you can get those kind of numbers without uploading a lot of content what video you the most proud of and the most part of a movie called my kidding me it's this like 22 minute epic i made about Owen John Barnes what's your biggest advice for filmmakers on 13 years old don't waste your time with film school we are a place right now in this genre where you can buy a camera or you can use your cell phone to make videos that will reach tens of thousands or millions or hundreds of millions of people you don't need the formalities of filmmaking that they teach in school instead take the money that your parents or you or you would borrow to go to film school take that money and spend it on living life this is very much like Vernon Hertzog theory around filmmaking spend that money spend those resources on experiences his filmmaking is not about the craft it's not about the camera's not about the gear it's about telling stories and sharing experiences and sharing perspectives and if you're only perspectives in life are the ones your professor taught you in film school you're gonna have a really tough time making something people care about i am very much pro academia i am my kids in college right now and I could not be more proud of him it is film school that I take issue with no one can teach you how to be a storyteller you have to live to be able to do that how are you celebrating I'm not I'm not celebrating I'm making this video and i'm just putting my head down and making more videos i believe in like benchmarks and I'm proud of 1 billion but with each successful comes a bigger more ambitious with each success comes a bigger and more ambitious goal and this success just motivates needed to do more do more YouTube do more in life create more make more reach more people last questions I think it's romantic how much credit do you get Candace on those 1 billion views about 950 million of those 1 billion views i got after I married Candace having a support system like a family is absolutely instrumental in keeping focus and working hard and everything that contributes to your success to my success yeah I mean don't tell her i said this right credit canvas would like all of my success but don't tell her I said thanks to go straight to her head honey I've got that what I was riding my skateboard really slowly and I was going to a pothole and I crash I've the Rolex why do my father can hello I Stanley so how's everything going I just cool to say hello so what do we do about this thing to relax i understand there's no

door i was outside time for school now working know what are you doing that you couldn't happen i have a very fun morning today so on the only to a press event right now like to have a bunch of members the media there and then out something important this press event is for one of my favorite companies yeah now I know there are now two drone today but i don't know what is inside of your right hand side and you lock up on that casey matt was for community is it to thank you very much the event hasn't actually begin yet they gotta punch it groans over here but stuff we've already seen a lot of industry folks here some members of the media free coffee but no snacks i'm not gonna make a big deal out of it but there are no snacks I mean it's not that big deal Wow hey Casey what's up dude if I had we like a high it's good to see you it's good to see you as well maybe one controlling let's thrown together i'll be so much fun this is about to pop off launch event will commence shortly but now i'm excited to tell you that that technology can effortlessly did in this backpack that's actually not got back I like to just to rely on me so I'm simply going to tap to take off why Wow DJ I just launched everything I've ever wanted in a drone maybe first off you a comprehensive review ok now for the comprehensive review pretty cool full disclosure as always I'm not hired i'm not being paid by DJ I to make this video is not an endorsement or an advertisement for their product if it sucks i'll tell you it sucks alright so this is it this is the drone with a battery put it fully extended but where it gets interesting is what happens when you fold this thing up this is the entire drone right here this is it this is the whole thing it's tiny maybe it might even it literally fit can you see that it literally fits in my pocket this is the drone now despite the fact that it fits into my pocket which makes me feel like I'm living in the future it I it doesn't feel like a toy it doesn't feel plastic it doesn't feel cheap this feels more like a transformer like a Michael Bay movie prop heavy solid secure mentally not cheap or light or plasticky that one thing that's super cool about this is that you never have to take the propellers off see this is what they look like you even have to spread them apart like that the centripetal force once this thing starts spinning aligned perfectly on the Phantom for that was one of the you always have to click them on or clip them all top two arms folded out like this and then these bottom two arms they fold down like this it's a the design feels nothing short of just genius I'm telling you like a transformer from the future also even though the DJI phantom 4 is my main drone this thing is a joke and I've told them that I don't really understand the wind holds onto your phone is like feels like it was tacked on it it feels way way bigger than it needs to be it's just not a very ergonomic were like practical controller I don't understand why this thing needs to be show cute look at this controller is the same size of this trip but the new controller that this thing the last hardware comparison i want to do before i start playing with this thing is comparing it to the Phantom for this is the mattock and this is the Phantom 4 I mean the size differences astonish it alright this is like the stupidest thing to do but well I've never flown a drone in this studio that either getting hurt or breaking the drone but they really went on and on about how this thing can fly well indoors so I'm going to give it like a a quick dry yeah wow there's no GPS in here and he's just start the controller are you seeing this look at cgi it's just staying there in perfect position it's a miracle God is out region yeah yeah oh hi that was highly impressive it just went up in state in the exact position so how these things work outdoors is they use a satellite GPS to nowhere to stay but when they're indoors there are no satellites it's just like.how okie dokie time for some real-world test here now first of all no backpack carried in this little pouch thing which honestly is an official DJ I pouch but i'll never use this pouch again doesn't need all this extra like Patti and fluff now the setup arm out arm out arm down arm down drone down alright powering up ok shits on controllers on never connect calibrate calibrate this is always such a buzzkill ok here we go ready to fly eat somebody help me fill you some help so they were about you in trouble well this is a different here it's more deserted out here so the cops will come out here to bother you there Sean head in it might help your film yet let's do this the first boy to the DJI Matic pro in the wild not my office yeah it's gone Wow feels good so far where is it ok the control feels really responsive actually prefer this controller to the phantom 4 controller i feel like i've got much more precision control the image is more narrow than it is on a phantom-like it's not as wide like the GoPro is which is I like the wide angle but i'm sure we have a better image it's far from me right now it's very far and it is handling this like a champ alright I got a warning and said hi wind velocity this thing's tiny how it can handle this wind i don't know if the image if the image that when i look at my computer if it's if it's seventy-five percent as good as the phantom 4 i'll never use the phantom 4 again got stuff just nice having this tool display because then the phone becomes a monitor and up here becomes all the critical battle is an extremely complicated maneuvers feel the wind here the wind i'm going to try to land in the wind see the win with he has studied it in our now you landed yeah haha haha so psyched about it being there no wow but this review for this thing is that if the video that I'm about it the video that's all this is even close to what the phantom 4 look like this will be my new favorite drone and what I think is the best phone i've ever seen No yeah that might be the coolest piece of camera equipment i'd ever use I want to address the skeleton and apply within the GoPro karma vs DJ I mavet I haven't had much time with the GoPro so i have no the form of firm opinion on it but I with the GoPro karma is not just a drone it's an entire system with the hand so I don't think it's apples to oranges but they're definitely playing in st. playing the same problem in the same pool soon they both exist in the same world so will be interesting",

Nick Brock you ask when are you going to reveal the new company how about right now ok very happy to announce the name of the new company is beam henceforth I will no longer refer to the new company as the new company i'll only refer to it as beam ok little explanation the reason why I haven't been able to tell you the name of the company is because we've been like fighting and fighting to get the URL the web address b.com which we got but I couldn't say the name of the company until we had it because there's a lot of jerks out there that might try to buy the URL out from under us and like and that would cause a whole bunch of headaches for us so thank you for your patience I apologize for taking so long I hope it makes sense that i had to get the web address before i could say the name Bheem Bheem the name of the company i'm going to say beam as much as humanly possible so being sticks because new company really stuck and I have to change that habit also we're trying to get the twitter handle being app which we got so now we have a team . com we have been app on Twitter we're good more very very soon about beam theme ok next question how do you start to be a filmmaker you just start there is no process you just start and it takes a long time to learn but really the only way to get there is just start it's like anything else you want to learn how to play basketball you pick up the ball you want to be a filmmaker you just pick up whatever camera you have probably your phone and just start overthinking the process will kill any career in the creative space you just have to do not think do you budget your money Elena I'm really embarrassed to say that I'm terrible absolutely terrible with money I'm not proud of that and I'm working hard to get more responsible especially with like on going to college next year I've been saving for a decade for his college fund and it's still not going to be anywhere near enough I want to be better with money coconuts yeah

had to fix it and growing up in an environment like that you're forced to be and I love hanging on to the craft of making things Kyle asks what are your motivations to get up in the morning I don't know i'm i'm always in a crazy rush to get my day started laying in bed is stagnation it's like i'm not i'm not doing anything so there's always a real urgency for me to get up get out and start the day what's your best advice for young relationships Chad asks when the app is launched what comes next let me know what comes next is actually building out the company launching the app launching beam is just crossing the starting line not the finish line it's like if I can equate it to running is I'm a big runner a big marathoner it's like building this thing has been training for the marathon and when we launched its when the starter pistol goes off and you start but that still means you have the longest hardest most challenging run ahead of you that could last who knows how long okay I'm gonna stop right there because Jerome's back thank you as always for your questions for you next week I just finishing up another overprice super healthy meal that look like this I was launched from delicious and have as a lot of Rudy can put on three drinks one two three thank you sir I don't know how I can screw up my vlog two days in a row but I screwed up my blog two days in a row so all of the rest of the footage for today's vlog so all of this the microphone was off for so see all these bumpy lines here that audio then there's no audio none which really sucks so here let me just show you what happened drew and I got lost in an apartment building which is a little bit stressful than we got trapped in an elevator then we got trapped in another elevator and we called for help which didn't really work out and then went to a friend's house in and they were up for dinner and Marcus to pursue it like salads or something but they took forever to cook although in the you to cook salads and then we cross the street here up the music this and then we said goodbye I probably said like I'll see you later and then that was trying to it so i was explaining to Rome earlier today how yesterday i accidentally deleted all my footage and normally that would have been like the death sentence for a movie but because i have obliged myself to posting every day I forced myself to finish that video by using like titles and whatever I had to do to get through it and this is like another example like it's 5:15 a.m. and all i want to do is like go to bed right now but I'm committed to posting every day therefore I have to figure out some way to salvage this blog and post it I have to finish what I started so now this blog is like about like determination and commitment i will finish this blog it just probably won't be right good and for that i apologize yeah",

mean literally I can't feel my face I think that the reason why I'm always crashing my drones and like breaking all of my gear is because I don't invest any time and learning how to use it properly okay here's the plan I've got both my drones I'm not software for both Thrones that's what's to follow me it was to do what I tell it to do I brought my crappy little drone and I brought my really good enormous drone into a quick test flight to see how it performs in this wind You certainly have a problem there's no way they're going to give me a hard time on this way kids what could she possibly how you doing I believe in following the rules and not breaking the law but sometimes the rules just make no sense that why can't I find my drawing if there's anyone for like a mile in any direction she said this is private property I don't you know that means is a public park it just you know that woman who was lovely she was not a police officer she's like a park or something the Sun just went away that's not going to help my cold this we are at war right first you bring it every time I fly a drone I crash it there's nothing out here I do see the humor in this every single time there's nothing out here except for the pole right behind me and that's what I just crashed this thing I'm really good at a lot of things fly drones is not one of them now i'm gonna send up the second string here junior varsity there little guy you could do it ok that worked out really well loads yeah old man hey I got the footage not a total disaster this is exactly why I can't give up on flying a

chasing down some celebrity it was the most predatory thing I've ever seen like 10 due to huge like eh cameras are chasing this woman down the sidewalk was like jarring I'm afraid to take this camera sucks i don't want people to think that I'm one of those guys I'm not just a youtuber not some monster paparazzi would we got about 45 minutes to kill so we came up here to enjoy this outrageously amazing view of Hollywood and then the city's right there yeah in life it's very important to stop take a minute appreciate your surroundings and then go back to living making friends all of rollin

growing up so fast it's it's just been killing me like eating me from the inside killing me not seeing her so i'm racing to Texas to see that cute little munchkin and that will bring back my spirits I'm sorry if I've been gloomy at all i just like it's eating away at me I'm going to miss my flight I i I've just been sitting here for like 45 like probably not moving and get out of my car look at traffic all the way back not moving nothing's moving I brought around the block like 10 times is no other way around this is just like literally stopped traffic and everything i just checked on like every single travel site i could find there are no later plains tonight to Texas it's I make this light at seven thirty bring out 6 15 I make this light at seven thirty or I'm stuck in California for the night you no idea how much this sucks this I'm sorry see that car that car is with the wrong direction that is the right idea I'm sorry i have to subject you to this anger and hostility but

here 30 minutes the airport all right moving I'm moving this movement is very positive this is a major breakthrough and i'm back in traffic it's moving it's moving back in traffic but i'm very very close to the airport here's the thing though if I do get the airport in time I saw the return this rental car so we go straight to the airport like check and get my ticket drop my dad's all that stuff

I immediately left the office i got my bike and I just started running around the city this is Union Square yeah these were all people cheering because of who was elected for pro try to imagine that the tenor of politics today look at this excitement yeah it was just like everywhere it was people going nuts this is times square new york city remember for two thousand name and then january twentieth two thousand nine this is when they sign the president in the old president goes out the new one comes in they make everything official he stands up there ready cheers for him now look Washington DC is about 225 miles south of here so of course I zip down to DC where I rendezvous with Graham almost inauguration time been standing for 77 let's see seven straight hours my back started to hurt yeah I've never been in Washington DC before when there was a presidential inauguration happening but there were just parties everywhere and we went to all of them the same day as well about that this is a younger 26 year old Casey yeah I'm not the maniac now that I that I was that and then we knew that our tickets for the actual inauguration put us in a field where we can be at the front of for all the way in the back so we showed up at like four in the morning to be the first ones into that field guns please times throughout the year yeah this is when they finally opened the gates and DC police and Secret Service were like hold back hold back don't go just yet don't go hold on Oh Oh 00 No Oh flap ok current looking i'm happy i'm good with words John I think this is the spot spot you can see the podium and the big screen now this was just by chance but that guy over my right shoulder right there that is John Singleton the academy award nominated director of boys in the hood for back on Access Hollywood live in the wreckage on this portion of John Singleton's home video will be directed by Casey nice that you have dr. case camera notice that he he put his name on it just like he's like an eight mike is eight years old thank you had to put his name was never know kiss me we got those camera was also wearing shirts and ties grams idea you were asking why are you putting on a tie we're going to stay in the field for a whole day and he said when you're an old man and you look back at the day you were at barack obama's inauguration don't you want to see yourself wearing a shirt and tie I'm sorry no strength morning else I'm sorry that my hand is in your face I just got to get this you need to use my hand now in red you're going to do it I think after the inauguration on our way home that happen we fell asleep on the street or some we were so tired we did go out that night though the inaugural staff party jay-z performed I was super fun night and it ended with graham taking without permission a presidential seal I mean they're gonna throw it out anyway as he was leaving with this presidential seal security stopped and they're like what is that and he showed it to me and then the security guys just like you're okay have a good night please go if I had an epilogue for the story would be that in 2012 Graham my homie he actually ran for Congress my name is Graham be easy and I approve this message because you should know that there's a fresh alternative he lost but he put up a good fight before you were born I was trying to raise questions about Davis vessels so i cant open auto county would know that out there is a guy who puts actions behind his words I probably should have put this message at the beginning of this episode but save your hate from the comments this is just about me sharing an experience and to maybe underscores just how gnarly things are right now in politics can you imagine seeing that kind of excitement around this election because I can't",

want to look at like the pricing and regions page for second make sure all this the same Kate's 327 in the morning on what's the date today we are about to send beam live on the App Store globally right well we'll listen all right click it ok still alive fly that's here we are officially live in the app store I don't feel that was pretty good yeah today is a very very big day today is the day that the clothes come off today's the day I reveal every detail every aspect i show you what beam is how it works what the app looks like that's all happening now on this block yeah yeah you see social media it's supposed to be a digital or virtual version of who we are as people instead of this highly sculpted calculated calibrated version of who we are told through filters that make our eyes bluer in carefully selected images to portray a version of who we are it doesn't really resemble the reality of things my team and I we've spent the last year plus building a new version of social a new way to share one that we feel bridges that uncanny valley real life is here social media is here and we're up here this is being all of their social apps when you want to share a picture or video you go like this and instead of seeing the world with your eyes you're seeing it through your phone or they work like this where I'm staring at myself making sure to look a certain way and then I stopped recording right that's where i'm staring at myself i get to scrutinize myself that's just it i'm not sharing the real me i'm sharing a version of me with being we wanted to do something different we wanted you to be able to maintain eye contact we want to be able to keep staring at the sunset and we wanted you to keep watching the rock concert while still letting you share so this is what sharing on beam looks like there's no staring at the phone you just hold it to your chest and it records and then it's posted that's it there's no preview there's no review and there's never need to look at your phone if you want to do a selfie you just stick it against the wall talk to the phone now to accomplish this we have to do some interesting things mainly we use the proximity sensor as a record button and this is what viewing looks like on being these are all the people i follow these are all their beams and if i want to watch one you just hold down the cell is my sister once it's over the beans gone forever everything you see you see for the first time you sleep in the last time and if you want to send feedback there are no thumbs up and there are no hearts if you see something like time you just move your finger and send the real-time selfie light my mom's gonna be so mad at me what are they saying many people fighting cars like that getting reactions is my favorite part of the app there's just something so satisfied about being able to see people actually watching what you shared being able to capture without being forced to stare at your phone is one of the most liberating interactions I've done since getting this device you'll find that we have nothing but the best and most positive ambitions for this platform if you look into who i am if you look into my team is you'll see that were a collection of individuals trying to do something really positive trying to remove the self-awareness and the self-consciousness from sharing on social media so that's being I'm so psyched to finally be able to share with you exactly what it is what I've been working on what our vision is for it I'm really excited beam is in the Apple App Store today globally but i highly recommend you do not download it today we have a new version coming out next week that's much more complete and buttoned up I wait till then but i do want to talk about how you get access to be because after you download it you're still not in your locked out you can reserve a user name but you don't get access to the actual app where you can post and you can view and we did that with good purpose we did that good reason a social network is only ever is good as the users on that social network and beam in particular is a lot more fun with friends so how it works is you need to have an unlock code to unlock your beam to unlock your app and anyone who's in like me can unlock your app so what I'm going to do is I'm going to give an unlock code on this blog next week after we launched the new version and you the viewers will be the first to have access and it'll be fun it'll be like mission impossible with the password self-destructs after an hour or something so really only you the log watchers will have that first access and then you can invite your friends or wherever you want and then a community builds that way and typically when you launch apps it's all about getting as many downloads as possible but for us we much more want to focus on actually i think people use the app that want to use the app not like people who download it and then never open it again that doesn't that's not fun to the community and that's why we have that unlock mechanism there if you can unlock your friends and both of you are in it and you can share with one another and that's just a lot more fun right there's a lot more to talk about with being tomorrow's login be solely dedicated to like a beam Q&A where we can like exhaust every question you might have all right I'm like sitting a our fire escape right now which is a very dangerous place to hang out and there's some people down this she gonna be a late night family came by to say hi so I get a little love in for the night begins he likes jewelry just like your mom okay by you to buy friending sorry Francine on Candice right by our me goodbye up up up yeah yeah okay there we go",

to warn you about today's episode let me take a shower I mean I'm not saying this to discourage you from watching I think you should keep watching I just feel like as a matter of full disclosure I have to let you know before we get into the episode which are in store for don't think it's because of a lack of effort on my part that that's not it at all I work equally hard on each and every upload I just have a very strong feeling that today's episode is gonna suck New York County juror summons today today I've got jury duty the truth you can't handle the truth for those of you living outside of the united states or under the age of 18 or just don't know jury duty is this thing that happens when you're an adult where you have to go and you serve on a jury to decide if someone's innocent or guilty that's how the legal system works here so when you get jury duty you have to show up in court and if you don't do it you go to jail now this happens to be something I believe in this is like this is on Eric I think this is a just and fair system but you have no say in this schedule like I gotta go today or I'm in big trouble i'm on the penny board if they're never going to let me bring my boosted boards in there i'm also shooting on a point-and-shoot they'll never let me bring my big camera use the stairs were partying was shot and Godfather one his limo was waiting right here and bam the shot as he was running up the stair I am 100-percent sure they won't let me film in there so I'm going to put this away now alright they took away my camera but they didn't take my cell phone and they also didn't say that i couldn't didn't explicitly second film so I'm just going to very gently try to capture some of this experience while respecting the need for privacy and discretion we had a one half-hour lunch break I'm going back to the office that was not an enjoyable experience for the brief time that I was in high school I spent a lot of time in detention in detention is exactly the same thing as jury duty and i'm not talking about like the teachers not looking as we're well so we all smoke pot and then have a dance party and get locked in a closet Molly Ringwald get back to determine kind of attention I mean like detention like detention detention where you're being punished detention I feel like if I were ever in jail I'd want to be on like a chain gang come on here boss I don't they still have those because at least I could then spend my time digging ditches and but this this is like this is there's no digits to dig there's this is just like it's like purgatory you're just forced to sit there and do nothing look I really really do believe in doing my civic duty and being there but let me just explain why struggle so much with the idea of doing nothing now I wake up every day seven days a week like between 445 in five a.m. and then i go to bed between like a drum lucky 1030-11 more likely around midnight midnight 30 and every minute when i wake up at five or whatever to go to bed at midnight or whatever non-stop I'm permanently in go mode the pedal is all the way on the floor I'm going full speed ahead there's no relaxing there's no downtime there's no that it is full is just girl and my even broader perspective on life is to operate as if there's like a rabbit hungry rabid wolf would like blood dripping first thing just chasing after me all the time and the minute I slow down that wolf is just going to devour me to succeed to accomplish but what I hope to accomplish that it's really hard and there are a lot of people trying to do the same thing they're a lot smarter than you know better resources that mean more access to me in the only way i can compete is by working harder and doing more and that's why I like productivity and being official data is everything see hard work working hard is my unfair competitive advantage no matter what you have that I don't have I can always compensating please make up for that by working harder than the next guy hard work and tenacity got to keep working hard and never ever ever ever stop doing a little construction project kind of a fun story behind it he origins

sir so long I want to get back there in two days every week I think the way to keep them interesting is to keep them short not by not doing them today's Q&A you know Candace and I are on like an absolute streak of not getting into any huge Merrill fights so I thought a good subject for today's Q&A would be for us for us to talk about love and romance how do you love me I don't think you guys understand when i made like let's talk about relationships and stuff when did you know you fell in love with canvas the first time I saw in a bikini not totally true but not that quickly I like tennis from the moment I met her you know how do you pay attention to your family issue so much video on the time I don't understand like this candice never feel like you're not paying any attention totally valid question I don't shoot 24 hours in front of the camera with me always so in the moments that you see from like Mexico and you know like I pic times and it feels appropriate to have the camera with Candis she's hip to it if it's an inappropriate time she's not up i just put the camera away these videos are 10 minutes long my day is 24 hours long and it's about being responsible otherwise yeah i'm not going to be pretty destructive a channel and share and asks how do you define love I don't know but I know why I really love Candis is because I just always want to hang out with her she's like my favorite person ok here's a really sad question but i will answer it and this will be the final question that i will answer in this week's romantic you today I can't tell if this person is being serious or not being serious going to answer this question seriously of it how did the this is literally the question that's not funny it's kind of funny it's not funny the question is the question is how does one find love when they're ugly my mother-in-law kinases mom says there's a lid for every pot and what that means is like it's just about finding your match and like if a girl doesn't want to Dave if she thinks you're ugly she's definitely the wrong person for you to be pursuing there is no science and romance and love it's really like you just got to put yourself out there you know I'm so unqualified to be even talking about this i don't know why I picked this as a subject for this week the QA this week is about love and relationships like it's always all time well it's not for anything to talk about ok so why do you love me don't ask me that that's not something I can just answer and especially not on a camera okay then why when did you know that you liked me the minute you left houston to go to Paris right after we met is that love her as a tragic situation I don't see either one yeah that's fine and I was like I was just like a poor dobby nobody then -

thought my short time here KITT super high so somebody's hands in shorts to get it much much much much much better today is Monday but also the line for that after a holiday here in the states what else we didn't end nothing right walking around in order to walk around in circles are you gonna get a boozy drink this Italian family just came over and said hi took selfies with me it turns out these are the people that own manfrotto tripod look is great to meet you guys thank you I'll see you in Italy ok bye guys that's the manfrotto family it could mean like do you use them and photo thrive on do taking advantage of an afternoon nap time going to the office broken camera audio and conditions while I'm in here i thought i would take a second to talk about camera equipment namely this thing here this flexible tripod day it's sort of my mainstay it's my go-to it's not raped this is a really good compact tripod and when you set it up to look something like this this is a really good camera mount you can put the camera on their clip it onto anything that this is a really good selfie stick put your camera on the end great for taking pictures or video of yourself this is a really good camera mount you put it there makes it easy to hold the camera steady all this stuff's amazing but the problem is this stuff takes up a lot of space this thing does everything these do just not very well and the reason why I bring this up today is because in every at least once a week this camp hey watch my camera falls over people in the comments give me a really hard time for it like I'm doing it on purpose which is an outrageous thing to suggest that's how that's how my camera falls over I think I'm setting this thing up securely it feel secure is it secure yes it's secure and then I walk away from the camera to turn around to talk to camera or whatever by the time I turn around the camera have fallen over of course if you are using a proper tripod that wouldn't happen a proper amount like this that would never happen but usually this is all I have in an average video like yesterday i set my camera exactly so the chances that it's gonna tip over one of those times is pretty good so it's less of a matter of carelessness and more just like this is super versatile small light easy to use but it like does have a tendency to tip over if you don't really take your time to set it up I hope you now understand why the camera falls over so often it I didn't do that on purpose yeah so i have to replace this camera with one of my problems here most of these cameras are also broken in one way or another like this camera for example this is my old 70d great camera but i also broke the microphone thing there so it has to stay in the studio and be treated like really carefully otherwise it gets all walkie is one of my 80 DS great camera but this one broken LCD so this doesn't turn on at all this one took a fall I think this happened I think this happened when I fell off my skateboard but the students to work you all right back in action that's backward well all the luck yeah I don't know much but I do know that boosted boards are not meant for skate

of binge watch it watch daily i watch like five in one day ok ok all right so just want to make sure you're actually watching yeah the one that I like where I love that i'm on the spot right now to explain it well I just you know my homework I promise I watched your blog no but I did like the one dancing parts where where she didn't okay now you're making me nervous because you figured area and might be I did that I grew up Sisyphus was this king who wouldn't stop lying so as a punishment for his lying he had to push this gigantic boulder up a hill and every time it got to the top of the hill it would roll back down at the bottom and you have to roll it back up to the top and then fall down bottom and even roll it back up to the top and that was his life for all of eternity is a ridiculously beautiful day in new york city today but like every other day I will spend it inside at my desk writing emails i am Sisyphus and email is my Boulder I'm sick he being sick morning I don't even know that guy Candace parked on the street last night and needs me to put money in the meter silver car doesn't get a ticket but the money needed to go in the meter 37 minutes yes there's a very high likelihood that she got a ticket sixty five dollars I shouldn't be running because I'm sick but i'm going to make a quick run to three miles just to start yeah yeah that's three miles on a seven minute pace with that going for a run and make me feel better it didn't feel dizzy and just generally horrible my friends little have a nice walk have a nice walk so a lot of people in the comments rascal how I fill my runs I actually just use my iphone which the quality is like astounding up with the video is on this stage and then yeah just stick it wherever so like I don't bring a tripod I just like rested against the garbage can or clean it up against the curve or whatever there's not a whole lot to it and I feel terrible today terrible yeah in today's blog I want to tell a story tell the story of this studio space and and how it came to be so it was like 2002 maybe 2003 and I was like 21 years old I just like found my footing in new york city i had a full-time job as a really good paycheck and i was hired to direct a candy bar commercial and these were just regular candy bars these were Atkins low carb diet candy bars it wasn't a particularly creative job wasn't like a super awesome gig was the first like really paid job i had as like a filmmaker and the paycheck for the gig was the paycheck was ten thousand dollars which seems like a whole lot of money you know what ten thousand dollars is a whole lot of money but after i got that paycheck I immediately quit my job it was like a really good really save job like lots of potential if someone were to come to me for advice and say I've got this ten-thousand-dollar should i quit my day job my advice would be no but that's right it I quit my day job at 10 G's and I started looking for an office space and I came and looked at this building which is in Chinatown in New York City and they showed me a bunch of spaces in my price range by price range was like 5 600 bucks a month can't get much in New York City for that amount of money and the places they showed me had no windows they're really small crappy there were less than what I had hoped for and then they showed me just space in space was like a 250 square foot box 14 p x 14 feet but it had these two enormous windows that looked on to Broadway but it was like I think was eleven hundred dollars a month but I sign the lease I took the space anyways and after first month last month security deposit and whatever their stupid charges it oh I had to pay like several months in advance is terrible credit I was left with enough money to last 30 days the last one month in this space so is like hustle figure out how to pay next month's rent or I was totally like a creek and on top of all that I had quit my job so I had no real income source it was a major leap of day but it worked out I don't know what the first painting job was but it happened and the rest is kind of history on the space this here is organic whole you see this was in 2007 when I started production on HBO show actually had some money we evicted the woman next door and expanded from our little space into this much larger space combining the two making what is now like my production studio I looked through all my old footage in the only the only content i could find of this studio space when it was really raw was the profit into the unedited footage from a from a commercial shoot that my brother and I did for a fancy tote bag company called jack spade and to show off the durability of their bags we thought we would fill up one of their tote bags with fireworks and light it off and then show that the bag withstand the explosion and in the process we accidentally with the entire studio on fire just a disclaimer this was a much younger much more irresponsible Casey than the adult married father of two that I am today please do not try this at home yeah hell naw yeah",

            "subtitles": "yeah these photos are pretty great this one is probably my favorite but it's easy as it looks today's Monday on Wednesday super early in the morning Candice Francine and I fly to Los Angeles in two days today is one of those days where i'm going to do some explaining here on the blog but before I do well my friend dan is here from South Africa say something South African what's up fruit that's pretty South African you know how to ride one of these will be all right all right you're not like specific it's just like surfing but through the streets of Manhattan yeah how's New York City been freaking out here but I could live here i could fully live yet you think so yeah <addressnum> seven seven </addressnum> south africans do so follow me maybe this is a really bad idea you have to lean into it then you know Dan is like one person I cannot give a hard time too because i was in South Africa with him this guy's like a champion surfer and he had to put up with me sucking in the ocean he was very sweet about it so did you want to scream look at all that green all right let's go that was really impressive down yeah man for someone who doesn't skateboard this one is yours is the deeper yeah it's pretty strong what time is your flight like knowledge but I'll see in Cape Town you please yeah is it this time well sir so from the sea not on the street sweetbreads get the seeds are good to see you he travels a catch isn't by ok back to today's youtube video yeah there are a lot of reoccurring themes in this blog and lately there have been there have been two themes and the trouble with those two themes is that they're entirely contradictory they really don't make sense together whatsoever and that's what i wanted to explain today those two contradictory themes are how I absolutely love new york city and all that it represents and then how can this and I are always talking about moving in leaving New York City then I i did want to preface this whole thing by saying my work my life my business which I have no intention of moving they're all here in New York City so this conversation that Candice and I are always having about moving out of New York City it's not like tomorrow or this week it's years in the future it's it's this this is how I see Life this well this is a book called no country for old men but a book a book is a perfect metaphor for how I see Life now a book is made up of chapters just like life so your life is broken up into these chapters and for me a chapter is like a segment in life that feels kind of compartmentalize like my childhood my childhood is a really compartmentalised aspect of my life chapter one in the book that is my life this is literally the last time I graduated from any school in my entire life I was frustrated for the vast majority of my childhood that's me crying and that's my dad and me in Central Park I don't like four years old there check out my hat anyway childhood chapter one now this next chapter which is chapter 2 when i dropped out of high school ran away from home had baby Owen was on welfare like living in a trailer park this was a really challenging time in my life is also from when i went from being a kid to be an adult look that's Owen and that to me is own second birthday so fat I was look at that fat face i had that's all in that's my mom and that's me with my very first video camera now chapter three chapter 3 started when I moved to New York see it was me leaving behind like a life and be pursuing a life of the unknown like me chasing a dream this is my very first press book that says nice that press october two thousand two until august two thousand for these were the very first time that anything I ever did get any recognition this is the first time i ever saw my name in print a film that my brother and I made got runner-up in some film festival and look it says my name right there in this part this segment chapter 3 if i had to put one title on this part of my life I would definitely call it New York City this hugely transformative phase in my life took place that happen because it it is completely married to this great city all the sudden I'm like married and I have a one-year-old baby and kid it's about to go to college and I have a business and I have all of these have all this established stuff and if there was something that was missing from all of chapter three is any sort of establishment that entire phase of my life was about recklessness and spontaneity so I think that right now I'm entering into a new chapter I never ever saw myself living in any one place for the whole of my life and I've been in New York now for 15 years and when I think about the future I think like an environmental change is something that's really interesting to me and I don't believe that liking something so much should preclude you from trying something new what that literally means is even though i absolutely love this city that is not a good enough reason for me to not try something else so yes my affinity for an obsession around this city absolutely contradicts my curiosity about leaving the city but I've also always said New York City is only for the young and broke and the rich and all and I'm entering into a phase of my life around neither of those two I hope that was helpful also for whatever it's worth we're not going anywhere for years like who knows where i'll be in a couple years for context i will be walking for like eight months just a special end of the vlog announcement i'll be posting a second video today this afternoon at three pm it's like an announcement video we never done anything like this before check it out let me know what you think that's 3 p.m. today",

then everybody got really happy I kind of connected the dots and I had an idea for this morning to maintain that level of happiness companies have two dozen of your finest gonna know how to do it thank you have a nice day if this doesn't make everybody happy I you know I don't know I just I give up I don't understand corporate management also this was not sponsored at all by dozen donuts in fact twenty dollars for two dozen donuts seems a little on the pricey side to me dunkin donuts and get are you I don't well what's that about you know i just noticed how happy that people need everyone last night and so you decided these work for me it's working it's working in today's vlog i'm going to make another pair of some sunglasses because I think it's time that I give up on finding mine it's just I don't feel the same without my normal custom shades on top of that like there's this comment on yesterday's blog dear Casey what we're in those glasses you should just make another pair of your custom glasses and I think that I think that's a really whoever said that's like really insightful and smart so I should just understand making the pair of shades yeah and i'm here in these please I don't need like a boxer that they are we just take them this is just for the war 2 i'm going to avoid that working for the day is over ok you don't want to wear them are you wanted to take him just like that are we cool yeah i just checked into your calendar receipt thank you before I get started with this video please know that i made like a really awesome video about a year and a half ago or something that explains the history of my custom-made sunglasses like how the design came to be you should watch that you can watch it right here or you can click right here or you can click on the link below it's an awesome movie to make these glasses look really awesome you have to do some serious work first of all you can't use white out I don't know why everybody thinks I just squirt whiteout that's not how you do it it really needs to look like these things are these things have like survive some sort of horrific pain explosion disaster to give it that like really deep good look step one is to remove the ray-ban logo off the side of these ray-ban wayfarers ray-ban incredible product like all legacy product it's amazing these classes are so high quality but their branding might be the worst ever so ray ban the company you make something amazing your product top notch whatever ad agency has rave and the campaign sucks it sucks it's lame it makes me so embarrassed on a pair of ravens that I scrape rabe and off of the glasses so people don't know that they're ray bans the key to cool is that you should not to tell someone you're cool you have to tell someone you're cool you're immediately not cool stop convincing people these are cool and just be cool they are cool you have to tell me they're cool the whole never hide campaign is a disaster you could can the entire thing but let's get started step 1 removing the raid and logo it's already took the low block experiment wear them for eye protection I recommend using something a little bit more um this is an angle grinder now you can see how the ray-ban logo has been scraped off its entirety I take an oil-based paint marker here and I just fill in where it says rabe and with this oil based paint and when that drive that will fill in like the crevice where the logo once was in that way when the white paint chips which he wanted to do it will never reveal the the ray-ban logo you also have to remove the ray-ban logo from the lens you want a sharp night and you just kind of scrape looks clean try to scratch the lens now we paint primer up his webster and that's what you want and then that's it now we just wait for that paint to dry two hours later tail so these are dry enough now I take a popsicle stick and now I just like attack it and scrape off the pink yeah but that which script off the yeah that looks good all right I've been scratching for days here these are pretty much looking good don't take a little time before they look a little bit more natural wearing black pants while you do this is never a good idea the last thing I'm gonna do is I will engrave my name and phone number right there in the side yeah yeah after you in grade it you do take the whiteout you fill it up with whiteout wipe off the paint that's so good I put my phone number on there and then write the same thing on the other side for style points i put that on there pretty good huh all right gentlemen run out of here you go to be using other people outside there's to give well as bored as me nice to meet you at all times so its up Jack till tomorrow what you need all right leaving work headed home now i did want to plug tomorrow's vlog though ah tomorrow's vlog will be uploaded very late so are you sociopath to wake up an ATM to see the blog don't sleep in it's going to be late but

Regis Hotel in houston texas it is like a thousand degrees out here whatever let's get this started 23 why I'm here at like a patio at a hotel in houston texas is because we're in town for a funeral I thought I would make this whole Q&A around the theme of family okay Scott tell that asks are there any films you made specifically for your family yeah when my dad got cancer like 10 years ago I made a movie for him about us kids his kids and I used the metaphor the analogy of like he was a b-52 bomber and we were little atomic bonds that he dropped on the world that was really personal film that i made just for my dad Alyssa asks how do you think Francine will react to watching your blog's when she's older I don't know but all of the footage of me from when I was a baby is like around the holiday or birthday or like opening a present for some sort of event and what I would love it to see what I was like when I was a baby or when I was a kid just like living my normal life so if I were friends scene i would love it but who knows huh no okay Garrett asks another kid if having kids didn't require the whole pregnancy thing I would have like 50 of them but i honestly don't know if my marriage to Candace could survive another pregnancy so the answer to the question about whether or not to have more kids is a big fat ? been Porter who is the most inspirational member of your family to me my Nana she died a couple years ago book my grandmother was my hero I made a movie about all link it here but she she was a tap dancer entertain the troops are in World War two she found her passion in life to dance and she did it literally until the day before she died when she was 92 she is just like to me she embodies everything that ever sought after in life which is finding what makes you happy and literally doing it every single de lose Owens real mother what like he has a fake mother Owens real mother is Robin she's with Owen right now in Arizona looking at colleges Alberto does it damage you to spend so much time working far from your family I think what you're asking is like is it bad for the family that I work so much I don't know it's a trade-off in life for me probably because i was so poor when I had Owen providing for my family is my number one priority which means that like spending time with my family come second to my ability to provide for them and what that means that rather spend less time with them and know that they have a safe home and all their needs are fulfilled than it does for me to be with them all day long but us to struggle and me to not you know have the confidence to know that I'm going to be able to put a roof over their head and pay for food and I know that sounds like extremes to live a very comfortable life and i still work really hard but it's like a concern and fear i I can't shake because when you know what it means to be hungry and when you know what it means to not be able to provide for your kids it pushes you really hard to want to make sure that that they're safe their whole lives Douglas asks what's the craziest experience you've had with canvas around the world ok there are a whole bunch one time I was doing like a big art show in paris and i stayed in this absurdly expensive hotel that Sony paid for it is a sponsored the event and the hotel was so dim like you literally couldn't see your way around the hotel is called the hotel costs look it up and one night we came back and she was really pissed off about how dark it was no tell and she took a towel and she smashed out every light bulb in the elevator and then in the hallway of the hotel so it really pitch black she was a total troublemaker when she was younger I don't know that's the craziest that's like the one I can think of ok that's it for today's Q&A i'm glad i was able to get in because i wasn't sure i was even do a blog at all today and Q&A is one of my favorite things to do on this blog it's one of the times i really get to interact with the audience and like a very literal way there's a man smoking cigarettes over here watch this whole thing physically I do it you talking to just the camera ok that's it for today's walk Oh Wow",

our bedroom than the old apart are you cutting that in half important to start today with a healthy how's the date going so far great great way to start to get why you're having fun I'm having a great time this is a great date honey yeah Kansas has a doctor's appointment very close to the office so i'm sharing or her taxi with her so we can have a little bit more quality time together I don't need to be in this taxi dough I got my boosted board I'm just doing this so because Candice basically begged me to ask I'm getting a lot of questions about studio renovation how that's coming it's going really well this room is done my desk is done all that's left out here really is to finish this area up which is getting there shelving is still in perfect and perfect and perfect and perfect it's not right but it's almost right this is an art school for a friend made time to remove that and make a right right here and then that's it the studio is completely done out here all that's left is in here and and that's a huge amount of work because this is what it currently looks like I don't know it just looks like a total train wreck in here to disaster and when I'm done this is sort of this is my inspiration my camera layout is then we look like the gear closet in the movie the Kings now these are going to be cameras gear microphones this is what it's going to look like in there I wanted to live somewhere between like a camera rental shop in a museum that's it so the studio is like seventy to eighty percent done but progress is really decline because I've been traveling and just been busy this just came in the mail and open it on camera you don't know what it is but it is very very it feels important or special that says comments comments know what this is your book this is from YouTube Wow all right what this is what this is this is from YouTube they made this for me it's a book it's all like comments from my videos and then they had artists interpret those comments and turn them into like artwork this is so good and so special youtube what did I do to deserve this thank you Wow I love it when people make things for me look at that look at this speed still have work to do here at the office but tennis just texted me she went home early the middle of an afternoon on a friday Minister out having another date Candace earlier today not supposed to say that there are some people looking at its over your left shoulder spotted so nice to take a break from work for a minute hydro lady now i'm on my way back and we should do that more off trying to figure out why all i care in my office all day where fire alongside the entire block is burning down yeah find me guess I've got that scaffolding fell it's like 6pm the days over and I don't feel like I've gotten anything done today I had a fun morning with Candace I have fun afternoon going to see Candace again and then I was just trying to do a bunch of nothingness they got me thinking about distractions distractions distractions are everywhere and if you're a youtuber or filmmaker somebody created with tries to make things you know how easy it is to start something how hard it is to finish something because between starting and finishing like all of these distractions all these forces that keep you from getting from here to here the way that I combat that like my thesis for this show is to embrace the distraction and have the distraction just be part of the narrative so today Candis cause me and then when i come back here and I'm like sitting on that why i had anything done today it's because I was so distracted so I'm like okay let's talk about distractions distractions are part of the reason why i read this entire studio at its core the purpose of the studio serves is to remove all of the distractions for all the obstructions between me and making a movie but become such a total mess in your such a cluster that made it hard for me to actually make movies so now so now we're redoing it all so it makes it really easy for me to make movies and the last thing the king's men style closet back there is where all the gear goes so it's like perfectly organized and perfectly accessible and that is essential having your gear like situation i have to think about the equipment that's involved in making these videos is essential and that is best summed up by a quote by my good friend Max Joseph gear is the ultimate procrastination the reason why i like I hate it when people ask me what you shoot that on it seems like who gives a sh the gear all of this is just a tool to facilitate the process this is the stuff doesn't matter in spending too much time trying to find him engine deal that care near has distracted me so soon the student will be built it will be perfect for dealing with all the equipment for now let's look at this like 12 left it sitting on my desk ok i'm finishing up and going God my hair is long better don't get any ideas canvas",

right just finished shooting the back i think it's our last shot they have to go all we shot today outside with these little skits these little pieces of the movie but not the actual movie now that

because I did the work the gal just got in here and kick some serious and on top of that we move the entire meal time operation over here to the annex which by the way is filling up and really I think it was the whole meal time situation that was like at the core of this studio falling apart I just wasn't proactive and up and opening the boxes and they started to pile up we got a visitor this like a librarian of some sort out their concert held here never did i miss the smell of sweat smells good work Jesse you interrupted me I was just giving a tour because the studio has never had didn't look this good in months but you just looked into the war room and I haven't shared that yet what do you think you told me that you're gonna do this like months ago and I'm like did you do it is like all my guy this is like a filmmakers dream right now but gun not done what help it's like an armory it's an armored lighting that gun yet said drone setups not completely done the camera setup somebody

returned to its previous glory it's still not done here and even the gear room that showed you earlier when Jesse was here even that's not done it's it's far from perfect the studio it's a little like xenos dichotomy paradox where you're never a hundred percent done yet fifty percent done in 75% on than 87 . you're only ever getting halfway halfway halfway there so you never actually done because I've been in this space for 12 years not there were a finish line I would have crossed it like fashion you have to keep iterating on it i love where it is right now especially with the new gear closet

you - nice to meet you as well take care so much fans ok let's go back Zach miss me you gotta follow me - perfect happy bastille day want to see something crazy cute Oh this is when Francine was born look a little but look it says through canvas his last name is pool pol and we didn't name her for a couple days so her name in the hospital was poo only allowed three letters p oo poop all right why am i showing you all this footage from when the baby was born this was last December and of course when Francine was born that was the most important thing happening in my entire life at the moment on today's blog I want to talk about this second most important thing that was happening in my life at the exact same time for any was born the only thing like that stands between you and everything you've ever wanted to do is doing it on today's blog being a history lesson a super short history about how being came to be I love social media I like so much of my career to social media I use every social media platform out there but I've always had like my own ideas about what is needed in social media and about a year and a half ago sharing those ideas with like a mentor of mine I was encouraged he encouraged me I realized then that all that stood between me and everything I've ever wanted to do in life was doing it and that's when I decided to start being the first thing i did was i needed money so I went around and and asked everybody that I could think of that might give me money for money and I got a small amount of money i wanted to start a technology company but i'm not a technologist I don't know how to do these things so I set out on this mission to figure out how and eventually I met Matt Matt is my business partner that is a visionary that knows technology Matt ran engineering at tumblr from when they were this big until the tumblr you know today this guy knows how to make things happen and he's a visionary shares these shares the big picture with me hi Matt tell me why being it's the first thing since I left tumblr that felt like it could be that big with millions of people would actually get love and get up test within the same way for like six months it was just the two of us trying to figure out what being is how to do this like big ambitious idea that we had how do we realize this and at the end of those six months we built like it's not an aperture sort of looks like an app on your phone and that's when we needed more money and this workout really scary like really scary never asked anybody for money the last time I asked someone for money was like freshman year of high school ask my dad for us for lunch money so I could buy a dump my mind after class asking for money is scary and we needed a lot of money so I leaned out all the influential people i know to set me up with meetings with the kind of people that can write big fat checks for entrepreneurs like me that we want to start a company there called venture capitalist now i'm going to look up on Wikipedia what a venture capitalist is so I can explain it to you is financial capital provided to early-stage high potential growth startup companies just getting a meeting with these bc's was tricky then you have to sit down in front of them you have to tell them your idea and then you ask them for insane amount of money it's a little bit like going up to like the best looking person in your entire high school and asking them to prom and invariably they're going to say no i'm not going to go to prom with you some of them said you wanted to go to prom alone this year and if your prom king I'll go with you next year but most of them just said no and when someone says no to you it like it rattles your confidence it really like gets into your head and we were doing meeting after meeting after meeting after meeting it and while all of this was taking place Candice was nine months pregnant in houston texas she was like ready to pop yeah then our second trip out there finally got like some actual like tangible interest people that that wanted to invest your sort of wanted to invest that morning 7am Candace calls me nothing turning that we had no hanging up that check and this is like two weeks early the doctor gives assurances there was no chance he was going to go into labor I just hope to wait for it Matt and I are racing to the airport we have to cancel all of our important venture capitalists meetings i flew to Texas we have the baby everything was perfect here's a great little video I made about going to have the baby but the deal didn't close and Candice and I were in the hospital with Francine when she was born for five days and I never left the hospital for those five days i stayed with her but i commandeered the nurses break room which was right next to candice's hospital room and I literally spend every moment that canvas was asleep in that nurses room with this notepad on my phone like this trying to make the deal happen in in the end Francine was perfectly healthy we left the hospital with our lovely new beautiful healthy baby girl and in the end man I closed on over 2 million dollars in funding for being ok heading home now very possible answer xhamster matter with you I did it was never perfect ok are we going out to dinner yeah I don't know are you going to put clothes on you just wear your underwear Candace is completely naked when i came home internet when I asked her why she said she was hot we have an air conditioner you just turn it on and it's fully clothed and apartments hi baby girl who's outside

that not mad primer take care I do not know that person yeah today Sunday today is a super low key day today started this family day we are spending the day of the family and we're going to shut what are we doing we went to breakfast Candace got in a fight with these two ladies sitting next to us and it's got a fight with these two ladies that was sitting there and then went for a walk in the baby fell asleep then we went to some stinky perfume store in the baby woke up and got some terrible ice cream and then we took a cab home so now i'm here alone in the office on a Sunday it's nice and quiet I thought it'd be a good time to have a little one-on-one talk I want to talk about this idea I want to talk about it for a while but I get nervous that i'll come across as like a didactic or preachy but the truth is what i think of the people that I've learned the most from in life it's been the folks that haven't been afraid to share their ideas therefore I shouldn't worry about being preachy and I should just speak I should just share this idea is more of a fundamental it's more of a principal it's one of like my guiding rules in life and I want to address it on this blog because a lot of people in the comments below whenever I do q and A's a lot of people ask me about what they should do when they're sort of at any kind of fork in the road any sort of crossroads in life and they need to make a decision what should they do and this is like being like decisions not like what should i have for lunch today in life you should only ever be doing one of two things and that is figuring out what you're most passionate about like finding your dreams in life and then to realizing those passions realizing those dreams and the first one is much harder than the second one if you know what you want to do no big deal you just commit your entire life to doing it and you need to get really close or you'll die trying but figuring out what it is that excites you what it is that you're most passionate about in life is really really tricky so how how I approach it and this is how I've always approached it this is how I approached it when i was on welfare when I was 17 years old as I approached it was washing dishes when I was 20 this is how I've approached my entire life and that is to absolutely fixate on what it is that I want to be doing all day long every day like what am i doing right now is this exactly where I want to be and I always checking with myself always checking in like always hitting that reset button I can always really confident in my actions because i know that my ambition is true it's like that platitude without a goal you can't score I really believe in that because if you can't see like the goalposts how do you know which way to kick the ball now this is by no means a shortcut or a way to make life easier every time I sort of made a big decision on what I wanted to do in life or I i I've discovered a passion it's been like years of pain and years of struggle to realize or to even get myself on the course to realize that when i first discovered filmmaking and I was like this is all I want in life I was 17 years old I was on welfare it took me a decade before I figured out how to make a living at it when i decided that i didn't want to date anymore i didn't want to be single then I was unhappy i wanted a family it took me years to talk and listen to marry me and then actually i was getting married and having a baby so realizing it takes time and realizing that requires commitment for its that first step that first decision . that enables you to sort of realize the ambition or at least begin the process to realize that ambition this is something I do every day even now I am 34 years old I feel like I've come really far in life but I want to go much further and I'm constantly re-evaluating my decisions and what I'm doing to make sure I'm on the path that I want to be on you know do I want to live in new york city forever i don't know i love this town but the idea of raising children here scares the crap out of me so that's something I'm constantly thinking about so anyways that's it's a pretty simple idea it's something that I believe in to the point of it being like religion I am always fixated on what am i doing and what do I want to be doing and then that guides me that is like that that is the lighthouse that I follow the darkness so what do I want to be doing right now right now I want to be doing two things number one sharing my ideas and sharing my perspectives in making these little creations that I plop on youtube every day and number two is my new company and I know I haven't gotten into it yet but the ambition behind that companies to build something that can empower that can affect everyone planet earth that can affect the whole world I realized that sounds lofty and ambitious but your grass should always be just outside your reach what's the point in having ambitions if they are seemingly unattainable ok that's it that's my big thought for today back to our regularly scheduled vlog tomorrow morning",

long meeting i'm going to go home she left all my stuff there and then go to the office midtown look up look up what are you doing that stop sign almost got hit by a car my guy who is literally smoking a blunt behind the wheel goes through a red light and a general break up off the floor i look up and he's smoking up one and goes like this like go ahead sweetheart you who's got nothing to get smoking plugs but if you're gonna do it don't run over people on skateboards dude it's like 5pm i still haven't gone to the office yet trying to get out of here I just like sit down my computer and start working and there's so much work to be done that like it at home there's nobody here bothering me I this is da this isn't mailtime this is just stopped my order i kind of want to apologize kid out that I want to apologize to him because i'm sure he thinks that was being rude and maybe I kind of was but like there's nothing I love more than meeting people like want to say hi to me because i like my youtube channel that honestly is like my favorite thing but I hate when people show up outside my office this is where I work i'm always so busy i'm running in and out of this place like I've my time here is very narrow and it's very stressful for me like we're running out of my office there's like 10 people like taking a picture i'll just outside like having a really intense business conversation with matt my business partner and we're like talking for like having a conversation like intensely and somebody came up and was like KC KC KC and I was just like excuse me I'm having a conversation and I could tell that he was really upset by me saying that so I'm sorry I didn't mean to upset you also didn't mean to like be rude or anything i'm generally not that root of a human being listed how appropriate alright I didn't order this somebody sent this to me there's a gift receipt there doesn't say who it's from just let's get forefoot check out the name of this book release your anger maybe instead of time I came outside to not interrupt me maybe I should just show up here and colored thank you whoever sent me also i know i said this was a male time but maybe this is mailtime disguises packages for things that I thought it ordered who I did order this ok what this is is this is like the tiniest drone you can but look this is a drone that fits in your pocket and it has a camera on it oh this is perfect so just lost my dream yesterday this is very exciting today's episode of kc nice thats blog is a review of this tiny itty-bitty drone ocean club three tongues out that's what I wouldn't eat these instructions are insane look at all that right typically i try to provide comprehensive reviews of new technology this is going to be whatever the opposite of compliments this is gonna be Who special visitor remember how is saying my life favorite person in the world in town well char this is my homie drone you know it's just saying last week that everybody says I'm short and I'm like not that short i just have really tall friends from 6 foot 9 no.62 it is very useful it that's not what I'm ordered this tiny foldable pocket road and i think i lost my drone this is the drone here now I charge the battery i downloaded the app this is what it looks like in your do your butt go it's just it just messin up the other old pal old broken hello get this this powerup works back alright it's been about 40 minutes later but i did get this thing to work I'm going to take off from you ready all right this is the tiny hand round taking off the hell did i just do ok false alarm once again have to do some key drones is not the hardware now this thing physically looks like what matters is the software like what powers it what controls it when you're counting on software to operate this like flying camera there's like so many variables and you need to be accounting software and like I invited my friend over I just make him sit there and watch me not fly my grill it literally says right now that your drone gently how could you put home but ok well here we are right in to reply black do what you want highland soon as she got the little guys airborne that there are no controls on the screen company will continue to eventual took down your template wouldn't do my job okay there it is i have a role some video on this thing ok you have a student group can you be so important that I see almost appear at least landed safely if you take it outside yeah certainly wait let me just read the manual first again ok I take back most of the bad stuff that I said about this drone that was pretty fun ok forward til 0x0 problems left till but he may go up and down the cootie because my office in front of a camera store there's a light in the window which makes us look professionally live resetting the drone it did not work the way it's going it going here girls what are you thinking a tiny flying thing and it doesn't have a camera well sort of this is what it looks like you kind of all that is a massive massive overstatement okay bring it back darn the Walkabout got 100 lb you need to show was in some Tim that cold and the wind I did lose a drone and that's an irresponsible thing to do it was a toy drone I probably should not have been flying it outside even setting fly outside but you know I was laughing and that was fun like kinda stupid having some late night on raw vegan food just farted I'm finding it helped the amount i remember telling you one day case you would be vegan did not know it I know it Francine whatever the music having a dance party cheese that's the cheese I thought she pooped her parents your pregnancy very good the conclusive outcome on this review is a determinate finger I'm really good at flying drones I've gotten so good at it i just think that I wasn't applying that row sure it will ever see it again yes we gotta get back this responsibility",

amount of time to my birthday in Kansas gets for me a rubber-like g-shock esque band so it doesn't balance doesn't jingle like I really can't break a rubber band and all the sudden what was once way too precious for me becomes a fairly practical wristwatch and the guy who owns the watch band company got in touch and nieces on the vlog music hello there when I was like I need it and white I want it to look like this I want it to be all dirty and stop looking and gross then today this shows up in the mail custom made white strap from everis whoo just want to say i will be nothing short of a miracle if i can install this without breaking my watch whoa Mike this is awesome thank you this is not a paid promotion or anything but if you want a fancy rubber band for your fancy watch ok back to mail time I know what's in these next mail time boxes so before I open them a quick story but right after i posted the snowboarding in New York City movie some guy commented or tweet that mean he said way to totally screw up your snowboard bag that bothered me for so many reasons the main reason was that like yes it did screw up my snowboard which i loved it didn't wreck it snowboarding the streets of Manhattan during the biggest blizzard in history is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and to not do that because I'm worried about something like scratching my snowboard just seemed so like sure thing like how short mind are you kid who commented on my youtube video ok now i can open the next mail time package because i'm pretty sure I know what it is yeah the company that made the snowboard that I was on in the video the company's called lib Tech they make my favorite snowboard they saw the video and they just sent me three brand-new snowboards firstly thank you lib Tech in second the moral of the story is opportunity and experience always Trump's material possessions at the end of the day if you do something that you are that passionate about like something that is that I mean come on snowboarding in new york city that like the universe will make it right in this case the universe is the snowboard manufacturers and they made it right by 73 new ones they sent me another box to a surfboard thanks liptak live to write this is a little abstract but but there with me every time in my life where I've had to kind of ignore the consequences and go for it for the most part it's worked out I'm thinking specifically like first time I max out my credit card to buy a video camera really stupid thing to do never max out your credit card but if I hadn't done it I may not have ever gotten into filmmaking when I quit my job as a dishwasher because i wanted to move to if I hadn't quit that job like what would have happened but the other side of the coin is like don't max out your credit card that's really stupid because don't quit your job that's really stupid because don't still worth the streets that's really stupid because there are always really good reasons not to do things like if you really you really believe that it's something you have to do the universe has a way of making it ok I'm not still talking about the snowboards by the way that's crazy but they're a good example of what I'm trying to talk about also lib Tech I love all the gear but like I don't really wear hats like this my head's too big New York City",

like yeah well that's pretty awesome great I'm site for it I'm just like - man thanks a lot guys see you later ok now i can finally do the QA roll the intro yeah also there's a garbage truck outside today doing whatever it is garbage trucks so if the sound is terrible i apologize there's nothing I can do if I've never answer any of your questions 1 i'm sorry i try to find questions that have like questions that challenge me a little bit ones that I think the answer will be interesting to a broader audience than just the person who asked it ok Chris wants to know will you continue blogging after your new business is up and running I hope so one of the reasons why i started this blog is because my new business is taking so much of my time that I wasn't making any movies so by having a blog it's a way for me to talk about my business it's a way for me to make sure I keep making movies it's just a way of like keeping me engaged with something i really love so I hope to maintain this as long as I can if my business starts to suffer I'll back off on the blogs but that's up to me to to control so I like to think I can figure it out besides the Empire State Building what's your favorite building the Chrysler Building on average how long it take you to put together your vlogs I don't know if you mean like post-production like editing anywhere between like two and seven hours to edit these things i do it at home at night in my apartment in my underwear like I can't take this sound ok I'm moving my Q&A operation is just too ok better quiet back here Chloe Donald wants to know what's your least favorite thing about New York the noise pollution there's no silence anywhere in the city any hour of any day Adam wants to know tell me how to succeed as in motivation I can't tell you that you have to find your own motivation can't rely on other people andrew wants to know how do you surround yourself with the right people that's a great question I don't know how to surround yourself with the right people what I do is like eliminate the bad people if you're somebody that I don't want my life get out what's the bump on your daughter's head her birthmark it'll go away poor thing it's amazing how often get asked the same question is can you watch the other q and A's before you ask a question please how do you not give a shit about what anyone thinks and just do your own thing that's a two-part answer to a two-part question the first part about how do you just do your own thing in life you have two options you can do your own thing and stand out or you can do what you're supposed to do you can do what everyone else does and you can fit in there's nothing wrong with fitting in but you're fitting into cultural or societal norms that were created by other people now in some cases these norms are great but in others that don't make sense these norms these rules were created by someone someone just like you or someone just like me I don't know who created these norms chances are they weren't anyone smarter than you or me and if i'm not a fan of the way things are I just do my own thing because I trust myself and I trust my perspective more so than that of other people part 2 how do you not give it about what people think of you mm I should preface this answer by saying I definitely got made fun of a lot for the way that I look when i was in school and all the bullies that picked on me are all losers now so never forget that people who judge others especially people who judge others based on things like looks on whether you're black or white whether you're Jewish or Muslim whether you're gay or straight because of their body type with it a fat or skinny whether you have pimples or whether you have a big butt these judgmental people their opinions don't matter because they don't matter judgmental people are of a lower moral authority than those who don't judge and we people who don't judge we have a responsibility to crush to destroy those mean judgmental bullies and we do that with an overwhelming positivity and we do that with our extreme open-mindedness and when you subscribe to those those values you really stop caring what other people think because chances are if other people are judging you they're wrong Gordon wants to know could you convince Candace to your blog one day actually this morning trying to convince her to let me do a whole lot about her so I'm working on it Candace is great in these logs and she's so pretty but I understand she gets a little shy sometimes I got to stop I'm gonna stop like you

what's up you know I like New York City casing ok good to see you I brought him back to New York City good to see you thanks for scaring me later dude really it's hard that far yes there is last week I did a video called Casey's guide to filmmaking or logging or something like that people seem to really like it i want to continue with that being today and talk about blogging cameras let me start by saying this now for the longest time blogging was done like this you got a point and shoot like this and hold it out and you talked into it like that I used to blog like that then Brown fun for Louie they really like those guys are amazing with what they do maybe still do with their point and shoots and when i started blogging I aspired to be like them and using my point and shoot like this but I had some sort of maybe Holland an epiphany it was an accident but I remember exactly the vlog that happened in I was bringing my big ass lr with a proper microphone on it to go visit canvas to do a shoot with her and i have in my hand on a gorillapod and I was like let me just try to talk me into this and that was the first time ever because the first time of lager used to set up like this and now i see a lot of others do it using a setup like this that is like some version of an SLR on this crew gorillapod using a proper microphone and I think it's awesome because the quality is so much better that the pictures so much better but i just want to be clear about one thing from now until the dawn of time anyone you see using a rig like this know that I did it first until I want to talk about what could potentially be the future of logging cameras and that's what's in this box so this is kind of like an unboxing video it's not going to be like a full review because I need some time to get used to this but I'm site to check it out and share first here this looks like a case for tiny little guitar well it's not it's not broken I have to go back home I didn't break it but i am going to spend some time with this and read the manual and figure out actually use it before which i'm looking forward to doing it looks pretty rad i should also say that this is not in any way an endorsement of this thing this is also not a sponsored post or branded content or any of those buzzy like Adwords i'm typically very skeptical of new technology especially when it's this crazy ones like to check this thing out I know today is an unboxing blog and not a regular blog I totally forgot i'm doing this big interview with all these YouTube folks behind me that's a microphone camera guys interview this is security over here : Casey is that buddy and me to clap or anything actually go ahead and clap on time ok we just wrapped you just wrap the interview how to go great amazing take a picture yeah but then i gotta kick you guys out of here to get a fish by a boxing blog today I'm trying here it's fully charged I've been trying to get this thing running for quite a while now haven't had luck yet in order to use the app which is essential to use the camera you have to first register and right now like you won't let me register I really wish there was a way to use this without having to register whatever their social network is that's frustrating okay i'm gonna get back to trying to figure it this is why heat hardware that requires an app to run it I have it on now okay I really like this you hold your finger down and you move this around you can get it to fix on whatever you want there's the camera anyway yeah I'm gonna shoot on this now yeah okay this thing is incredible it's amazing this is next level and this is the future what this is not i don't see this yet as like the end-all be-all vlogging camera which is what i really hope for all the struggles that I have that including my freak out when i was trying to all those are over Kumble because I do that every time i get something new i'm sure that i'll get really good at this and I'm going to continue to use it a few years ago a Steadicam was this huge thing you have to attach your body and now i have like two three access gimbals that's one right there they're incredible for steady camera shots and now this like that is insane all right very very impressive piece of hardware this looks more like the future of cameras than anything else I've ever worked with and i look forward to really getting into it all right I gotta get out of here really gets me excited for where camera technology is headed especially camera technology you can hold in one hand that's made for blog I'm gonna play that thing a lot more this week and I'll give like a proper of you once I've had some time to really get to know hi I'm spirits and full meal because i live in create an island in Greece and you

subscribers you know there's no secret trick to growing your YouTube channel and this is like advice that no one likes hearing but if you make great content you will find your audience there's not much more to it than that you can hack it you can try to trick it and you might get a little bit of followers but if you want followers that actually care people watching your content that actually give a shit about it then it's about making content that people care about how do you manage being so optimistic about everything what's the alternative to be negative or cynical there's more than enough negativity in this world and negativity doesn't feel good negativity is just easy so if you put in the time to work hard at being positive and being optimistic it's a much better life but it does take more work negative people are typically lazy people how long does it take you to edit your vlogs like four to seven hours fastest and being like for them the more complicated ones take like seven Jacob asks how do you ever thought about giving up do you ever want an extra hour of sleep yes I always wanted that for hour of sleep what kind of a sicko doesn't want more sleep ok that flash this cameras on manual focus and it's on manual exposure and manual is so it should not be flashing like that you shouldn't be adjusting to anything I feel like I'm always bashing canon cameras but

and this is like a kc blog videos this is like a real production video something for samsung and I thought you liked that was boring video ever since us explaining how to use the hardware samsung probably mad that they didn't say that anyway I just saw a rough cut it's great i'm so excited about it I'm seeing a lot of comments about people saying that I haven't done like a regular episode in a while I was traveling and I made those videos about what it was like to be on the airplane and then yesterday I made two videos but what about New York City and one was about gear and I haven't done like a normal blog in a while so let me do that right now I'm missing my co-pilot the hardest part of probably for me as being away from Candace I mean is the family i miss work the city everything it's not just that she's my best friend here this is kind of like my only friend what I don't have her around it just kind of freaked out you know that thing that many people say where it's like

to it by morning i have not done mail time in a while and i got like a whole bunch of packages from companies and I know they just want me to promote their product and then when i open it i feel guilty like i have to promote their product but every once in a while there's a company that I want to help promote alright my boosted board was taken from at the airport in Australia by the way chill out you guys attack the Sydney Airport on Twitter and the poor like can you imagine the social media of the Sydney Airport us like field all these angry tweets about $PERCENT by volume as hell I'm act this anymore in any event in addition to losing boosted bored i lost the boosted word bag which is a piece of shit and I'm glad that it's out of my life in the meantime this guy named Mark he wrote me a letter it's not much of a company is really just like him this is like one guy is the opposite of a big company and he's trying to make like the ultimate boosted board bag and I gave him all this feedback all right zippers feel strong now the feedback i gave you mark with do not dwell on the padding his super tough and the package deals appropriately pick a are you driving already ok I'll be down in four and a half minutes by one thing i love the bag is no bigger than the board there's absolutely no need for extra space inside of the board bag and I feel like you nailed that which makes for a much much smaller back okay right off the bat cell phone maybe some critical feedback who are you kidding with these zippers here the main zipper is the correct strength these zippers on the pockets these are like little babies if purrs this is not the structural integrity needed on a big bag these handles here seem robust also i like that this fabric here is vertical vs at horizontal angle the horizontal angle put unnecessary stress at the joint which makes it tear this is solid like this I like this a lot mark alright the backpack straps are genius i look these d-rings here in this plastic clip here the weakest link cold weather is going to make this plastic brittle tossing around I'm gonna lift the bag up like this one day and this whole thing in a snap off track trying to make initial impressions o sight on this I'm super psyched on this all right if you are boosted board owner and each one of these bags go check out board bag and bored . . co I gotta go Candice outside waiting for me but if you want to know why I'm so willing to promote something like this this is the email from the guy who sent it to me i'm a one-person show right now if you have any

drone was and then it's just sitting there and supervise ok then this morning this happen this is a twitter account here called Casey's drone we have it and they've been following everybody that follows me it's just super typical troll activity this is a shot of their drone with a hook on it as if they went and got my grown and let me say that's impossible it's like Casey we took her first been a look at this footage I no phantom 4 footage that top phantom 4 footage here's the thing i know exactly where my drone is because it's on its way to the studio right now to be returned to me by someone who is not this joker I know where it is I know this cash is booked by a bolt all right we got an update we have an update they replied they said we have your drone I said how do i know you actually have it they said well there's only one up there the ledge we got there unless that is such now it's like they're like taunting me or something can you send me a picture of it let's see how they do with it I remember why I stopped getting dollar pizza ok in other news back to the Twitter little battle of got going on victory victory is ours look at this I said can you send me a picture of it and then they said this picture and then Ted LOL just kidding goodbye all right ready for this when I go ahead and refresh the page page deleted you will have to forgive my Cajun this year but my drone my phantom for that crashing the bridge it's on its way here now there's so much I can't tell you I can't tell you who the person is this returning it or how they got it I 10 tell you that no laws were broken and nothing criminal took place I've also agreed to completely disguise this person but put them on this episode I've already said too much they should be here soon they're here i'm going to apologize in advance for all of this blurring like i said i have to keep who they are confidential well we've got three we're going to get started here I hope you understand why I had to blur these two out these are the men that made it happen how did you retrieve the drone and once I see any video I said on your guide in just this bone is this the guy this is the guy right here on the good how did you get it done word up door all the girls your problem of roof I should love all the different response to be resolved coach you know there's gonna be a million other people trying to get the string and computed from we have to make sure that the test is complete without screaming professionals and this is it this is the favorite drone broken blade my number two written on it a little dirty the worse for wear thank you I have a present for you guys hold on let me get rid of your faces here ok I can't give him one of the new ones I already promised to give those away but yeah I got my old phantom to drone here with extra propellers two extra batteries controller and in this case this way you guys give me back my broken drone I did you the road cool that I would have given him one of the new phantom 4 is here but I can't I promise it give those a see you guys later thank you again for coming by i wish i could tell you where those guys were from they were so awesome now is the moment of truth does this thing still worked oh it's all corroded I'm gonna start by saying that this footage works so far nothing it's just not shown up all rights the memory cards pride i'm going to try one more reader okay so far so bad the memory card will not mount my hopes are not high for this drone there's like mildew on the inside of this thing all right i want to just lower everyone's expectations right now this is probably not going to work yeah is not supposed to be doing that what I want to do is see if i can connect the controller to the drone at all right it's going reserved but it is connected alright still saying cannot take off but it's not telling me why why yeah let's watch it blow your honor bret for 10 days who take her outside i believe i can fly i believe i considered the sky not I swear my way here we go there we go here we go I'm not gonna lie the pictures a little on the crazy side it's like shaking a little bit let's see how this thing and fly ok the picture is going crazy no no no it's crazy my thinking is that like yes it still works but the gimbal is a little like drunk it's like the home drone you've had too much to drink I'm bringing it in I mean that is ridiculous that this thing still works BAM drone number two now I know that footage was a little bit less than perfect and i'm not one to disappoint just in case I brought drone number three just in case throw number two wasn't perfect so today's episode is going to end with some beautiful cinematography of the Hudson River yeah yeah ok it's like six in the morning i totally forgot that I had to pick a winner for today from yesterday it so I didn't shoot it and I want to get in ok know that we pick this one are completely randomly so it doesn't matter

thank you Thank You Carly thank you total stranger matter this afternoon give you to phantom battery I'm not to make the droning in this video really good yeah yeah yeah hardware malfunction of log segment if today's episode looks a little different it's because i had a minor hardware about function yesterday we're in yet another one of these lenses exploded people love give me a hard time for breaking equipment but I make eight or nine videos a week i have this camera which is a a consumer-grade camera in my hand 18 hours a day i use this equipment and because of that sometimes I fall off my skateboard break lenses it happens if it had been a protective case it wouldn't have broken i also wouldn't be able to shoot a blog i kept my cameras and protective kids but when it comes to be there really is no hardware malfunction or just a little thing called human error so i don't have my wide-angle leg but I asked my friends at the nantucket project if they had a camera lens i could borrow they gave me one but it's manual which means like a lot of my shots are going to be out of focus is it doesn't focus automatically after gas like this is what the lens looks like it's actually a much better lens than the ones it ain't got no brain in it so it doesn't have to focus on its own that's why today's episode might look a little different and that concludes today's segments of hardware malfunction a human error story my turn my talk is not back there where the the rest of the presentations weather where the red my talk is at the church I'm going there now I don't entirely

and I was so scared to upload it at that time I had like a show on HBO I was producing feature films i thought like a big deal but youtube has a counter there was no hiding behind like the glamour that was television it was just real and that was a scary moment and then slowly over time I kept uploading and uploading and uploading and then went viral and it popped it about two people saw it on some people started saying hey I saw your video on youtube and then making YouTube videos became it was what I did what do i do I make youtube videos that's what i do and then it became a bigger and

thanks for coming by you have to see you soon will be putting weed out and fell out too long well did the Bible's i will be fun with Calvin Harris will this see you later one of my favorite things about what I do for a living is that I always get to meet interesting new people oh jesus you want to write it down all the way here it looks dangerous it's very dangerous all right good luck on you can do it before that even but I think that's your problem ok just a full disclosure Connor the photographer and owned on the unicycle that that happened yesterday but I couldn't fit in yesterday's long so i thought i put in today's blog but since today's log doesn't play until tomorrow anyways it matter that yesterday's content is in today for tomorrow's block I can't keep track of this stuff all right which which of these ones is preferable this one or there's this lens better like that's a little bit with the other one ok pretty usual every tuesday afternoon is team in a time where you guys to any questions post questions below email questions whatever and I try to answer them here we go Connor wants to know can you imagine living working somewhere that isn't New York in the future totally Candice and I talked a lot about moving to Los Angeles i think i mentioned that in this blog before maybe not Tillman wants to know what was your first camera and when did you get it hold tight Tillman this was my first video camera that's what it looks like it's broken in every which way it was like 17 hundred dollars and it was so expensive I couldn't pay for with one credit card ideas multiple credit cards all of which i maxed out to buy this thing Nina question from my dad who's a new fan welcome to his dad what has been your biggest failure I mean his dad I made a whole log called my biggest failure here i'll link it for you right here save me a whole bunch of lynn asks what's your opinion on bullying when I don't know that people can have an opinion on bullying people are either unequivocally against bullying or people are wrong i love bullying I can't stand bullying hurt people hurt people as if someone is hurt then they'd make it their mission to hurt other people and that's who bullies are when someone bullies me by saying something malicious in the comments or wherever I just block them from this YouTube channel I want them out of my life and i think that's that's kind of an analogy for life in general if someone is negative if someone is a bully to stay as far away from them as possible and something that my big brother van used to say which is really true and really harsh their life is their punishment if someone is really negative believe me when i say they'll have a horrible life ahead of them and that horrible life is their punishment for being such a negative hurtful person how would you feel if Owen got a girl pregnant that's a weird question elizabeth wants to know are you are Taylor Swift and of course I'm a Taylor Swift and what kind of a monster isn't a Taylor Swift fan aight and asks if you go back in time what advice would you give your 20 year old self don't listen to anyone that's what i tell myself do you think it's better to plan out your future all the way through or just play it by ear and see what happens I apologize if I've said this was long before I can't remember and this also isn't my original idea someone else told this to me but it's great it was a great piece of advice that I'm happy to share I believe in something called the Tarzan method and what that means is you are Tarzan me Tarzan starting on this side of the jungle your goals your dreams your aspirations there the other side of the jungle and there's no straight line through the jungle you know it let me do an animation . here the Tarzan method what that means is your Tarzan you're here and you want to get the other side of the jungle here ideally there's this straight line but when you find in life what I found in life this is non-existent this straight line here is a unicorn it doesn't exist instead you reach and you grab onto whatever divine you can grab onto and you swing and that vine might carry you in this direction which doesn't feel like the right direction your goal but it does get you a little bit closer and then you grab onto another bites with you all the way over here a little bit no sir and then you swing in this direction in this direction in this direction in this direction in this direction in this direction and eventually you make it to where you want to be but the beauty of the Tarzan method the kind of the magic of being open minded in your pursuit is that like these unknowns and where it might take you that you didn't imagine that's usually where you find something that is actually what your goals are I don't believe that there is a straight line between where you are and where you want to be in life ever not with family not with romantic interest and especially not your career so an open mindedness even if it looks like this will yield results and outcomes that otherwise would have been unforeseeable ok i'm ending the Q&A the x 2000 degrees in this office because the air conditioner because the air conditioner is broken Candice just texted me she's gonna get her nails done this evening so dads in charge of baby back and putting the baby to bed and love these nights",

up your ipod super fast Q&A time questions questions questions how's it going like I join me for a tu na i'm going to talk about you like you're not here okay this is louie kool Louie is the godfather of daily vlogging and I think I can speak for every daily vlogger on the interweb that he is a tremendous inspiration I don't know how he does it amazing content every day for the last nine hundred days anyways good to have you here thanks man that's the head means it looks me I like to answer some questions harry wants to know harry wants to know do you learn more from success or failure you want to take a stab at this um yeah I'd say i think i learned more from failure I guess all of us to have this need or want to succeed in some way but when you fail at something especially when it's like a dramatic fell you really makes you stop and take kind of thinking why did I fell like how can I avoid this I think that it's always the toughest times in your life that define who you are much more so than the easiest time for the best times so failures are typically some of the hardest times of your life so when I look back and I see all sort of the pivotal moments in my life it was always the struggle it was always the failure that motivated me not the light loveliness of success what's your favorite country to travel to i like i like South Africa I was gonna say South Africa because that's where I fell in love with my wife and another miss thing wants to know what's your favorite thing about making movies what I love about making movies is it's a way to share my perspectives and share my ideas with an audience that goes beyond the person sitting next to me and that's a really that's a really powerful thing and that is one of the biggest motivators and that is that is about that is what about moviemaking that that that I appreciate the most so here's a good one from it would halfway through the Cure night and it's going pretty well another good oh yeah I did wear this is where on my blog title of the sort of trouble and bloggers that out for yourself let me let me on to this one so , said Louie what you know more about casey and i would say i love his uniqueness is creativity and just that there's nothing there's nothing that I can see that he's modeled and uploads being a spy by lot of different things like it's it's just constant uniqueness I feel like every time of which one of his videos he's trying something different he's doing a different angle he's playing around with even this thing of like a split screen like I just love that I love like this by the way making Louie disappear there was really complicated took us like a lot of thinking to figure out how to do that yeah thank you for saying that come on okay here's a question I love maddy thank you for asking how tired are you being asked what camera you shot something with extremely tired it's the least interesting i just linked mind of every description because of just like look just look in the description what's the best advice you would give to someone who's worried about their future what to do after school my advice is always the same which is keep yourself extremely busy as long as you're doing something you will find your path it's when you get lazy that everything becomes huge everything becomes gray or foggy it's easier to ya on the Buckeyes easier to steer something that's already moving if you're just static and station is so hard to build me and you're a poet yeah Casey are you can never make your hair like Louise we kind of know man I don't have a vacation but

supply salesman he sold forks and knives and dishwashers and stuff like that you worked a lot and my mom was pretty hands-off when it came to parenting I described the majority of my childhood as wonderfully unsupervised as a pretty bad kid like there are these train tracks in our backyard and we hanging glass jars and mayonnaise off of the bridge so the jars with smash on the windshield of the train as it drove by also this one time my brother and I lit the tree fort on fire we didn't mean to we just want to have a small fire in our wooden 34 I didn't hate school but it wasn't great as always in trouble breaking something school trouble teacher trouble i remember vividly this constant anxiety I felt for most of my early school years it was a constant tension that my parents or teachers were going to find out about whatever trouble i was up to getting trouble really escalated when I got to high school I was always in the vice principal's office and attention and suspension freshman year was pretty uneventful but by my second year I was trying to find my place in school and started hanging out some of the really bad kids I got into a lot of fights and it was around this time that I discovered smoking weed and drinking alcohol this was also around the time my parents told us they're getting a divorce that didn't go well at all I put all the blame on my mom I really didn't like her then one night we got into this day argument and she ended the fight by saying do what I say or get out of this house and I left I was 15 years old and I ran out at nine o'clock at night on a tuesday ok so 15 years old and on my own I i stayed with some friends for a while and eventually moved in with these two slightly older girls naturally one of those girls became my girlfriend and a few weeks after I moved in with them my girlfriend got in a fight with a roommate and she told me she wanted to leave so her and I got her Honda and we left we drove from Connecticut to Virginia where my big brother van was in college I was happy in Virginia but after three months there my girlfriend got pregnant so we moved back to Connecticut and i dropped out of high school we lived in her friends basement for a while and eventually found an apartment I worked in the seafood restaurant as a dishwasher made eight bucks an hour then the following April just after my 17th birthday Owen was born and I was a dad now I don't know that teenagers are emotionally equipped for the magic that is having a child but the feeling I had in the hospital just after he was born it was similar to Christmas morning when I was little as like that feeling you have when you get exactly what you want we move into a trailer park it was cheap and in a less dangerous neighborhood and we were poor we were really poor we're even on welfare for a little while but i never liked the idea of handouts slowly things settled life was ok i made a little bit more money in the restaurant and when he was about a year and a half old we drove into new york city & state of my brother's apartment in Brooklyn it was our first vacation my older brother had just gotten an imac one of those funny shaped blue ones actually this is the exact time and this is the first time a queue could edit video on and we made this little movie of taking Owen to the zoo I love the process when we got back to Connecticut I immediately maxed out my only credit card and bought my own computer I spent all my free time making these little movies and for the first time in my life I felt like by telling these stories I had a voice then for a lot of good reasons Owens mom dumped me it sucked I didn't know what to do now before the break up I had this plan this dream to move to New York City in like five years but i just kind of said to hell with it and decided to move to New York City immediately it was june 2001 as 20 years old and I moved to New York City I was here to become a filmmaker filmmaker sounded so much cooler than dishwasher this was without a doubt the hardest time of my life i I didn't know anyone I didn't have a plan and for the first time ever I didn't get to see my kids every day you stayed in Connecticut with his mom and I go back to be within three days a week it made me so sad i didn't want Owen to grow up and think his dad was a loser that town in Connecticut was it felt like a dead end that first summer in New York City i worked as a bike messenger and eventually this artist named Tom sax something my brother new hired me for ten bucks an hour put aside a hundred dollars a week because that's what it would cost to get back to Connecticut to see Owen no matter what I wouldn't touch that travel money at the end of that summer my three month sublet was up and I moved into a friend's couch in the financial district of downtown Manhattan my buddy said that I could stay there for a month and the day I moved in was sep tember second 2001 yeah the blast from the first plane knocking out of bag and by the time the second plane hit I was on my bike trying to get away the the blast from the impact of the plane knocked me off my bike to the ground my dad called me that morning and he said to me it's time to come home I moved back to Connecticut and I thought about it but i figured i could barely afford to eat I didn't have anywhere to stay no education few prospects I thought there's just no way if you get any harder than this if I could figure out how to get through this I'd be okay and and so I did I committed everything to New York City - - my big dream and that's when things started to turn around my manual labor job into a real job with real opportunities as a studio manager for that artist a friend of a friend freaked out after the World Trade Center attacks and left the city I took over his super cheap apartment all the while I was making movies about whatever subject matter i could come up with I worked with my brother van we made movies for anyone that would pay us birthday videos any actor reals we literally said yes to anything that involves picking up a camera then 2003 i got my first ipod and when the battery died a year and a half later i got really pissed off and made a video about their dead battery policy and I put that online now this is like three years before YouTube but that video exploded this is back in the day when the word viral was used to describe an STD not a video to get started with you you know yet the first ipod generation one had a verb and all the sudden people started asking about other movies we had made in 2004 video series we shot in my apartment called science experiment was invited to be shown at the South paulo by a neo in Brazil things things started to get good and I had a little bit of money and i was able to spend more time with Owen and for the first time he and I started taking trips together with the pretzel for out you're going to feed the pretzels in the dolphin yeah when we traveled i felt like i was able to get to know him in a way that was entirely new when we travel it was just us and that i love that in 2006 i met this guy named Tom Scott here and a group of local TV channels and he hired van me to make some videos the videos came out great and and he made this big offer to us he simply said i want to bend for a big project you guys do now I've always understood luck to be where opportunity meets preparation and this was a big opportunity and we were certainly prepared so he agreed to fund us for a year it wasn't a lot of money just enough so my brother van and I lived and documented stories from our lives every couple of weeks we edit these experiences together to form like a 25 minute movie sort of eventually we had eight of those 25 minute episodes and we call that a TV series then in 2008 we we sold that eight-episode TV series to HBO for just under 2 million dollars it was it was a big deal yeah HBO show premiered in 2010 then my brother and I stopped working together I produced a couple of movies and ultimately I just shifted all of my focus to youtube I found my voice telling stories with my videos back in that trailer park and I'd finally found an audience for it on the Internet Owen Owen turn 16 a couple months ago he's taller than me now he's smarter than me and he's definitely better-looking we have never stopped traveling I don't think we ever will and I I oh that kid a lot the first two decades of my life were spent being told i was wrong not fitting in but this last decade of my life you know those days when you're in a rush to get somewhere and you catch every green light that's that's what it felt like 33 years old and I have no intention of slowing down yeah please yeah yeah it's a world of money you get home you have to touch on the base like flying a kind can you can Oh in the end get the top down yeah follow that dream silly and get you through your day yeah",

back in the office I've never been so buried or overwhelmed at work peak work day 2015 the spa being launched friday all kinds of crazy crap accrued over the weekend that needs to be dealt with and now i'm heading in right nearly to confront it thinking yeah you're welcome yeah I've been trying to be able to hover board out of the blog but i just missed it so much and had to make a comeback morning you looked and now that the cat is out of the bag with beam I can share some of the things that have been doing a really terrible job of blurring here in the office ok first thing is this awesome motivational this is already the team highly motivated and I've just been trying to blur the launch date and I was trying to blur it not because not because it's a secret but because like I didn't want to be held to it in fact we didn't end up launching when that was I didn't want to give people the wrong impression that's why we tried to blur that let's see what else these are some of our self-imposed deadlines like this was supposed to be when we have reactions up and running but this is the first deadline we missed me missed it by one day never okay I'm June first we had a hundred beta users and then we had a follow graph on june first is well that sort of worked and then I'm jun 10 we submitted to the app store and then our initial approval in the app store we only release the app in both senses a Christian but there's actually Kurdistan that's kind of complicated get to release it in a region before we can release an update we didn't end up doing any of that but we had a really funny plan where the app was only going to exist in Kurdistan didn't happen and I wanted to announce the app on the vlog on july 13 that didn't happen instead I now since July 17 but we were going to have it the app to download until the 20th it was just going to be the app where you could get on the waitlist and then we're going to launch it sneak preview on the twenty-third and then the official art sometime thereafter and just to be clear the launch last week was only supposed to be a sneak preview that's why we had to like that's why we had this is not mad and that's why we have the beam codes is because we want to sort of curved people from using it until we're really ready it didn't work out that way everyone use it anyways we're really excited about but that's why the being posted are sort of being held back now is because this is only supposed to be a sneak preview but we're going to deal with that this weekend will be a whole bunch of of being fields coming out so it will be able to get in and i am sorry that that people can't get in now that want to get it one of the new beam t-shirt show up on the way here hopefully there's a tremendous amount

windows they put children in the van this this is blog number 34 yesterday was blocked number 33 but I labels yesterday's blog 32 so out of 32 blogs at miss numbered four of them so my failure rate when it comes to numbering these logs is over ten percent editing these things is like effortless for me it's pure intuition but numbering them bring tax the titles it requires every ounce of energy and you give them and i still get up ten percent of the time not only car industry you are the only harmless free and on top of that i can clearly see your ticket from up here at a budget and budget teaching in two months alright got a solid hour this morning going to get in some miles 10.7 miles at a 718 paste special feature of this morning's walk to work Candace living with great that happy monday morning fish I'm gonna go five ok special special segment for today's law I don't know what this segment is yeah I guess this is let's talk about business this is a really abstract let's talk about business segments plus i really want to place intro again yeah i need like a prop for this but I think it's up there I want to tell the story of HBO show why this is part of the narrative behind my knee business this project this series this show represented what was my greatest achievement and what is my greatest failure of my career thus far ok here's the super abbreviated story of how they feel came to be into thousands cause five my brother then and i met this incredible man named Tom Scott he's the Tom from Tom and Tom that invented nantucket nectars nantucket nectars began with two guys named tom yes that is the top anyways back I Tom had sold nantucket nectars and he started this public access TV network and he asked my brother and me to make a movie about his public access TV networks the only creative direction he gave us was make sure it's respectable so we made this movie it was called the respectability tour we made this movie for Tom he loved it and then he came to my brother and me and he just said he said let's do something big together and we said let's do a TV show at the end of that year we took that out to Los Angeles and we shopped it most places didn't like it HBO loved it so we sold it to them ok quick recap I was a kid poor in my trailer park making movies with a big dream a few years later i sold my own TV show to HBO the biggest baddest name and television this is where my biggest failure begins because that was by far my biggest success at the time but HBO didn't air the show for two years and in those two years I did nothing I did nothing because i had made it I'd sold my show something I made to the biggest baddest TV channel in the business I had made it then they are the show I honestly expected my whole life to be different but the truth is nothing changed and the neighbor and reruns and all that but it's kind of over in like six months and this is where the most valuable lesson comes in you never actually make it there's never any making it you've never arrived like that platitude the journey is the destination it's cliché for a reason because it's really true I'm just gonna do a little drawing that shows what i mean when i say you never actually make it start and then here is life and for me I start busting my busting my chops and I find this success and then I get this place right here and this is what HBO bought my show and I thought this was making it I thought I had made it right there so I backed off I stopped fighting and I just kind of like chilled out and did nothing for a couple of years and then the show aired and it was like over and I looked around and here's where I was this is where I learned like life does have up to downs but you have to keep fighting in busting your ass to go like this you've got to maintain that you can never get comfortable because when you get comfortable this is what happens comfort this this is Comfort comfort is decline this is a fight you fight your way up so what I said that this story has an abstract connection with my new company I started this new company and there's no reason for me to start a new company I mean that i was doing really great for the first time in my life I had like some job security there's no reason for me to start this company but the desire was there and the desire had to be respected I couldn't get comfortable I had to keep fighting so that's why I'm rolling the dice and that's why I'm going for right now is because is because this this will never happen again in my life but this is me and this is the horrible hard-fought lesson that was my HBO series so the takeaway you've never made it with each success must come a newer and more ambitious goal you haven't crossed the finish line until you die broke leaving the world a better place and when you found it back to the new company this is the bigger more ambitious goal leaving the office now seven o'clock a dinner meeting tonight which i'd like to read I'm in the bathroom of this place we're having our business meeting i'm very sleepy i'm having trouble keeping my eyes open pull it together yeah",

gas stations at all downtown Manhattan look at this line for gas blocking traffic to go to one of these pumps I was thinking about talking about this and then I was like I'm not going to talk about it and then I was like I should talk about it and then I was like okay i'll talk about it so I'm going to talk about it as I was finishing the Edit for yesterday's episode I learned like the horrible horrible terror attack in France and today's episode i include what I would describe like a gesture of sympathy to the people of France and whatever I make gestures of sympathy in in this vlog the reaction is always positive but without exception there are always comments akin to a nice to see what you did today but the world needs to realize bigger stuff is happening is really disappointed Casey now you honor the deaths in France but you haven't talked about the Dallas shoe case you know that people died and Casey why be sad for the front you think you should raise more awareness for the people this is not the news they're just sometimes I see things and and I feel it's appropriate to acknowledge them sometimes huge things happen and I don't acknowledge them but it's a the attacking nice was particularly personal for me own and I were in Nice around that same street where the where the incident happened where there are three months ago like right there the bigger point is this to show your support to show sympathy for one thing is not to say that you're against or you don't have sympathy for another thing there's no hierarchy here so they can liken it to is like say you visit your Nana in the hospital who's in room 603 just because you're there to see Nana doesn't mean you don't feel bad for everybody else in that hospital but when you walk in to see Nana the nurse doesn't say I'm disappointed in you Casey how could you not visit everyone else in this hospital i bring this up not because my feelings are hurt i don't get it but that's up I bring this up because it is empathy it's the ability to show that I feel your pain that makes us human beings and the monsters that shoot police in dallas for that monster that that ran people down in a truck in France or a monster that sets off a bomb in medina these people they don't have the empathy that that makes us human the empathy that makes us people and to constantly criticized people like me for how I choose to show empathy is to discourage that very human emotion and emotions so powerful that it's an essential part of of the healing process and that healing process the showing of empathy it's what the world needs a lot of right now it shouldn't be discouraged because her mom your friends are here we don't have a places tonight so maybe we'll stay there in a hotel or staying at a friend's apartment i I don't know but yes only for being booted from our house tonight so mom and her friends and stay here which is fine alright granny's here but check out who else is here she's here for the night look at this who though we missed her this is the hotel that Candace picked and Sookie hunting it this is my little date for us there's a lot going on Bobby down to the size is so totally nice place careless you're ready all right I knew this was going to happen sooner than later but Candace downloaded pokemon today and now we are now we're going to go out Pokemon hunting at midnight on a friday we have to wake up early to party at the baby there's not there are no Pokemon -

be IG up you did are naturally friendly products toothpaste I'm going to need it because I have all this candy this is the weirdest skateboard I've ever seen but thank you for the weird skateboard ok it's time are you ready ok yeah yeah knocked over dr. the camera yeah so far what do we know we know that in that gigantic box were three slightly smaller boxes let's have a look in the first slightly smaller box we have a brand-new DJI phantom 4 road in the second box we have another DJI phantom 4 drone and in the first box we have a third DJI phantom 4 drone now I don't know a lot but I do know that no man needs seven drones and i already have four bring it on it and bring it up and since DJ I just gave these to me I'm trying to say their name a lot by the way so maybe we'll give me more dji:djia since I just gave these to me i'm going to give all three of them away and do another giveaway I don't really know like I don't really know the best way to structure this giveaway but since i have three of them I'll drag it out over like a week but i will give away one tomorrow just comment below tell me why you want it and I will have someone who's not me take the winter make sure you subscribe and comment below we'll like pick your name out of the comments and all the apps on the Block something like that and then I think of like a more like slightly more inventive way to give away these two drones but come on three brand new drone and it's it's my favorite robe that hole mailtime drone time business took me like 20 minutes look at the destruction no can i film something on your fire see sure that our kin in exchange for letting me use your fire escape I brought you all the skin tight so these they're delicious thanks sweet alright so i'm going to be giving away those drones and since i've been using grown so much lately I thought share with you some of my thoughts on drugs see I always thought that drones were like flying cameras and all I need to learn how to do is how to get the thing in the air without crashing it and have this magical cinematography to use to help me tell stories I was wrong no I had a fly drone is one-third of the pie that is actually having meaningful footage from a drill the other two pieces are being a drone cinematographer and then knowing what to use the footage for let me tell you something no one gives a shit about pretty aerial cinematography you're never going to be as good as national Geographics you're never going to be as good as killed Scott see nobody cares use that aerial footage to help tell your story to give context to a scene of contact so what's going on to help me the viewer understand what I'm seeing all of these things I've learned in the last couple of weeks trying to integrate drone into this show in a meaningful way thank you for letting me use your fire stick my pleasure good luck with that candy thank you letter scar yeah ok",

headquarters where they were fixing it new belts new actually only the fixating is nothing was broken belts are where item they just go they replace them listen to that power see these bizarre scratches their scars of usage yesterday's vlog I had some very serious technical issues with this very microphone here my audio is completely beat and a lot of people in the comments suggested all these technical fixes I appreciate your suggestions but I find them frustrating because at that you're not telling you don't know the truth is like yes I could attach like another reporter or a really high quality recorder or i can even attach like a small reporter and then I'd be recording audio independently and there's no chance to be screwed up where I could put like a better microphone on there or I could use like whatever this new microphone is or I could just go wireless and record it that way I mean there are million options and I could absolutely do but I wanted to explain today a little bit about like to share a little bit of the understanding of why don't give a shit about these technical innovations I just want what's easiest I'm gonna do some drawings here these about principles principalities principle tells principles internet filmmaking principles it goes like this here's me with my ideas on the other side of the spectrum is you the viewers who want to receive my ideas I think otherwise why are you watching this stuff i need to get my ideas from like conception to you the viewer and what stands between me and the viewers are these factors like the cameras in the entity in the posting and all this other tech stuff my job especially when it comes of logging is to marginalize all of this stuff the more i can remove them the more simple i can make the process the better on the y-axis here it goes from easy to use to tremendous pain in the ass on the x-axis here is the quality it looks like a potato vs like the highest quality there is so the more of a pain in the ass it is the higher the quality and with these blogs I want to hit a sweet spot that's like right here so the quality is good and it's not too hard to use so I want a microphone that I never have to think about I want a camera that focus is not any input from me I just want to hit a button and have it worked and I want to look as good as possible that's why i don't use any more difficult to use hardware than what I already use that's why I really don't get excited about new camera tech gear I just do whatever is easiest I have this leather jacket not this like an actual leather jacket it's my favorite jacket I've ever had but it's not super high quality got some store on broadway and it's starting to fall apart I've been looking how I've been looking but unable to find like a suitable replacement so I asked my friend who custom makes letter codes here in New York City and he could reverse-engineer my co and remake it using like the highest quality materials he has access to just to give a shameless plug to my friends store if you're ever in New York City on Crosby Street come to Jean shop for the finest quality jeans and leather goods around it's a parent now you know I'm starting to I appreciate it I appreciate it the other good on who says New Yorkers are rude just for the record my favorite jeans in my opinion the greatest things in the world come from the shop they're fantastically expensive but super super high quality stuff this man here this is eric he is the proprietor and owner of gene shop what are you going to midtown and this is midtown that look at this place this is insane so you don't think places like this still exists in new york city but they do that when people like Casey where'd you get that when I jacket I can be like you just come up this place on 38 street right so this is the original here so this is like a cloth version of what's going to be the leather jacket right now we're sizing it and it's just too small doesn't get the arms so they're gonna they're gonna modify this show you this week come back up here i'm gonna try it on again and then if it's the next time they're going to turn into leather conditioner is not only going to worry about no you take the fabulous one did I missed it this is just one of yours all right that's nice but this is not my jacket this is this is one of eric's jackets if you like this go to Jean shop and buy this thing cost as much as a brand new Ferrari you want oh my god that is in the same this light-filled this feels like wearing body armor made in New York City that's for your celebrity clientele their source a little bit of going it's a rockstar doing thank you my face getting a nice to meet you the lighting gotta decide on thank you again be careful on this cable a little bit that sound you're going to take it for a spin I could sit on it and I could do that this is great I'll see you soon on site yeah I'm really nice about a week which them ok fantastic that might be one of the most New York City experiences I've ever had that's insane that my new jacket this new jacket can be made in that Factory in New York thank you for the beam

While youtube flags content inappropriate for young audiences by requiring viewers to sign in, a lot of youtube content is generally unaudited if the uploader of the video does not flag it so. Also there is no distinction between which content is appropriate for what age groups. We will classify content based the film rating system: G, PG, PG-13 and R. We will also apply a binary classification for classifying clickbait videos."
