right here right here that's where I proposed to Candice so many years ago Oh Candice was actually supposed to be with me today instead I brought ah then I brought Peter so if you don't know Peter Peter is a fantastic youtuber he's a much better youtuber than me we're gonna spend the day where Peter teaches me how to make better vlogs thanks Peter no problem man [Music] we're in like the Courtyard hotel and they were like oh my god there were some people following us I think we're smiling though Peter what did you do before YouTube like why are you why are you why is your skill set with the camera so so next level the last job I had I spent seven years filming magicians around the world so I've had kind of the expertise the working expertise for seven straight years filming everywhere and then why why take your I take your skill set and your huge ass camera to YouTube I just I wanted a platform where I could share myself without limits and without anybody telling how I could do it so I figured that was just the best way and the best platform for it [Music] many years ago do you have any place to recommend to the right thank you [Music] down totally down you're like I'm really happy twelve-year-old Peter I've rode a bike and like had like the longest time and I'm pumped how am i doing the vlog by the way I think you're doing great so if everything looks good so far the cinematic sound when I read some bikes I do how do I make your globe float oh wait I can I got it I got it I got it Oh what you think renting bikes is a it's a good idea absolutely so we're gonna we're gonna start here come down here over here through here up here which I'll get into this bond Oh excellent penmanship winds how long did it take you to get to your first million subscribers well I guess wait for it wait for it it took nine months come on that's insane all right thank you sir [Music] [Music] you look good back there Peter they take their bike rules here really seriously so you got to stay on the correct side of the road you gotta obey traffic laws how is it you can vlog it there's a child coming at you how can you blog and ride anything I'd love to know that ready going through the tunnel my thesis on vlogging is that I try to do the best production quality I can but the story comes first so I never let my camera get in the way of the story that's why I don't carry a monster like this is because I don't feel like I could be spontaneous with such a beast yeah this definitely this definitely it's a beast you get used to it but this is turned into like a romantic honeymoon [Music] it's his first time in Amsterdam it's amazing here but we spending a lot of time in this kind of threshold to this parking garage because we're just getting so soaking wet its cinematic though its cinematic let's throw in a little bit of mckinnon slow-motion ready [Music] it's that kind of weather today where you can't be waxed it's just cold enough work you're wet and cold you'll get pneumonia we're just gonna wait for the rain to stop why is your lighting in your studio so good yeah I never used to die never used to put the work in the lighting always used the window and I was like wouldn't a light forever and then a friend of mine was like no buy a light so I bought a light diffused it set it up nice with a boom mic and everything and then suddenly if production values went through the riot in the studio and I turned my light out it looks like there's like a flashlight do you need to defuse light you can use a shower curtain you've got IKEA and buy a shower curtain just throw something in front of that light so it's softer then it'll look like just money Oh real quick we were having a lovely day on our bicycles and enjoying all that Amsterdam has back at the hotel Peter actually is staying in a separate hotel but then I checked in here and this hotel is huge so he's gonna sleep on that our couch and then I'm gonna sleep in the bedroom which is just down the hall so I said last week we remember I posted the video about Chantal that I wanted to put more energy into using my channel to talk about creators that I really liked and whose work I really liked so even though we're having fun and just out here sort of Peters channel if you haven't seen it Peters channel is the channel that I think like he brings a level of production quality to his work in his YouTube videos that there's not a lot of on this platform and I say kind of in jest that he's helping teach me how to vlog but I mean it like he is a he's a total practitioner when it comes to the act of photography and cinematography how do this is his vlogging camera it's not even a joke Peter's not he's no small youtuber Peters a very big youtuber he's very successful on the platform but if by chance you don't know of him or don't know of his work should definitely check it out it's below and he has like despite all the funny stuff he has genuinely like showed me a few of his tricks and how he achieves like the crazy production quality that his stuff has it's now heavy this is you could do it well you hold it by one of course better oh come on alright I'm try should we go return the bikes now yeah let's go take it back do you remember we're ready bikes home I think we go I think we go around but we have to hurry because the place is gonna close and then we're stuck with the bikes I miss the fall okay this is the coolest passport I've ever seen what what are these this is like yellow pages dude this is good what is that thank you Thanks so looking ahead what do you what do you hope to accomplish on YouTube what's the what's the master plan Peter I think master plan I just continue what I'm doing it's like the first time in my life I've been able to actually like work for myself and just have fun and like no limits so like maintaining that until the next thing grips me and I want to go after that 110 percent [Music]",

            "data": "you could hit this thing with a hammer and not break it [Music] [Applause] ready ah today's episode of tech review Tuesday we're gonna be asking one simple question which is which SmartWatch is the best SmartWatch [Music] and I do want to apologize for not having this week's tech review Tuesday intro complete dan who does the intros out of town will get to next week before I get into the specifics of each watch let me a little context so that is the SmartWatch spectrum on one end to be extreme is simply a watch this just tells the time doesn't know anything else they tell me the date just the time on the other end is a fully-fledged wrist computer and then the middle you have like a fitness sports focused watch and then what I think is probably the the best competitor to the Apple watch [Music] that's the spectrum now before I get into the intimacy's of each device there's another major factor to keep in mind as context when considering a SmartWatch and that is how much of a pain in the ass are they for what they give you in return and there is a very literal inversely proportional rationale to how much a SmartWatch can do versus how much you have to well how big of a how much of a pain in the ass it is [Music] so here is how the SmartWatch analysis will be taking place I'll be testing the watches build quality ecosystem capability and battery and this will include a regular watch watch the Garmin Phoenix five plus the Apple watch 444 millimeter and the big size galaxy watch now really the reason why I included a regular watch in this is because it's just sort of axes of control bibble quality first up on build is the Phoenix five plus the build quality is excellent on this thing it does have a crystal face like the Apple watch beyond that all the way around this is it's all stainless steel this is this is my old old one you see it's a little bit T it's a little bit scratched up a little bit weathered but these things are tough so overall they're good build quality on the on the garment now the series for Apple watch this thing is truly stunning like to hold in your hands does feel like you're holding a piece of jewelry look at that action smooth you could tell Johnny Ives just like polish this thing clean very impressed with the build quality of the Apple watch my previous Apple watch this is the generation 3 Apple watch it exploded I mean it literally exploded what I think happened to some salt water got under the screen battery expanded screen popped off but it's shattered these things are not built as tough as say a watch that looks like this the Apple watch is next up is the galaxy watch I will say the new galaxy watch has a certain heft to it it's stainless steel it feels dense compared to the old Galaxy gear watches it has a great weight to it it feels really solid the plat the bottom on this is plastic it does feel a little bit I don't know it feels less jewelry like and more electronics like when you when you feel that but it still has a substantial feel to it and the mechanics on it feel feel great here that the galaxy watch does have the weight of the stainless steel which is beautiful overall I've got to give it to the Phoenix 5 with the best build you can hit this thing with a hammer and not Fraser's just kidding next up is the ecosystem starting with our control watch this is just a watch it doesn't doesn't have an eco system there's no eco system none next up is the Phoenix 5 now you can download new watch faces on the app and I think you maybe download some apps for it and stuff but they're not super robust and a lot of the watch faces you can download are a little bit janky installing them is a little bit complicated so there is some ecosystem not a great ecosystem one thing it does well though for athletes is that the data that this collects does communicate with your other exercise apps like like straw or whatever it does that very well so that's kind of the only plus I would give this when it comes to ecosystem this is an area where the Apple watch really thrives and that ecosystem well it wasn't but after four years the ecosystem is now what you would expect from Apple and when you look to the new like heart rate features that this has the EKG features that this has I imagine that the ecosystem around this will only get more and more robust and the galaxy watch does have an impressive ecosystem this is a watch that's designed mainly for use with Android devices like your like your Galaxy Notes or whatever it is that you use but this doesn't use androids watch OS or whatever the hell it's called this uses a proprietary operating system that is owned by Samsung called Tizen Wow I think the operating system is really amazing on this it is limited in its its ecosystem because the only watches that carry it are these Samsung watches one caveat that I would say there about the Galaxy Watts it's kind of frustrating about the Apple watch is that the Apple watch doesn't allow third-party developers to design watch faces for it so it's pretty limited the galaxy watch does allow third-party developers to make faces for it so there's a broader selection here I don't know why Apple's so that's so limiting [Music] capability this is where I want to spend most of the times I think this is what differentiates these four devices see spoiler alert I don't know that I can say one is better than the other so really depends on what your needs are with that if you don't need a computer strapped to your wrist then you just get a damn watch you never have to think about it Ozzie tells you the time now if you want some smart capabilities well this is why I like the Garmin watch because for me it gives you the bare minimum of what you would kind of want so when you get a phone call it shows up on here you can't answer it on here you can't talk on here same with text messages it shows you the full text message on here beyond that when it comes to athletics I want my heart rate I want my my distance measured I want maps and and this does all of that and does that incredibly well so the capabilities on on this watch are vastly superior to just a regular old dumb watch but they aren't quite as robust is like a full-fledged smart watch this watch is basically a miniaturized iPhone strapped to your wrist and that could be a good thing or that could be a bad thing I will say historically I've gotten almost every I've gotten to I Apple watches before but I've stopped wearing both of them because it just ended up being too much on my wrist more than I wanted to deal with III didn't need all of that there when it was all in my pocket like I don't I don't know why this exists but I love this I can watch my own YouTube videos on this watch now that's a that's a third-party app that probably shouldn't exist but it does exist and I don't know I think that that's cool also for my capabilities perspective the operating system on the Galaxy watch I think is is certainly the best operating system any SmartWatch see because this is a round watch face when you bring up your apps like that you use this dial to navigate your apps and when you want to get into an app you just kind of tap it in the middle now comparing that the Apple watch where you do have a dial but it's this sort of is useful but touching and rotating this tiny little crown isn't quite as intuitive as having one here so judging the capabilities of these devices is very hard because quantity the amount of things it can do is less important to the user and how well it can do the few things that are important to you but the Garmin watch only does a few things but it does them incredibly well the Apple watch does a lot of things but much for how many of those things are going to actually use same with the galaxy watch does a lot of things but how many of those things am I gonna actually use and this really underscores what is kind of my conclusion on this whole thing when it comes to judging which box is best for you the first question is what do you need it for and then last up the easiest is battery life so a regular watch watch a quartz timed battery operated watch batteries last several years we'll just call that ever the single most impressive part about the Garmin is that this thing even though it has a full-color screen that's pretty low resolution and not that bright but a full color screen this battery depending on how much you use the GPS this battery will ask you two weeks if you use the GPS a lot it'll last you like five days the battery in this is incredibly impressive so much so that when I travel I typically don't bring the charger with me the Apple watch they say gets a full day I don't know why they're so modest about this I've only used it for a couple of days but so far I get way more than a full day it's not quite as good as the galaxy watch which gives you four days but I would say it's somewhere between the full day - advertised in the four days that this gives you [Music] so the conclusion here is that it's very very hard to objectively judge something like a SmartWatch because it has a lot less to do with the technical capabilities and far more to do with what exactly are you looking for in something that lives on your wrist I hate having to charge my cell phones every single day and one of the reasons why I've never stuck with the SmartWatch is because I hate having to also charge my watch every single day I also have a tendency to break everything everything I touch so the robustness of a watch is a big priority for me there's been a lot of chatter about the Apple watch I think it's deserving of most of that chatter because it is a very impressive device I do think this is the very best watch you could have on Android even though it doesn't run Android operating system so in conclusion which is best I don't know it really depends on what you want but what is exciting is that they're they're all pretty damn good I wouldn't underestimate these more simple athletic watches if you don't like the square on your wrist I wouldn't underestimate what the galaxy watch can do if you don't like carrying around a cell phone I wouldn't underestimate what a Smart Watch with an LTE chip in it could do I think we've arrived at a very interesting place with wearables and I'm excited about where they go next that is it for this week's tech Tuesday we'll see you back here next Tuesday with a great new intro from Dan mates [Music]",

printed it onto a sweatshirt this is a super high quality of luminol skateboard and on that skateboard my face shirt that says my name on it jacket it says my name on it look at the back ego a person's sense of self-esteem or self-important narcissism excessive or erotic interest in oneself and one physical appearance alright I think to be an artist or a painter or a filmmaker creator of any type it means your ego is so big you think that the rest of the world cares about your perspective but even a youtuber who has such a big ego that he makes videos about his life every day because he thinks people care even my ego isn't big enough for all of these awesome paintings of me these are amazing works of art that people have made something but I can't put a picture of myself up and I can't wear a sweatshirt with my face on it I'm just not comfortable with that so I had an idea [Music] today it's hard to breathe with us on today and the other thing my nose is too big for this today in the USA is red nose day red nose day is a day where a whole bunch of money is raised and it's raised to help underprivileged children and that's kids here in the USA in all 50 states and kids around the world who don't have what they need to live a happy and healthy and fulfilling life so here's an idea I linked below a Facebook fundraiser every dollar that's donated today before the end of the day on actually said the date wrong it's every dollar donated today through June 15th 2017 every dollar that's donated will be doubled by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation I'm going to make a donation and here's the thing don't donate a dollar and what I'm going to do is once the fundraiser is complete I will randomly contact people who have donated via Facebook to get in touch with them and see which of these artworks or t-shirts or sculptures or skateboards or or little clay sculptures of me they might be interested in if you're not interested in any of this crazy KC paraphernalia which I would understand well then at least you're donating a dollar or some money the kids really need help I got to go now last year I wore it all day but it really is like my nose is too big for a

scooter companies here ones called bird and ones called line this one's a line scooter what's the difference between a lines for the one it's faster straight up faster birds or slowest like birds are pretty much is like the bird I just mean my dad just gone on it's pretty cool though I'd say yeah it says your line s electric scooters require one dollar to a lock and they charge you by the minute as you ride rates and promotions may vary across different rates so that doesn't tell me how much of all right so I don't know exactly how much these things cost I couldn't find that information online but what I read is it's like about five bucks every half an hour it just depends so they charge you by the minute and the rates are fluctuating five bucks you know what do you think I'm in awesome really good they're everywhere you use them often in like fourth time using em I use them in San Diego like yesterday are you drifting your scooter [Music] it's not really a nice garage to boot the board all right so my my final thoughts on the scooter situation this is for both the lime scooters and the bird scooters I'm of two schools of thought here one is that for somebody who needs transport to get around they're amazing you just jump on you go they get you there but for everyone else who's not using the scooters they kind of make the city a like a messier place to be they're not pleasant the whole idea seems very half-baked it's a half-baked because yes great way to get people around it's part absolute chaos because like the aspect of where you keep these things and how to not get them in everyone's way and just myriad other sort of logistical parts feels totally like no consideration but ultimately I think they're good because I use them and I I think there are very interesting glimpse into a future where like it's not required where there's like a shared transport that doesn't require a car or a bus and it's awesome it's awesome hey max what do you think of the like bird scooters and the lime scooters scooters in general I think there are menace to society and they need to be stopped at all Carly no I mean I get what's cool about them but like as someone who lives around here there's so many times we're like I'm just walking out of a store or like my dog is running out of a store and a scooter like almost runs him over or me and like they're just tourists who have no idea what the hell they're doing here and they're like they're veering off the path they're going the wrong way down the bike path I mean it's just it's it's a mess it's a mess it's dangerous someone's gonna lose an eye and it's all gonna be over [Music] all right so we spent the last 30 or 40 minutes I don't know if I should have been doing this or I'm gonna get in trouble for doing this but I was sharing with max the rough cuts of the Shawn Mendes documentary so he gave me some meaningful feedback because it's still a work in progress all right broadly what are your thoughts I think that this is the best video I've ever seen case you made are you saying let me say that a different way okay okay this is are you both know I think that this is really fantastic this is really great I almost like it more than the adventure and the surprise in South Africa that's one of my greatest that that one that one gets me but this this is real solid man I can't reach it job it's not me it's it's Zach and Brett and me it's the teamwork but thanks for the feet I got to go I got to go back to New York now by Maxie [Music]",

exterior of 368 absolutely absolutely beautiful this was not from either of my two children but I appreciate this nonetheless in case you revived in have you the Father's Day present your friends at fatherly and Gillette this is not a paid whatever I wasn't aware I had friends at Gillette but thank you for this lovely razor and shaving cream house time with her wife going man oh it's great so

website and stuff like that today is that once a year day what are you wearing [Music] yeah the extension cord I never understand people's willingness to endure and struggle through something we make and just solve the problem whap it why would you not just solve the problem and install it's not that complicated just stick it in the window you know all right look it in four minutes problem solved Hey ac number two is in I didn't know you're coming back you call me okay so this is Terrell we're just talking about being a model in New York City now isn't just about being the best looking you're like having the best energy yep but that you have to have a certain amount of social media followers to get booked that's that's definitely a true fact because I've definitely multiple bookings such I think it's Macy's you need um pink 30,000 they won't even book you without ya like you need like the followers influence over life people of our age group especially since I'm 22 so okay so I think that's bull so what I'm going to do is I'm going to link your Instagram handle right there so you can get the job with Macy's oh what's your count now here let me see your feet okay so Carly jor-el has 4815 followers this will be an interesting looks pair and look at these great photos what's a yo if it does go the remainder of this photo shoot is taking place in the roof all the girls here from

hopefully okay yeah bye honey she's five months pregnant and runs two companies you know my wife and I were both footballs to take our work very seriously that's the glue that binds us [Music] are we doing tattoos are we gonna do tattoo review Tuesday because I can't feel tech review Tuesday today because the Sony camera never showed up okay tattoo review Tuesday are you down Tuesday Tuesday okay I talked about doing tattoos in the window of 360 is our first art installation this is Jeremy he's a tattoo artist and just a regular artist Jeremy Oh Jeremy and I used to work together but I had to fire him because we look too much alike [Music] [Music] miss you I'm in a circus okay this is the first cities philosophy okay this is the first contact go one of these why are we doing touching you say is this your idea my idea your idea do you make this me this morning tattoo Tuesday [Music] didn't always turn see the idea with this front space at three six eight there's not two just have like a retail outlet where we sell t-shirts but they have it'd be like an active there's always something going on and that's why we're gonna start with Jeremy having is like tattoo parlor here and then they'll be an area over there where you can't actually buy stuff it's a way of having a part of three six eight be interactive with the public and open to the public when is this am I making any sense yeah these canals just waiting for you to say there's gonna be a skate trap the public that's never for the public that's for us I'm sorry that the legalities of having a public skate park okay so all that's left now is the bit that goes onto my hand and onto my finger and we are done brace yourself for this rose water the fingers painful [Music] all right so this tattoo that says New York City's summer 2018 and really I just drew this in like two seconds on a cardboard box over there and Jeremy put it on my arm but the reason why I got this is like all of my tattoos are sort of notes that capture like a moment in my life I've made a movie about this it's linked below and summer 2018 is like the last summer where before Kinison I have another kid it's the last time with just one baby in the house it's maybe even my last summer where I live in New York City it's the first summer where I started 368 it's the first summer where the Dan was here and this is just it just feels like I really I really like this year has been a inflection point like a turning point in my whole life and this is just a way to capture that moment forever I'll see you back from my trip a French I'll see you in a week [Music] [Music]",

recognize this this pattern we always get these hot couple of days in September and then that's it and then BOOM it's October and it's freezing so I'm not complaining about this weather I love this weather I cherish this weather and I appreciate it soon and I'll be running in a winter coat instead of running without a shirt on so very happy very happy today ninety degrees out I'm gaming monitors here I mean for one it doesn't really fit on the destined for - it's all can't figure out the formatting hey can you come help me set up my gaming situation ok ok I'll see you I don't know what I'd do without that guy you know I almost got it set up but like it's like 32 by 9 aspect ratio or something and this gonna happen or should I just give up no it's done I did it it should work but the resolution is fixed the game will look epic on this obnoxious like you can't even you can't see the whole thing in one glance alright let me explain what's going on this is like this is a sponsored video we're doing a project with EA around battlefield 5 which is launching soon wait is the game gonna fill the whole screen it should shut and we're in we're in the open access right now multiplayer 5 days left ok let's say anything we're doing a big project with them but right now we're just gonna try to get the game of work but also I just realize you don't have speakers in here let me get speakers let me get speakers Rael I'm in a proper game right now you just die you're logged into my my account you want to try a terrible gamer I'm the worst gamer I'll see you I'll see you so where it gets really into work gets really interesting is over in 368 looks like a storms are brewing out here [Music] I just uh I just wanted to sit up here for the the Vantage so you get a better look of what this space looks like so here's what we're doing we are building down here not like a proper tournament space because we don't have the real estate for that but we're building for for Saturday for tomorrow just like a four-person kind of like practice space and ultimately we'll build this out so it's an eight or sixteen person practice space or gaming space down here but for Saturday we're racing to do a four-person gaming space game and because we're working with EA directly on this they're bringing in a couple of gamers we're gonna be streaming from down here it'll be the first time the 368 gaming space is used and because this is like sponsored by EA and we're doing this with EA it's a it's a big thing I think there's gonna be 64 different gamers on a single server all over the world though and we'll all be competing against one another which is cool but what's even cooler is the fact that we're doing it out of three six eight the hard part of all this is getting this space ready by Saturday [Music] this is all gonna be linked below but if you want to follow along the streams me Saturday at 10:00 a.m. California time which is 1:00 p.m. New York time where it's all below in the description [Music] what day next week is the activation it would be good is if you like give me a tattoo for this scene as I'm talking about okay all right so all right so this is the three six eight store right here this is where like last week's video you saw me in here selling t-shirts we've been working hard to open this space and we're going to open it to the public I think one day next week we have something called the sidewalk permit which means it's kind of expensive you have to pay for days where's new one day I'll let you know what day and on that day in addition to like selling whatever crap we can come up with Jeremy here is going to set up a tiny it's more of an art installation but like a tattoo parlor right here in this window right so yeah tattoos okay so let me explain how it works it's really good okay Jeremy every time okay so here's how it works Jeremy is gonna make a selection of drawings like his little drawings and then we have a website I'll link it is it alive I'll link it below you like go on there you look at his drawings and then you sign up to come get attached it all tattoos are 100 bucks even because that just seems right you can only pick one of Jeremy's drawings do you pick where it goes no they can pick where it goes no face tattoos right no face tattoos no face unfortunately you only do a couple a day but it's still dope yeah it'll be fun and then secretly not secretly like today when you're seeing this video three people today as like as you're seeing this video can come in and get a tattoo I'll link the site below I'm sure they'll already be three dudes lined up but like that's the plan and again it's not about turning three six eight into like a tattoo parlor Jeremy's just a rad street artist rad tattoo artist and we're like [Music] tomorrow notepaper you're gonna be behind here and you even have a peanut gallery out here watching you tattoo is that cool you know last week I made a video about ambition and doing too much and not knowing when to say no and it's just like last night we did that serious lightly last night we did that Taco Tuesday which was a small deal but it was also a big deal too as a first and then even tomorrow Jeremy's a little tight to experiment again a small deal but it's a first and then next week we're opening up the space to the public that's a first this thing we're doing with EA and Battlefield five on Saturday tomorrow that's a first and all of this is culminating like all this is happening at the same time that Candice just keeps like inching closer to the due date the baby is doing like I think for four weeks in two days right now it's just a lot and I couldn't be more excited I couldn't be happier I think the feeling right now is one of being totally overwhelmed and I think the only thing you can do when you feel overwhelmed is just keep going and that's the plan what's good [Music]",

            "data": "[Music] [Laughter] [Music] this is the DJI spark come DJI spark 5 combo fly more combo pack this is the official DJI spark I did do an earlier video about the spark but that was with a prototype unit this is the official shippable unit as it will appear in stores biggest detail here in this box is the controller for the spark now for this video we comparing the sparks with the controller to the DJI Mavic with controller I do want to make it abundantly clear before I begin this review that I'm not being paid by a I've never been paid 5 DJI this is an impartial review but I'm a huge fan of DJI so it's sort of like a little bit bias because I like the product so much first the unboxing documentation this is the actual drone battery extra propellers solar propeller guard charger AC adapter the charger that's everything the bag yet the case yet the drone itself eight I think eight propeller blade or propeller guards you get the charger and get two batteries and I think it maybe even comes with an SD card this is six hundred ninety nine bucks seems like a good deal now one interesting kid that I did want to zero in on be consisting is all about portability is this is the case it comes with this is the case you need for the battery for the charger for the controller for everything this is the case that the Mavic prompted now the Mavic is a considerably bigger drone them the spark but at the end of the day you need all this stuff with you so you're carrying it all in the case matter case spark case they're almost the same size they're going to take up almost the same amount of real estate in your backpack that's an interesting consideration okay let's get into this then this is the controller for the DJI spark and this is a controller for the Maverick both extremely similar looking devices I will say this one feels the spark one feels a little bit lighter and like maybe a little bit cheaper feeling and the spark does not have this LED readout the nabek controller does have now without having actually use this yet I can tell you the LED readout is not super critical because you always use these controllers of the phone information presented on this LED readout is redundant to the phone not entirely necessary I think they put it on the Maverick because they intended for people to use the controller without a phone but who wants that you can't see the picture to lay out the same buttons are the same got these great little x-wing fighter arms here and that's where you stick and that's where you stick the phone I do want to say as a very strong aside DJ I made a lot of fuss about the fact that you can control these and they're fully operational using justa phone you can also use hand controls things like that I think that's great whatever it feels a little bit like a gimmick to me I want to use a drone to take beautiful aerial cinematography whether it's a tiny drone or a big drone and when you just have a phone you're trying to use essentially buttons that have this kind of tactical feedback you're trying to emulate that using nothing but a touchscreen it's imprecise on top of it being harder to control because of the lack of buttons and this is a really big deal when you're using your phone it's nothing more than the Wi-Fi signal from your phone so the range is severely limited every time I use the spark using just my phone it was never able to get more than really like 70 or 80 feet away from me now in the box here are these propeller guards they attach on something like this propeller guards are really great for two things that if you're a total novice a total beginner they will protect your drone and two if you're flying indoors in really tight quarters they'll also be helpful there and not really for me though [Music] for the extra light test I'm going to go outside to a more open safe location but now I've had this spark prototype for a few months one aspect of the sparked it's sort of hard to capture the review like this is how quiet and discreet it is even thematic when you fire that thing up it does a super fit and it acts a crowd and then it grew loud but the spark is quiet and small and somewhat innocuous people see it as a toy instead of a my single favorite feature of the spark and this may seem silly but this is a big deal for me is the fact that you can just plug a microUSB cable into the spark itself in charge of the battery portable battery charger plug it in this thing is charging right now that's a big deal it can be charging in my backpack alright so this is me setting up the controller for the DJI spark for the first time you have to go into your phone and like literally connect to the Wi-Fi it doesn't say the password button below the password to the Wi-Fi perfectly Wi-Fi password is located under the stickers that are basically inaudible okay I think I've got it just you know that took me 20 minutes to figure out that whole setup process was confusing and frustrating and took a long time but I'm hoping maybe that's just because it was the first time that I did it now at a time for a long awaited flight test now what I'm going to try and do is do some complicated but beautiful cinematography with the drone and then try to replicate that cinematography with thematic compare the two shot so cute [Music] this looks really good [Music] all right I do have to say responsive responsiveness feels fantastic the image preview quality that you get on the screen right here is dynamite my complaints about radio versus Wi-Fi are unfounded it's really really good and the drone is way the hell out there one of the biggest technical hurdles of the spark versus the phantom or any of the other DJI drones is that this only shoots in 1080 that's the highest resolution thematic issue ting natively in 4k now if you're watching this back on a cell phone you might not be able to tell but watch it back in 4k on a big monitor you'll be able to see the difference and it's it's significant [Music] okay despite all my bitching about that Wi-Fi nonsense that was pretty incredible I think it way further than I had expected the image quality on this thing was amazing and [Music] all right so in conclusion biggest concerns with this were around it's like fly ability how easy is it to control in the air because on the phone they kind of suck using the controller it's perfect it's ace it's everything I wanted it's incredible controls are tight they're if they're specific it's responsive it does exactly what you want it to do it just kind of leaves one big question which is the million dollar or a 300 Oller question which is for $6.99 for the whole package do you get this or for 9.99 to get the whole package of the mavet and I think it if you're a novice if you're new to drone this is the way to go save the money and this thing is amazing if you've had any experience or you have bigger aspirations for what you can do with the drone spend the extra money get the Mavic you won't have any regrets both so are great options for drones and I will never stop being impressed and just how tiny you give me [Music]",

total solar eclipse it was amazing but a lot of people have been asking how did I shoot the actual scene when the Eclipse happen because I had a lot of coverage so I thought I would explain first you should know I had five cameras shooting simultaneously while the Eclipse took place two of those cameras were flying cameras first the perfect overhead shot about five minutes where the eclipse took place I sent a phantom for like this straight up in the air about 1,500 feet above the ground where I was standing camera pointed straight down like this then I set the location to lock so it wouldn't move too much and I hit record and then I just kind of forgot about a second camera the one that went over the crowd just as it got dark that was this custom Casey Neistat Mavic right here setting a trajectory on the app minute it got dark I just hit start through the controller so this thing went by itself third camera that was that wide-angle sping time-lapse shot I got that by putting a gopro hero4 on an egg timer I could Sony t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t and that's why in the last shot of the video when you see me pull this thing down you can actually hear the egg timer fourth shot that's the shot of the Sun staring directly into the Sun that was done using the camera that I'm actually filming this on right now which is a Panasonic Lumix gh2 h5 with a long lens on it and then I put a little sunglasses over the lens to create a filter and film the Sun I had to remember to lock focus and lock exposure before I hit record camera number five was like the can I talked into was like the main vlogging camera and that was this year Sony rx100 mark 5 this I use because it has the best low-light and I knew no matter how dark it got that this thing would give me like a consistent rock-solid image plus the big camera here was busy shooting the Sun and that is how one person shoots with five cameras to get five angles to capture a minute and 44 seconds of totality are you telling me that you built a time machine yeah that was Austin Texas for the South by Southwest Film Festival 2008 [Applause] it was a big day what was taking place there's my friends Josh and Benny safty that's Josh Casey Benny they made this movie I sort of helped them make it I organized the funding for it for that they bestowed me with an executive producer credits but this was us premiering the movie at a film festival for the first time how do you feel about this screening we word nerve it was it was a great movie those guys made a great we made a great movie but this was a tiny tiny theater that there weren't that many people there hey Jeffy is that look that was a really big deal for us Josh and Benny those two guys they're two of my oldest friends there are two people that have motivated and inspired me as a filmmaker my whole life I'm talking about them now because they have a huge feature-length like big time movie that's coming out in all the movie theaters this weekend that's where they started guys ready and they made it they did it their movie that comes out this weekend starts Robert Pattinson that that's huge really handsome movie star those guys did it we used to make movies together when this is what a video camera look like hey Casey say hi hey hey I'm not being paid for this or anything they're just my friends I love those guys in any promotion I could help them with I would do as if that isn't enough to celebrate who produced their new smash hit feature-length movie my dear friend Oscar Oscar is one of the first people that ever worked for my brother and me and we hired him the day after he moved to New York City when he was like 21 or something this video is him opening his Christmas presents from Van and me I know it looks like a lot of money that is like less than one week's pay those were all one dollar bills a movie is called good time directed by the sastras that's Josh and Benny produced by Oscar boysson Oscar how did you go from being my assistant to a famous big-time movie producer just by never taking no for an answer kind of following believing I could do anything which I learned in the nice dad studio alright seriously this guy would just over and over again I'd never seen anything like it you just say you're smart figure it out you're smart figure it out you're smart figure it out I don't care how long it takes just make it beautiful and that sounded a little weird at the time because you're used to work in a restaurant or being a landscaper but it's actually really empowering and it took me a while to figure that out and the more movies I made the more I realized it didn't matter it kind of applies to everything Oscar how did you get Robert Pattinson of Twilight Fame to star in this movie two years ago about two years ago today Robert Pattinson saw an image from a movie that I also produced that Josh and Benny also directed and he emailed Josh and Benny and said I want to do whatever you guys are doing next so Robert Pattinson came to you came to Josh and Danny to be in this movie or a movie yeah and Josh said be careful because when we say we're going to do something we actually do it which is not something that happens the movie business very often I want to bring up the Rotten Tomatoes oh yeah Rotten Tomatoes here Game of Thrones their movies opening this week look at this look at this look at this good time 90% that's more than all these other movies that's kind of it for my plug for good time I'll end this by saying this is not a movie for children there's gratuitous violence there's drug use there's profanity but it is the movie that the young aspiring filmmaker version of me well yeah so psyched I would have seen it and said I want to make it look like a Martin Scorsese movie from the 1970s if that means anything to you okay last detail if you are in New York City tomorrow if you're in New York City August 24th 2017 we're what are we doing like hosting a screening Oscar

            "data": "so this is not like a regular episode this is more like me sharing a story with you that I want to share with you it's not that it's like sad sad but it's not a super happy or fun story I just wanted to give you forewarning if you're expecting like a fun jubilant blog just come back tomorrow but if you want to hear this more kind of sentimental I guess a little bit a little bit sad of the story well then you're in the right place but this does start out fun it starts out being a fun episode so here okay so this was like a week ago this is before Dan left for South Africa thank you very much see you later be okay I'm just leaving town and I thought maybe I should bring you something is it donuts it's better ah dude get well then I'll see you in a couple of days so today is a road trip day I've got a very very long like what is it six-hour leave six hour and 32 minute drive from New York City up to Vermont where my grandmother is not funeral funeral is instead of a funeral she's having the whole family get together to celebrate her life and there's gonna be like 30 or 40 of us there so I'm sad but I'm also very excited to see my family when I'm not excited about is this dry it's kind of a bummer that Franny and Candice didn't come I understand why they didn't want to sit in the car for seven hours it was smart Candice's it's too pregnant way too pregnant to be in the car and then nobody I didn't have anybody else to go with me so today is a day of solidarity focused in and sitting in my car watching it drive me to Vermont there it is so now I've got about 40 half an hour 40 minutes to kill the shopping mall actually I'm buying a tie for the funeral I'd neglected to bring one so this is fortuitous stop [Music] quick bite to eat now I think the car is probably close to charge I'm back in the car getting it washed I got a full tank of battery I've got I had a food I'm good I'm ready to drop is awesome I'm ready to drive there is one tiny little concern though it is way way further than I thought I mean not like a little bit for the like significantly as in it's 9 o'clock at night I've been driving with traffic like six hours I'm not even halfway there long story long I got a long long night of driving ahead of me [Music] that was kind of all I shot of the whole weekend of getting there see I got to the hotel where my family my whole extended family was staying we got there like 1:00 in the morning I saw my sister we shared a room and I just I decided at that moment that I wanted this trip to be just like purely about being present and being around my family it felt especially relevant because we were there to sort of celebrate the life of my grandmother but I just I didn't pick the camera up again until I left [Music] that's my sister there that's me and my sister so the reason why I wanted to make this video or just what I kind of wanted to share for posterity was my take away from this whole from the whole funeral from the whole family get together see we woke up the next morning if we went to the cemetery in the whole sad part and then and then that night we had this is the night of the funeral we had this big like dinner get together in a room it's sort of like a wedding reception is what it felt like and after we all finished our lasagna one after another my aunts and my uncles and my cousins they all kind of started to stand up and tell stories about my grandmother that's my grandmother and that that's my grandfather that's my mom and that's her mom my grandmother my grandmother my Nana kept a journal of every day of her life and so many your stories shared from my aunts and uncles were directly from that journal they could go back to literally any day in her life and and recall what happened that's my that's my that's my grandmother that's my uncle I'm not sure which one am i laughter that is that's me again my mom her side of the family my maternal side of the family I had eight aunts and uncles or seven Anse and uncles in one mom so my mother is one of eight kids these are them that's seven of them anyways I think that's my mom right there that's my uncle my uncle yeah I I knew that they struggled like my mom always talked to us about how they had powdered milk when they were kids because they couldn't afford like regular milk that comes in a jug they would buy powder and mix it with water and that was the milk that they got [Music] then my aunt started reading off journal entries and there was a couple that were short and there's a couple that were like I went to bed hungry tonight because we all the kids ate because we only had enough food for the kids or there was one that was something like feeling terrible I didn't have enough food for Lee that was her husband my grandfather maybe tomorrow will be different there were there were a lot of those kinds of moments that just painted such a vivid portrait of what of what my grandmother's life was like like raising eight kids and it's hard for me to imagine this whatever was 50 years ago 60 years ago but it just that night there would the family made it so real and so palpable I don't know it's weird I was felt more affected by my grandmother than in those moments that I did in my whole life of knowing her and physically being around her [Music] the model my dad and my brother and cousins and no no no that guy is cousin cousin and cousin there's Nana right there that's me with my cousins and my brothers this is where I lived in a in a trailer park see I live like I think I think right there and that's my grandmother that's my mom that's my dad that's me and that's my baby boy Owen he's big now but that's always [Music] I know I got up to say something I didn't have a fun anecdote from my grandmother's life but when I stood up I just wanted to thank her and acknowledge how special of a thing it was that her the last thing she did on earth before she died was to set aside the money and the resources and everything to have the whole family come together like this amazing trip was her doing and what a special special thing that was to have to have to have us remember her by it was special [Applause] [Music] [Music] well I made it back great trip of really just amazing time with the family [Music] [Music] [Music]",

            "data": "[Applause] Hey hey did you finish the tech Tuesday intro I need it for today's episode [Music] drones drones drones drones drones drones drones when you talk about drones you really talk about one brand and that one brand is DJI [Music] pji just dominates the market with hit drones like the spark and the Mavic air and me when consumers youtubers people like me think of buying a drone this is what's generally thought of and that's despite there being a number of interesting competitors that have come to the market like the GoPro drone which is an interesting device because it was dynamic you could take the camera out and mount it on your chest then there are other devices like like this sky do drone which is a start up their tracking technology is amazing but difficult to justify several thousand dollars when for several hundred dollars you can get one of these which which in a lot of ways is superior to the several thousand dollar one but just today I received a drone in the mail from a company I had never heard from the drone company I'd never heard of and they pitched it to me as a DJI competitor this this is the GD uo2 drone let's unbox [Music] I'm waiting for the battery to charge some initial thoughts on the GDU o2 now when you open the box you're greeted by these two things the controller and the drone it feels a little cheap but I know better than to judge a book by its cover you have 4k video obstacle avoidance 20 minutes of flight time just sort of what's expected from a small drone okay alright enough yapping go test this thing where there's a safe place to fly these things that stand behind me Sam is a tech aficionado and it's here to consult on whether this GDU - is worth the damn or not yeah better is that better alright so I'm not gonna do any big sweeping dramatic shots because I don't think you're supposed to out here better do a low flight and really focus on testing two things that is flight control how easy is it to fly in an image quality how pretty is the picture that it yields before I send this in the air one quick comparison with the Maverick air just uh both folding drones alright I'm going to start with the Mavic air as sort of a controls who have something to compare the GDU o2 to [Music] [Applause] [Music] nicely done okay here we go this is the takeoff of the DD you see a man quality doesn't look bad based on what I'm seeing on the phone the flight control though is very wishy-washy it feels like what try to DJ I was several years ago on top of that there's major connection issues I can see the drone it's about 60 feet from me yet I've lost connectivity three times it's a big deal when you're flying these drones [Music] I lost it I watched it crash like right over there there was no control what so it did you see it I watched you just did a dive bomb I mean it was you know I'm only flying about 10 15 feet over the water here for safety and I'm fly over the water to be saved and the thing just we see if we can get it I'd see it make together he gets gone did you see it he's got a poor one out for that drone did you see it though father and son say they heard it and just hit the water and that's kind of it it's in the water what are you laughing how much of you my review now I'm no expert drone pilot I've crashed more drones and I've successfully flown but this was really basic flight and the thing just took off you saw I watched it just zipped and then just went just heal and then that was the end of that no sign of it before I sent the drone up in the air I said to camera image quality and flight controls are what I'd be testing and the failure that was the GDU tests flight I think is solely to blame on the flight control itself flight control by the way is like this software it's what how you interact with the drone as it's fly when you pilot a drone you're like operating a vehicle that is up in the air and any sense of disconnection is like so nerve-racking for me there's so many things that can go wrong and today was one of those days I'm mostly just frustrated cuz I don't even know if I can call this a tech review I don't have the footage from the drift out of today guru welcome Dan good to see you and I don't even know if I can call us a tech review because I don't have the footage to compare against the other what happened I hate to give like a really strong negative review about something but why would you spend the same amount of money on something that's that's an inferior product all the way around went for the same dollar amount you could get something that is superior on all levels DJ I'm DJ I doesn't pay me I just think they make great products I want to do a test with some so that you know that did you see yesterday's video where um look it's literally called instant regret why would you do this it's got six point four million on the scoville scale I don't want to do this right now - no you did you eat - I ate two of them you did eat - I may - if you you can eat I'm going to write this do it do it come on choo choo choo choo choo choo dude he's tough he's touch he made it something is such a big deal watch it watch it go happily it's like I'm not gonna cry it's like the hottest Kyle I can't even talk dude it hurts man youtube.com slash youtube.com slash Sam Shepard I'll see you there good luck Sam",

            "data": "that was in uh I was in a I was in Denver Colorado yesterday man what an incredible city that is [Music] alright Denver Colorado it's freezing great to be here dart I I love this thing this is why I'm here for Denver startup week I'm speaking at I'm speaking at Denver startup week entrepreneurs small businesses a lot of excited people amazing event but Denver Denver's one of those cities that I could see myself living in it's it's incredible here ok I got a small problem a small problem I'd like to discuss with you in the spring of 2015 in one of the early episodes of season 1 of the vlog I opened a package on camera it's our new coffee machine and this began mail time this is a really funny book by the way couple years it all falls into one of two categories first category is companies small companies big companies companies like shred lights they're sending me free products like lights cuz they want me to talk about their company and what their products are the second kind of mail that I get and this is my favorite my favorite kind of mail are just like packages and letters from people we're just writing to say hi and like and cool stuff like that and sometimes they send me really cool stuff too now here's the problem the problem is I've just got I've got too much stuff look at normally this is a couch here this is where I have meetings is on my couch there's no couch there's just boxes and then more boxes and then more boxes and more boxes and these boxes all these boxes here in my studio right now this is just like from like this weekend last weekend whatever I have a whole nother studio where my office manager Patrick works right there and then my friend Sam shares his space this is his desk but primarily what this entire space is used for is what's on the upper level here and well now now this and I mean all of this stuff here all this stuff this is all stuff that people have sent me over the years and I mean like everything up here is perfectly meticulously organized like skateboards look at look at these skateboards look at this skateboard it's got me on it that's incredible how about a complete skateboard here's a complete skateboard tiny skateboard tinier skateboard big skateboard bigger skateboard skateboard that's shaped like a surfboard funny shaped skateboard but my skateboard rattling hold for skateboards and I have four skateboards in fact in fact I had to build a little thing on top of my umbrella holder here to hold one two more skateboards I need a spot for my little skateboards something someone made for me put it Tyla trees toys shoes clothing light bulbs more shoes pillows blankets and bags but look I have a second a second pillows and blankets been over here blankets pillows cups and posters lilies cups how about a helmet jacket or backpack a mattress television these garbage bags are completely filled up with clothing like t-shirts and hats and sweaters and pants Andy thank you for sending me this shirt really well-designed I really appreciate it I literally have 75 t-shirts at home then two garbage bags over here filled up with unworn t-shirts I don't know what to do with all these t-shirts there are 100 comments below they're like Casey you ungrateful mother fine people sent you that stuff you should show some appreciation I appreciate it immensely and please know that every single person who sends me anything whether it's a one of these letters in the box or somebody sends me a big present or a small present or just a note that says hello every single person gets a response I send everybody stickers and then see all of these up here those are my binders where I save your letters I catalog them I date them and then I put them up there for reference for all of eternity I appreciate every single thing that's ever been sent to me but I still find myself in a position of extreme abundance to have an abundance of food and snacks because I eat all the candy and then whatever weird stuff that I don't want I just give to Oscar hey hey man is Oscar in so I find myself in this position of trying to figure out what to do with all of this stuff and you know living in New York City space is a premium here and it's like I don't want to get rid of anything because I appreciate it so much for the same time it's just kind of sitting in my office over there that I'm paying rent on that's collecting dust so what should I do is the million dollar here Casey we know you like skateboards two guys grew up in Hawaii this is a five foot tall skateboard and it's awesome and I appreciate it and thank you I just don't know where to put it [Music] as come on now in the past I have donated some of the toys to charities who give toys to kids I've donated a bunch of the clothes to places where you can donate clothing and then what I really like to do is when somebody I know or sort of know needs something I just send them all this extra stuff okay seen I said and told him about my nonprofit heroes reading heroes Tomasz blown up hashtag grenade legs I'm gonna share with you the goodies mr. nice that decided to send me Chris was a US soldier knee at his legs blown up in Iraq he wants to make youtube videos but isn't have any camera gear so I sent him a whole box of stuff and a lot of that stuff and a lot of it was stuff that people had sent me that I wasn't using so I was able to pass on to him so I'm looking for something that's more scalable that does something good that here's what I came up with all right so here here's the plan I'm going to be launching an eBay store do you call an eBay store an eBay I'm gonna sell everything that everyone's ever sent me that I don't have a use for or someone else I can give it to then I'm gonna take all those proceeds and I mean every penny like every cent that's leftover that we didn't use on shipping every cent and I'm gonna give it all to whatever nonprofit I feel needs it the most at any given the current situation I have too much male stuff the answer the current situation is to store all the stuff in garbage bags this accomplishes absolutely nothing now the new way current situation the same too much male stuff but the answer is to sell it on ebay what does this accomplish well the stuff this stuff goes to people who will actually use it instead of just store it like me and then the proceeds the proceeds will help those in the most need via charities and things like that so for this first run of stuff that I'm going to sell all the proceeds for that are gonna go to a couple of charities all linked below all of which are currently helping people in Puerto Rico just ravaged by a hurricane three plus million people without power down there they're in the most need right now so I'm going to donate all the cash made from selling all this stuff to help those people I hope this doesn't discourage anyone from sending me anything I do appreciate the mail I try to open as much as I can on camera and I especially appreciate the gadget because it gives me like good content we need to review gadgets like whatever this thing is now I'm gonna pivot this episode for me talking about male solutions to a tech review of [Music] number one motorized bicycle look at this well well so far I like it a lot [Applause] [Music] hey Mira Vasco da Stern yeah can you come test this electric bike with me of course yeah do you want to ride this for the skateboard [Music] hey old life expectations Oscar I mean based on the hallway test I think we're I'm excited to see how this thing goes on the outside so what folds up yeah I don't know much about I couldn't find the manual top speed don't know it's turning ability supply oh geez I guess the question becomes Oscar could you see this as a viable means of transportation in New York City I feel vulnerable on it I feel a little anxious about hurting someone else for the right kind of person you know if you're maybe not is like you don't enjoy the exercise that comes along with a bike it might work [Music] my biggest beef is there's nowhere to put your feet I think that's what this is for your feet are supposed to go here but they don't really organically fall there let's look at some of the features of this thing the center stand here telescoping foot pads or disc brakes yup front disc brake seat there is suspension up front LED display here new york sides it's something you could've in your apartment I mean if I look half as cool as I feel Oscar this thing seems like a home run how I always imagined you [Music] I think we're really asserting some street presence the amazing have a street gang with like a dozen of us and leathers and chaps you know I do he's proud to see the horn everybody yields I found a weakness it's up no power thanks a lot you like this one [Music] this is a steal ability deal ability test alright go no problem dude alright so all in all the review of the hover 1 bicycle is that it's pretty good I don't know what this costs are what the range is but by the time I edit this I will have googled it and I'll put it right here on the screen for me it's still tough that anything that they can compare with the boosted board also always wear a helmet also I'll see you tomorrow here on the block [Music]",

            "data": "do you look cold on its ever do you look like a nerd I think you look like a badass dude [Music] [Music] a lot of people have been asking about my bike so let's talk about my bike [Music] today's tick review cheese never advised me to travel back in time I've always sought means of transportation that are different from likes public transportations subways too noisy and crowded buses are too slow calves are too expensive drying is impractical walking this doesn't cover enough distance now if you've watched this vlog you know that my favorite means of transport are my boosted boards so I have so many of them a couple weeks ago I got one of these bikes it's called the super 73 and it's really really interesting a little history on the super 73 the parent companies called lithium cycles and they launched as a Kickstarter in 2016 they started shipping these bikes I want to say in early 2017 or late 2016 it's a very cool company they work with a lot of youtubers and they sent me two bikes one for Candice and one for me kind of thought I'd be like a joke that would sit in the corner of my office this thing's kind of taken over and it's the first means of transport in New York City in whatever 2 or 3 years that has started to make inroads competing with my boosted board for my favorite way to get around and now a closer look at the bike [Music] right before Dan and I can actually shoot the out in the street version of this I have to have Sam teach me how to use the stabilizer and this all that totally said one secret stabilizer package for mr. nice dad yeah it holds the ATD with like the super small lenses it's really useful you think you can handle it I don't know I'm scared of like riding and shooting but it holds the camera really well yeah sort of like a double tap are you Tuesday you mount it on the bottom here and then there's a bunch of different axes to balance locked and twisted ready to go so it's neat is if you want to get the super low drop down shot you turn it over like this and then you can like really get super low to the ground and this is like ultra ultra stable shots yeah [Music] riding a regular boat gotta watch out for potholes yeah be careful of cars gotta be up guys gotta be mindful of the handlebars sitting in between other car most importantly you have to obey traffic laws [Music] so this thing at three what is this we're just pedaling like a madman it's not bad but it's kind of a heavy bike to just pedal number two number two something called pedal assist and basically what that means is after you pedal the motor are you doing as you pedal the motor picks up and takes off for you it's like you have super muscled superhuman superhero power and your legs like watch I'm totally white already watch me take off later [Music] and in the lifeboat [Music] survive [Music] [Music] one advantage this thing has over other electric bikes and bikes in general is it can handle off-roading like grass dirt gravel really well ready [Music] so there's a lot to like about this and and the reason why I think that this thing is kind of brought bikes back into my life in New York City is just cuz of how dynamic it is I put that milk crate on the back so now I can haul a bunch of things the range on its further than my skateboard it's faster than a regular bicycle I don't get all sweaty I do feel a little bit safer on a bike that I do on a skateboard but there are concerns with riding an electric bike in a city like New York for example up until a month ago electric bikes were completely outlawed did you know that it wasn't like as in January they completely out as of October of last year mayor de Blasio mayor of New York City said no more power-assist no more electric bikes so if cops saw you on a bike like that they immediately take the bike away and they give you an up to a $500 fine now as of April 8th of this year like five weeks yes about a month ago exactly actually to the day a month ago exactly today the mayor announced that that he's pulling that back and now bikes are okay if they're power-assist as in they pedal as well which this does so once again this bike is legal but these are kind of the concerns when you're on something that looks like that instead of a traditional bicycle but there is one factor that the super 73 has and maybe just as new but the fun factor I think is higher on this bike than maybe any other vehicle ever ridden in the city would would you agree it's so much fun it's so much fun [Music] one thing you consider though if you live in a city and you have a bike like this is if you leave it outside it's going to get stolen so you gotta take it in [Music] and that's what's required to get this thing into my office uh it's the last question ever so I guess the last it my overexposed it's just so harsh Oh perfect perfect perfect dude the big question Arizona asked is how much of these things and they are right around two grand they have a couple of different versions to get but they start below two grand they go over two grand that's that's expensive it's a lot of money for an electric bike but if you start to compare them to other high quality electric bikes it's kind of in the sweet spot there are certainly bikes that are more expensive and they're definitely having low quality bikes that are less expensive and that's kind of it on the super 73 one thing that I will say is this company seems you're doing a lot of work with YouTube creators I love that Sam here has done a video Sam here send it wide Sam here has done a video it's super 73 she was subscribed to Sam by the way you helped me make this video Jesse who else is done Jesse's worked with super 73 you work with so they just gave me this bike super 73 if you want to work with me more formally I'd love to do something love your product but it seems like a great company it's an American start-up these things are designed in California and I gotta say for for if you're in the market for an electric bike is non-traditional as this is because most of like they look like regular bikes this is like a your yeah this thing's pretty amazing and I have to say Summer 2018 this is probably gonna be my main ride right I'm with it it's so much better ride alright that's it for our 360 I'll see you tomorrow I rode my bicycle past your window last night I roller skated to your door at daylight [Music]",

places but what happened in New York City this morning Mary and Chris we all just got alerts on our phone telling everyone in the area of 58th and 8th to shelter in place immediately take a look behind me you can see 58 is actually blocked off at ninth Avenue NYPD officers SWAT teams state police all here on scene working to contain the situation there was a bomb discovered this morning at the CN n offices which is in the Time Warner building in midtown here in New York City important detail no one was injured the NYPD great job bomb squad great job happy to hear that a lot of my former colleagues and and friends are at CNN so you can hear me was also and to turn on the TV all the news channels they're running this story just over and over and then if you look at news online like this is the New York Times on Fox talks about a bomb CNN even on BBC which is a more of a global news source top item there is about an explosive and an explosive being sent to New York City and pretty usual they talked about the resilience of New Yorkers that it's still business as usual here in the city of New York so I want to make a little video that's what this is showing you you know people at home people watch this YouTube channel from all around the country and all around the world to show you what it's like actually to be here in New York City as a denizen of the city as someone who lives here you look at it on TV it feels like that the whole city's standing still and everything's stopped because of this like really terrible incident but what's it actually like here I want to make very clear that the people in New York City will not be intimidated that we are going to go about our lives undeterred because the very concept of terrorism is to change us and we will not allow that to happen this is Manhattan now my studio my office is down here in downtown Manhattan the incident took place in midtown here right at 59th Street do you know what happened this morning at the CN n building in Midtown no I think I just got like a notification on my like service alert thing was that there was like a thing that the bomb squad picked up yes yeah I just found out about have you noticed anything like different in the city because of that incident no okay well like we just found out on the train and everyone like got the little notifications on but it was kind of like whatever because we get that all the time for like Amber Alerts I haven't noticed anything have you know [Music] you cannot be terrorized if you refuse to allow the terrorists to win people the city have shown time and again that they stand up in the face of these efforts to intimidate do you know where happened this morning I like I live around there and I got at work amberle er which scared me why I'm not sure there was like type that happened yeah I'm trying to make a movie like what's it like to be in the city on something like that happen Stano is anything any changes would people the city at large when something like that takes place well being new newly moved here and when I found that out in the workplace I saw a shift and everyone's demeanor I think it put everyone in a really sick to their belly feeling and it scared me especially as someone that's new to the this is 53rd and 7th this is about six block seven blocks from where the incident took place this morning I wouldn't know who looking around that anything that today's different from any other day here in here in midtown Manhattan open a block closer so I'm gonna get a little closer and see what I can see there is an increased police presence here but I'm like a block away from the Time Warner building oh yeah have you noticed anything different in the city today because of what happened this morning um well there's a lot of police and like a lot of like you know what happened no there was an explosive device found and that's my mobility oh my god with a block there it's really important at a moment like this to remember the vast majority of Americans the vast majority of New Yorkers are good people trying to live in peace with each other [Music] what I heard they say something like some bomb triggers like my dad when something like this happens do you notice any difference in the way the city operates people is gonna be this typical New York response would just be I'm late for work my boss doesn't care we have to get to work or we have to get where to happen this morning and even this close to it I talked to a lot of people walking by and there's two schools of thought I know what happened and I don't care I've got to live my life and I don't know what happened and I don't care I have to live my life it's the reality it's the world that we live in so people just gonna keep going on people gonna be vigilant but you know we're gonna be vigilant but everyone's gonna keep going you know doesn't stop in the office [Music] on the news and it feels like a huge global event it is and this isn't to undercut the significance of what happened but to really underscore the resilience of people in New York City the city just keeps going no matter what happens are the reason why I love it here so much what they are trying to do is scare us and destabilize us and we will not allow that to happen we are New Yorkers we are smart we are tough we are resilient and we will not allow these terrorist bugs to change the way we live our lives",

South Africa my wife is South African so we usually go to Cape Town to see your family at least once a year where are you going surfing Muizenberg God so you must have seen like on my profile or something I must have been had a surfing photo or something and that's where the whole shark thing began good to see you if it seemed a bit great white sharks Thanks no joke there's a big like shark sign that day when we went out and there's a black flag I didn't know him and he's like watch out for the Sharks watch out for the Sharks it looks like there'd be sharks lurking around no I don't know what does that mean we went surfing in South Africa it was a good time but I was invited there to speak at this like really fancy it's a big deal right that's a big it's out like biggest creative I was I was there to speak of this big create event and they gave me this super fancy super posh hotel room I like Dan and I was like dude I had this sweet hotel room if you want to bring your girlfriend there to stay the night is like a thing you know I'm not using it and he was like sure and I was like here's the card just whatever you do don't make a fuss at the door I I got it so I got into a massive fight with my girlfriend at the time then long story short I ended up running away from her dad in her house and I jumped over the fence and I broke my foot and then I phoned you and I was like dude do you think I can still go to the photo room so to try and apologize to her I put on a tuxedo with no shoe cuz I had my broken foot and I was like dragging it through the bottom of the hotel and I was like I'm coming in and they were like no you not and I was like no but I know Casey Neistat and then eventually I got into the room but it caused a massive big problem and I actually never ended up getting back together with that it goes yeah so that's that hope that was like the first time we met it was it was entirely a scene movie hangover yeah yeah this feels like my life you

how's the investigation some fake Mercedes shooting some fake dude I guess it looks hard hi dude I can't walk past this line because I have like official gear oh no this is what you call a picture car that's not a real compliment but to have a picture car like this in New York City nians there has to be actual cops nearby just in case someone gets confused I think the real cops are over there I can't tell though they don't look real hot pretzels drop hot dog buns a million reasons to love New York City but like skateboarding into work and going buy a movie set like that just makes it I don't know just remind you how amazing this city is this is my new necklace this is my new amulet highly fashionable yesterday I was out of town on a shoot on a big shoot that was awesome somebody came up to me on this shoot and they said part of the reason why I moved to New York City was because I was watching your vlogs they're watching my vlogs and all of the time lapses and all of the footage of New York City is what convinced them to move here that exact conversation I have at least once a week if not more so it's been a little while since I've uploaded and rather than explain why I haven't uploaded I thought I would share with you kind of what I've been thinking I wrestle like on a daily basis I wrestle with like existential thoughts like what is the point why am i doing everything that I'm currently doing and TV little context of that it's like I've got a grown kid I got a little kid not to have another kid is YouTube channel this office my company got my running which is just crazy why do I run so much my loving wife why do I wake up every single day before 5:00 a.m. what am i chasing and the answer is I don't know and this isn't like some emotional cry for help I am extremely happy I'm happy right now I'm a happy person I'm I'm grateful for everything that I have I'm appreciative of what I am and and how I got here there's very little that I take for granted but I want more I want to do more I want and I want and I want in Y like where does that come from a B C they always BBC closing always be closing always be closing one of my one of my favorite creators one of my favorite people Ethan Klein he's like taking some time off right now and he posted that he's taking a little break because he felt like he was chasing something instead of appreciating what he had I really like that I think it's poetic and that's beautiful see yeah ambition ambition is both a curse and a blessing it's a blessing because without ambition you're just kind of treading water it's ambition that makes you swim to places you could never imagine it's ambition that takes you everywhere you would ever want to go but it's a curse ambition is a curse because it's not getting to that destination it's not achieving what you hope to achieve that satiates are satisfies your ambition it's the actual chasing it's the do ambition is only like the imaan sterlet ambition is only fed if you're constantly spoon feeding it the doing not the accomplishing so every time that someone who's really ambitious tries to stop you've stopped feeling satisfied the curse that is ambition always demands more and I don't think that everyone is cursed or blessed with ambition I don't think that like ambition is this universal North Star so that brings me back to KC the existentialist what's the point what is the universal North Star what's the one thing we're all chasing after and I think like in my heart I genuinely think that one thing that we are all pursuing in life is happiness happiness is the point happiness is the ultimate accomplishment it's what we all want or it's at least what we all should want happiness and and happiness doesn't just manifest as a product of ambition but it can come from love or it can come from calmness or it can come from whatever is a sense of fulfillment what in life gives you that and then thinking that through like what makes me happy I you know my family makes me happy my running makes me happy wait yep before 5:00 in the morning makes me happy and feeding my unrelenting ambition with work makes me happy so here I am back in the office doing one thing that makes me happy my North Star which is my work which is making video and that that kind of brings me to the next thing that I want to share with you so this morning for the first time in the history of ever we took all the white frosting off of the windows of the 368 retail store and now you can see it [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] now technically

in 1989 with Tim Burton's Batman now I was a child when this movie came out but I remember seeing in the theaters and it blew my mind you can't make an omelet without breaking some eggs I've seen it like 20 times since and it still holds ever dance with the devil in the pan Tim Burton's Batman is definitely one of the best superhero movies ever was it better than 2008 Dark Knight that's a tough one Christopher Nolan levelled up the entire superhero genre with the Dark Knight that bank robbery scene was one of the best bank robbery seems probably since michael mann's he also like Jon Favreau's iron man that's iron man won [Music] the combination of Favreau and Robert Downey jr. was was pretty brilliant it was the first time we saw any humor in the superhero genre please no gang size but when it comes to humor in the superhero genre it's Deadpool that takes the cake the way that like he even broke down the fourth wall in this movie was genius fourth wall break inside a fourth-wall break that's like 16 walls the casting the characters the factory like it was self-aware and it kind of picked on the x-men and they joked about not having enough budget it's funny that I only ever see two of you it's almost like the studio couldn't afford another x-man the taxi driver yes Ghita the movie is absolutely genius I can't wait to see number 2 now recently I also watched Wonder Woman and I didn't see in the theaters I watched at home with my three-year-old daughter who also loved it it was just an awesome movie the tie-ins with World War 2 in the historical stuff Sam Raimi's spider-man was good the first one but the other ones I mean I could take him or leave him guardians of the galaxy was also awesome I mean I loved the nostalgic soundtrack and like all the 1980s references it was a great story as far as superhero movies go they really they delivered alright that's it for my superhero masks by the way all those superhero masks for that quick scene they cost hundred and eighty six dollars I'm gonna try and return them but the expectations for Black Panther tonight they're on a different level and they're on a different level because of one reason and that is Ryan Coogler Ryan Coogler is the director of Black Panther now Ryan's only made two other movies the first movie was a movie called Fruitvale station it was so good that it honestly made me not want to make feature films I know that I'm not capable of telling a story the way that he told that story that was his first movie his second movie was Creed the rocky movie the Philadelphia movie the Creed is kind of the only movie that I've seen that I can remember literally in the theaters Candis and I standing up and applauding at the screen so I have to I have to leave in four minutes to go meet Aquila but expectations extremely high for tonight's screening [Music] Candis is Lake Superior movies so I'm bringing my friend akela as my date look at this picture she just posted on Twitter she um she painted her fingernails to look like black panther she painted tiny black panthers on her fingernails and that that's how I know I I picked the right day Kim yeah a lot of people showing up for this preview screening yeah preview tonight preview are you excited for it all right [Music] Akilah seems pretty confident that we just cut the whole line I was outside waiting she wasn't God this all I need thank you expectations best movie since the Dark Knight that's what you think it's gonna fit in I think it's gonna be like that like like Atari Dark Knight was the last like seminal supergirls yes and I did like we're gonna be quoting and we're gonna be referencing it for a decade every day at what point in time I can he yelled at for bringing a huge camera and microphone into a

the storms getting closer see this great band ear behind that is rain I mean I'm no meteorologist but that's just my prediction [Music] [Music] okay much much to discuss today on the show I want to start things off with a really awesome update something that I've been looking forward to sharing with you for a while now which is that a few weeks ago when I crossed the 10 million threshold I launched this t-shirt and it was part of like an initiative to raise money for this young lady who lives in Flint Michigan her name is Mari she was trying to raise money to give the school supplies and backpacks to kids who otherwise couldn't afford it I announced that for every shirt sold we give four dollars to her fundraiser and we did it we sold twenty-five hundred thousand thousand dollars to her fundraiser which I'm going to give right now ha we did it guys good work everyone we did it we push Mari over her goal of $75,000 Mari I hope to meet you someday and I should say that I've never met Mari Mari I hope to meet you someday her people and and she personally reach out to me on Twitter and we've been dealing a little bit so amazing getting to know you alright what else in the update there's nothing on here it's just a blank pieces ah Twitter we got the handle on Twitter don't ask how we got that but we got the hand I'll follow 368 on Twitter we'll try to be interesting we have the same handle on Instagram I think we got the same handle on Instagram so now both the Instagram and Twitter handle 4 3 6 8 is simply at 3 6 8 that is called nepotism okay ah other update beam that you haven't heard me talk about beam in a long time the team from being that I used to make videos with they're still making videos they still operate independently they're still doing their own thing and the stuff that they're making is fantastic so I'll link their channel below they're on YouTube send them some love you won't regret it [Music] my friend Griffin Harrington shot that this morning on the subway Griffin nice catch but that is that is really how wet it is in New York City today a couple days ago on Twitter I saw this video that was kind of going viral and it was this kind of like big mafioso looking dude sitting on like a public transportation train and he was just shaving matter-of-factly he had shaving cream on he was shaving and the people film me or sort of snickering and making a joke of it and it was it was and I remember my finger went straight the retweet button and I hovered over it I thought it'd be funny to share it's a very New York City moment but I didn't click the button and I thought for a second look maybe there's more to this story i whatever and then I scrolled on and I went on with my life so then this morning I see this news story that's trending and the title of the of the news story is man can't save II on train and viral video says don't judge so let me just I'm just gonna read a little bit a man was mocked online after he was recorded shaving at his seat on a commuter train heading out of New York City said he was just trying to clean up after days spent in a homeless shelter the story goes on it says the truth Torres says is that the video captured him at a vulnerable moment he had been homeless staying at a shelter in New York City he reached out to his family for help a brother gave him money for a train ticket and then this is the part that really hit me hard he goes he left a shelter before having a chance to shower and clean up and he wanted to look presentable so the nut of the story is just that this guy has a really hard life he's trying to get some help he didn't want to look like a schlub so he shaved and he was ridiculed for it and the story ends by saying a quote from his brother maybe people will have more feeling knowing what this kid's been through so the moral of the story for me is never judge generally like everybody has their own demons that they're dealing with their own struggles that they're dealing with so before before I judge I I want to make a more concerted effort to really try to empathize with others and that's what that that's that story just kind of made me think of how's it going how many captains today five five yeah I'm Casey yeah Justin is this the most popular one so far it is Justin let me see okay and of all of Jeremy's great designs what about that one you like the most I think it's more most actionable probably it's a good reminder I think to keep it in top of mine all the times Jeremy I was gonna give the your tattoo operation a plug anything I should say are all the slots gone I found a link below the Jeremy 368 tattoo project is up and running new designs every day and a couple of slots there's some left this week okay all right later eight skateboarding in the rain search after Dan got hurt standing in the rain at me Oh Dan I gotta talk to you about Dan dad was only here temporarily you know from the start but we weren't sure when like that temporariness we weren't sure how long the whole thing was gonna last and okay so I guess he was in Northern Ireland for like a video conference or something and instead of coming back to New York he had to go back to South Africa and he told me from South Africa he's like hey bro I heard you like the South Africa none of it made any sense there's something you had to deal with there apparently so I danced back in Cape Town not permanently but for now and it's really sad because he's like three 6/8 cheerleader and mascot and he's just drawn don't forget us stand [Music] [Music]",

            "data": "I want to give a tiny a bit of context to this interview I want to explain why did this interview and and how this interview came to be Logan Paul has had an outsized impact on the YouTube community his actions affect the entire community and while this is true of all big creators Logan Paul in in general and the size of his audience have amplified the consequences of his bad decisions there was a sense of shame and embarrassment around a lot of the YouTube community after the suicide forest video and and all the the fallout from the negative press because of the suicide forest video and in the aftermath of that Logan did some interviews and Logan released some videos explaining himself but I know that I was left with a lot of questions questions about his intent and why he did what he did and you know he still has this enormous audience on YouTube what are his plans what are his intentions moving forward so a couple of weeks ago when he contacted me about a documentary he's currently making about his life on YouTube I obviously had a lot of questions but I told him that I would be willing to do the interview for his documentary provided he'd be willing to come here and sit with me so I could interview him on my channel and to his credit to Logan's credit he agreed and he agreed that nothing would be off-limits and he also encouraged me to challenge him he he he wanted it to be an honest and hard interview so those are the circumstances surrounding it that's how it came to be and it's now been a full week since I did the interview and to be totally honest I wasn't sure I'm still not sure if releasing it is the right thing I I Harbor a lot of self-doubt about maybe I was too easy on him I mean maybe I was too argumentative with him the things I hope to learn my very specific intention with this interview was to see if he was sincere about what he's trying to accomplish with this documentary or if the whole thing is just a charade for good PR and now I feel like watching this interview over and over and over I still I don't know I there's a little bit of me that thinks maybe I'm enabling Logan he and I have known each other for years we've always been friendly and by putting this on my channel am I now part of the machine to rehabilitate his image it's not what I want to do that is not my intention but could this be viewed as that I I don't know so I hope that this interview will help the community better understand why he did the really stupid things that he did and if he's now truthful and sincere about wanting to have a positive impact on the platform the platform that he and his really stupid really terrible decisions and actions did so much damage to so I'm I'm really seeing and this video is not monetized this video is also not edited this is the entire 30 minute conversation that I had with Logan Paul one week ago so let me start I just want to ask what is this documentary yeah so I mentioned in one of my vlogs and there's been a lot of speculation on what people think it is the doc is not a it's not a documentary about how dang hard my life has been this year it's about the story of a young man from Ohio a seemingly regular kid being me of course falling into the social medium machine over the past four years building an audience garnering false power through views which equates to money which equates to against success and then essentially losing it all overnight becoming the most hated man in the world in the snap of a finger so the question that the doc answer is how do you recover from that can you recover from that me sitting you with you right now I'm in the journey right now with you like will is it possible for Logan Paul to make a comeback or am I going to be a failed youtuber and fall and crawl into a hole like half the world wants me to do is you know just ask directly is this a fluff piece to make people feel better about Logan Paul no no not at all this it's it's from making content throughout the years I try to be as unbiased as possible and when you say fluff piece like what because like a video it's just like look ride that you should feel bad here's a way to characterize it is the video about how you've learned to better empathize with others or is the video about making it easier for people to sympathize with you um I don't I don't think people should can or will sympathize with me let's be honest Casey like what I did it there's no distracting people there's no well here's what I tried to do and this is why it's okay there's none of that it's an unbiased objective story that captures how something like that can happen and what what went wrong in my life that I thought that was a good idea because at the end of the day I'm the one who has to look in the mirror and say that was my decision and that's that's a hard thing to do is even like hard talking about it right now with you because up until that point in my life I I it was really only winds it was only success it was only consistent growth and and everything was going so well and I got so caught up with my actions being validated by millions of people I forgot to be a human being in that situation and instead decided to be a content creator and that's where I messed up do you it's are even in there there's a little even in that response there was like maybe I'm being cynical but there's a little whiff of it sounding like you see yourself in some capacity as a victim no I know by no means am I the victim here and I guess it's it's sort of tough because I want to make it very clear I am I am not the victim here by no means and everything I say I do need to not word it like that because I'm I'm not the victim what I'm not afraid to do though is be vulnerable about this and open up and say by no means by no means I know what I did was disgusting it was it was wrong it was an extreme obviously lapse in judgment like I've said but by no means am I am I the victim or claiming to be the victim do you would you characterize this is a redemption story it's an attempted redemption story is what it is that's it are we still talking about the doc yeah I mean that's what it is that's what like again will I come back I say yes that's what this what the doc is about the story is is it not how long has it been since the yeah is it not is it not premature like it before you can tell a redemption story there has to be an act of redemption true so what is that what is that what is the act of redemption bin for Logan Paul it's it's not been done yet that's what the doc is about and like again this whole the whole idea of the harlot is crazy fine the whole the whole idea of the doc is like we don't have plans for it we don't plan on like profiting off it if if we if we are gonna monetize it if I don't know I don't know cuz what we want to do I've told stories my whole life through a lens as have you so the thought process is why why'd let someone else make that story cuz someone's gonna want to make that story people have wanted to make that sort why let someone else do it when I could just do it myself and I know that if we do decide to monetize it 100% of the proceeds will go to some sort of suicide prevention awareness program because that's that's essentially what this whole thing is about are you are you a different person now than you were yeah absolutely oh let me follow it up by because I've heard you say that how have you demonstrated that how have you not just said but what have you done to demonstrate that and are you even sharper in saying that like a lot of your content I think the suicide video that you came out with your first video back no really demonstrated what your channel is capable of and talking about something bigger than just Logan Paul but there hasn't been much since then there hasn't been much that's demonstrated you're a different person you talk about positivity and being a different person and changing the structure of the channel and then it was days later you're shooting a dead mouse so what what had you done to demonstrate you changed as a person the rat the rat was right yeah the rat was that was me becoming obsessed with the idea of being a villain when when the whole world hates you I just I made the conscious decision I'm gonna I'm gonna be the guy they think I am and I essentially became the architect of my own destruction because I wanted to be who they thought I thought I might as well adopt this adopt this screw it and it wasn't that a direct contradiction to everything you just put out about how you're changing and how you're a different person yeah videos we're inside of a week yeah I know but it to me while I can still be a good person I'm also still was possibly am the guy who takes things to extremes that's I mean that's that's who I am that's the brand of Logan Paul it's the fastest the biggest the best the greatest and but and it's not that led you to the I mean that's how you started this exactly I mean that's that's everything is to the extreme right so if I can make content and I have been for four years for four years making people laugh smile believing themselves making them believe that they can accomplish their goals even if they're from a small town in Ohio because I made these mistakes yes I'm going to demonstrate more empathy and more compassion but at the same time I still have my brand and what saw thing to me is that brand of living life on the edge do you understand I I do but I think it's sort of a convenient umbrella to hold over everything so I think it it's Noble when you talk about motivating people I think it's it's I think it's a noble ambition to want to inspire and motivate people especially someone like how you characterize yourself and coming from being a normal guy yeah but I think that like to use that same to use that same pretext as sort of justification for you know killing a rat or well I didn't kill the rat those circumstances around that video or some of the other more controversial sensational things you've done running around Japan wearing silly outfits yeah so that Union sensitive to culture that's all part of the same I want to address this cuz I'm not gonna lie this is the the hardest thing about all this is I think being perceived as culturally insensitive as far as the outfits go they were on sale at a store right next to the temple that we were at for tourists do we not buy the outfits don't know if they're on sale there and then deeper I mean that's we could dive into the specifics of what happened there's a difference between culturally insensitive and insensitive the brand that I was at the time was just all-around insensitive and that's the person who I am no longer trying to become and will no longer represent on the vlogs yeah and you think that that has been the case with your content since that moment till now there's this looking ahead this okay so it's it's this is looking ahead yes but because you're right it's like I said those things and then you go and taser that rat what the what happen did you just contradict everything and the answer is again like you said yes that's why it's hard for me because how many times can you say one thing and then try to be a better person but truly now it's like I'm vegan now I got a girlfriend who is extremely wise and she helps me grow and become the person I want to become my content is focused more on positivity and doing what you want to do to achieve your goals which is all like I said it's always been that but all that stuff is overlooked when you make mistake or why sensationalism clouds that it's like a an eclipse if if that mission which again I do think is noble but wanting to motivate I don't I don't even want to say it but when a moon comes in front of it and that moon is a moon of sensationalism that is harmful it clouds out a completely black Wow what's what's harmful I mean I think like the general sort of disrespectfulness that comes along with that kind of some true I think that certainly everything that sort of precipitated the suicide forest incident or I think that the you know like the the tasing of the rat and myriad other just kind of the general attitude that you characterize is living on the edge I think really clouds a lot of that much more a much more meaningful in addition of wanting to inspire true but I think this is a good dovetail for a bigger question that's that's that you and I both identify with which isn't like the pressure of being a youtuber of being a daily vlogger of uploading every single day of having to maintain that audience get more views so you can get paid to keep it going the focus on relevancy that focus on the biggest Channel today the most subscribers say like there are pressures that come along with that where you get this tunnel it's tunnel vision yet and that's why you know in 2016 I stopped logging I remember you you text me the day I stopped vlog because I felt like I went to a place where I was so caught up in that that I was full of well I was gonna ask you one question I have use have you ever found yourself in a place where you are being influenced by your success rather than your creativity and did that lead to your demise because that's what happened to me I would probably push back at the idea that had a demise but certainly it contributed to my not one I did two daily vlog I stopped an Aston stuff like why am I doing this and I was caught up in that tidal wave and that sounds like I don't wanna do it anymore and it's now my work is much more about creative motivation it's much less about like I don't care about use fighting for Elephants he doesn't make sense I don't care about that but I do want to back up so I ask this question because I want to understand where your head was before you went into that forest I don't want to beat that dead horse you've said a lot about that you've been open about that but I do want to understand like where was your brain leading where was the thought process leading up into that I talking about the day of like you were riding away that I I think no one in the history of YouTube had ever been on that they haven't that's why when I wanted to take you there when I sit here and say that every day we were creating a new piece of content meant to bend the limit push it right up to the edge be entertaining be funny be positive spread a message we got so caught up in creating that we did not stop to think about what we were making and whether or not it was right because it you make it you put it out we were on autopilot essentially which is it's it's extremely dangerous when you're broadcasting to an audience of five to seven million people every day and so there was no thinking there was it was create content create content create content not okay hey take a step back slow down breathe so the time I would be a human being that meet this mission of wanting to inspire and motivate like do you believe that or is that because if that's if that mission is the same as this this momentum this autopilot where's the distinction between wanting to do good and wanting to you know looking for sensationalism that will drive clicks I'm not I'm not sure I understand the question I also do want to say I'm not well-liked while the underlying mission is always that you can you should you achieve it's okay to be different it's I'm not that's not what my channel is entirely about it's a combination of that and it is entertainment it's a light-hearted comedy essentially that's what it is I just think those two things in conflict with one another essentially yeah and that's why I'm a brand that's that's who Logan Paul is because I do bridge the gap between being like a motivational speaker kids and standing on a stage in front of 300 people but also like hey I am a kid I'm 23 years old 22 years old at the time and if I want to go jump out of a plane naked I'm gonna do it but at the same time you can work hard and achieve your anybody ever want to do anything anybody ever faulted Logan Paul for jumping out of a plane naked no that's all I'm saying but I could give you a list of like I jumped off a bridge into the river in Italy is that culturally insensitive is saying Mamma Mia in Italy culturally insensitive I don't I would argue that it's just insensible but jumping on the hood of a car in Japan is and culturally it is yeah jumping on the hood of a car in Japan is culturally insensitive dressed as a pokemons throwing a Pikachu at the car I I absolutely think why do you think that's insensitive well I mean culturally culturally insensitive I think that's insensitive but the fact that it's being pinpointed to be culturally insensitive when I do that did did that everywhere that's hard for me that's hard for me to hear and listen to I mean without getting into too much nuance you're the culture of Pokemon is very much woven into the culture of Japanese culture yeah you were dressed up as a character from a Japanese pop cult you were dressed as a Japanese pop culture sort of icon as Pikachu so like I do think that there is a connection there well but Kasey they sell the outfits in Japan I understand I understand that do you Casey cuz I saw I don't know I don't agree with you but I I don't agree with me I want to make that clear I don't I don't agree with me or think what I did was right I'm just saying there's a difference between being culturally insensitive insensitive towards a culture and overall insensitivity which is what the old Logan Paul had an issue with and had a problem with and is now today what I'm working to not do ever again I just think you were both of those things okay okay but let me ask you took a month off yeah and talking about that autopilot that mentum and I get that dude I was been have been there how did that month off help you empathize and understand both the criticism coming at you which was like insane never seen anything like it yeah and then how did that like what did you learn in that month off so during the month off it was a lot of meeting talking to visiting Ashley came to New York for a couple days suicide prevention organizations organizations about mental health and finding out what it what it truly is like to have suffered from depression or know someone with depression or even know someone that has died by suicide because that ain't it's just it's just bad cuz this that's crazy Rose New York sorry the sirens here at the office are just unbearable um this is what I had that mother up there okay are you so you can see when they're passing dude I mean I have hours of footage of me just cursing the world um but continue you tell you you did you invested time in meeting with people yeah and to this day to this day the guy who is uh in my suicide be here tomorrow video at Kevin Hines I text him every single day and we we want to do something together in the in the future obviously I'm focused on this fight right now that's my number one mission but the month off was a step for me to once again become a human being and forget about views money success and clout and it was a chance for Logan Paul to be like okay this this this is why this is wrong because I had never been like I said in the video affected my suicide I don't know I didn't I didn't know what it what it means to know some are loose someone who has died by suicide so it was an attempt for me to discover that and once again like I said a million times right now become an actual human being and after after that video dropped I guess it's like did did did he give you an appreciation for the cuz that video I think had a very important message behind it was a I like that video I tweeted that I liked that video and I'm gonna get for it but did it show you sort of the demonstrate to you that your channel is capable of so much more and your reach is capable and your voice is capable of so much more than just sensationalism views yes but I mean but I I don't want to say I didn't know that I just was doing the wrong thing with with that capability I was I wasn't putting out PSAs like that it's it's the most viewed suus anti-suicide PSA ever and it was groundbreaking for me to realize it's it is possible for me to create a piece of content that can change that many lives I will say what we did in that video was the attempt with the forest video beginning middle and end I made it very clear that it is okay to feel ostracized and alone what's not okay is holding those feelings in and that I truly believe quote-unquote that every person has a place on this on this earth but we did that in such the wrong way we tried to shock it into people versus showing and demonstrating it's my telling and hard to believe that that's what the suicide forest video was about when you guys are laughing and smiling and just the thing that bothered me the most about the video was your excitement exercise you were excited to have found a dead body not not really this is oh this is this is what I watched it that was the emotion that I was that I that I took you from you and your Posse you guys felt like we've got something here that's going to get us views at the beginning of the video is like something you've never seen on YouTube before that is what affected me the most about that video because I understand that mission and I do think your your suicide video really accomplished that but if you're gonna conflate the two then I just have to I have to tell you why I don't I don't I don't agree with that complaint okay okay let's let's I want to hear about I want to talk about the fight what what is the fight you're fighting ksi sorry dude it's just it is brothers fight you don't want to move on you dream or you want to know just because yeah the laughing is it's a defense mechanism for me that's what it is absurd you say that do you believe it um I believe it when you're saying it but I don't believe that you expect people the eight million people that saw it video for say you know to understand within those contexts that you were just laughing at as a defense mechanism like I think that there's there's intent and and then there's there's actuality and there's a saying it's like the the road to hell is paved in intent because if all that really matters is what transpired and what transpired is you and your your peers your friends laughing and snickering and and making light of a human being who had died and I think that your intent in that moment is irrelevant all I see is what's actually transpiring I tried to move on from this and talking about the Box English man I just like I know I just understand it's it's hard for me to listen to someone to my face tell me that I was laughing at the guy I'm telling you how I hired a nurse in my perspective I understand I just I've met unique no you're not you're not unique you you do represent the voice of the people which is what I'm learning to I guess be vulnerable about I just like it was never my intent to come off like I was laughing or joking about Seuss I said suicide it's not a joke three times in the video because it's it's clearly not it I never thought it was I just used comedy when I'm uncomfortable or I don't know what to do when there's a lens on me and my actions are essentially being validated by five to seven million people and no one around around me is telling me hey that's not okay I understand that I understand I just excuses never validate yeah truth truth and your answers may be valid but it doesn't excuse the action does not at all and I'm like I said ashamed deplorable mistake and the only thing that I want to do right now is show that that video was not a representation of Who I am who I will become and who I want to be I appreciate that we talked about the plate now yeah sure we can talk about these well because he's turned off after 30 minutes keeping an eye on them what is what is your fighting que si what is the true what is the fight i'ma beat his ass I'm a big boxer I've been boxing for like 12 years I don't like to step into the ring because I don't want to get hit I value my brain too much but just if all I had to rely on was his face love and I wouldn't go very far I need the brain okay okay what is this um why is this happen that's essentially ksi he called me out he called my brother out and I accepted the fight I'm always up for a challenge I thought honestly for me having that event happen in January this was a way to step back from the world of YouTube and stop worrying about the views the money the clout all that went down I haven't grown on Instagram in six months literally at all and focus my efforts on something else so I can become a different guy this is like the boxing win for me is showing people that even if you fail even if you get knocked to the ground even if if you feel like you're at the lowest point of your life you can get up and do something and still win do you think that the fight is part of the redemption story do you see the finest part yeah yeah absolutely absolutely because it's it's not about a fight it's not about the boxing match itself like I said it's about being able to get hit in the face whether they're a result of your own actions or not in my case they are I'm the one who up but I'm willing to say ok this is the mistake I made I'm gonna keep my chin up I'm gonna keep moving forward no matter how many people want me to crawl in a hole and die forever I'm not gonna do that you can fail and still come back and still keep on going and still win so you're Jake's Deji ksi they've been cranking out content every day yeah it's like trash-talking I've seen them at the press conference is just being vicious they've just been non-stop and with exceptions it feels like you've been a little bit more reserved yeah including like the press conference in in London where after ksi just really got gnarly with his you know with his with his verbal exchange like he went to a really crazy place you just got up and walked out is this is this you being like frustrated or is this part of the new Logan Paul it's the new Logan Paul it's I have no interest in bantering back and forth with someone who is the exact person that I'm trying not to become and stay away from by degrading woman by going after my family in a in in a manner that is intended to harm he's I don't I don't have any interest in that the goal for me here is to beat him on August 25th not talk about how I'm gonna beat him not talk about his family or talk about what I'm gonna do to his girlfriend the goal is to win a fight and I just I was over it like I as soon as I walked in the press conference I was like okay this I'm just over the top Casey to be honest it's all it's all Fugazi Fugazi this time to fight this fight words right there um all right and then I I guess like a big question I have for you is like I don't know how to say it up there's a lot of like a lot of YouTube community was upset after a lot of you know the negativity around Logan Paul because they thought you sort of besmirched what it meant to be a youtuber Yeah right rightfully so I guess it's like what do you say to that how do you respond to that huh is there a response for that um I mean to my fellow creators like wholeheartedly I mean I apologized already but I am sorry that I I guess brought shame upon the platform is if that's how I want to word it that's why I say I guess is why I have to be so careful we're like how I talk but that's that's obviously not the person who I want to become or live in the body Oh for the rest of my life and just like I made a mistake I promise I will do the community well and keep my head up and keep on trucking in ring light to YouTube but obviously Casey it's it's horrible to see your peers sure and rightfully so because of my own actions like I just felt bad again I apologize for it I'll apologize for it a thousand times I don't want to sit here and be a sob story for the rest of my life so so then and and this will I want to end it with this but I want to ask what's next for Logan Paul but I want to ask within the context of like understanding your resume now has some some some dirty marks on it understand that you you carry this bag it's and there's no getting rid of it where do you go from here in the world of me what's your where does where do you want to be in ten years and how are you accomplish that having to lug around these you know these chains forever I think Hollywood I think America in general is it's they love Redemption stories they it's it's a story for me my life is now a story about someone who was winning someone who self imploded and was like I said the architect of their own destruction and struggle and vulnerability and now it's being able to say this is a part of my life and I want to become better I don't want to let my mistakes to find me I think a person is defined by how they recover from their mistakes and what's next for me is honestly probably just content creation businesses I can answer this question with a hundred things but all that matters to me right now is to fight August 25th get your tickets Lincoln bye all right thank you thank you for doing this entire interview without plugging your merge once have a shove BM I do I do appreciate your frankness and I appreciate Logan didn't see any of my questions beforehand I didn't bring any of this up so I I thanks for doing a straight interview yeah of course thanks Casey thank you",

Walter Raleigh South survey that was 2008 in Zanzibar vans of ours a little island off the coast of Tanzania Tanzania okay we're jumping on a little plane to go to sandbar now reach there this special edition blog is the story of when Graham and Casey and Clint and van went to Africa and climbed Mount Kilimanjaro so we're going to Tanzania to climb the tallest freestanding mountain in the world big Kilimanjaro how about need a blog about this no right now what you've mentioned it in different vlogs so I never made this vlog you've never made an exclusive Chile law but the doctors I'm getting here that's what I look like without a shirt on ten years ago yellow fever hepatitis typhoid and polio vaccination so that doctor you had to get shot to go to Tanzania for like malaria and malaria yellow fever yeah pitarrio DMV lady polio tetanus typhoid so that was the dream team it was banned KC Clint Graham this is definitely Graham sleeping on the airplane we didn't let we have us we didn't have a plan for anything our first day here we decided to start the climb immediately that we sure if we went there with enough cash that we would find somebody to take us up the mountain which was the case later this month naturally we load the cheapest least expensive guide we could find positive to get up challenger [Music] they were great nice guys I think we realized on our way there that what the value package got you yeah very cheap meat cooker get the meat then we're going to eat on our hikes the top of the mountain here it is now that's our cut so this guy turtle is one of the guys that was the best on the team and he was the official whiskey impresario you guys like whiskey that's except it was weird cuz we stopped at the grocery store to get food for the climb and all that the African guides were suggestions that we buy lots of alcohol for them [Applause] guys idea to bring whiskey up to the summit have to drink we're about to start our mission up to the top of Kilimanjaro one day it was amazing of this climate you literally started in a rainforest and on the last day we were like standing on snow and ice that is Mount Kilimanjaro my thumb is blocking the Sun we have all these dudes carrying all of our stuff it wasn't our choice shooting the porters Porter's are carrying up all the gear but just the sheer amount of they're carrying the law in Tanzania mandates that for every climber you have at least one person carrying your gear and it's a way to like bolster local economies but also they do it for safety we could carry around we tried to they wouldn't let us is that setting up camp on our first night not actually us setting it up other people setting up before us when we're booking the guides we were told we would have high quality chef traveling with us this is their tent where they cooked the food what was his name turtle turtle is the chef turtle was the chef food Oh crew Graham celebrated his 25th birthday on Mount Kilimanjaro happy birthday great birthday and dinner I don't know why I thought it was a good idea to climb out so many darling sneakers supposed to wear hiking boots when you're climbing the highest freestanding mount in the world but you chose sneakers my hiking sneakers are frozen solid this is going to be a problem two days then you can really start to notice me fading I look like a really ugly woman and this is our campsite on the second day we thought it'd be a good idea that instead of spending six days climbing we'd spend three days climbing twice as fast then we used the rest of our time in Africa to travel it was a great idea until the morning of the summit climb the craziest part of being up here is that were above the clouds I just want to point one thing out also the Red Hat that Casey's wearing so Megan the summit push tomorrow so not only did he not bring hiking boot but he also didn't bring a hat that was a hat that I've had three school camps this is campus third day freezing out here you're about to witness the moment when this entire trip for me went for me a fun totally a fun adventure to just an absolute his last day and climbing to the summit in the morning it's about 20 below freezing feeling strong hey you feeling grabbed strong next shot will be from the peak so in the end we made it we we summited [Music] [Applause] [Music] after some and so we did fly straight from the mountain to Zanzibar this tropical island off the coast of Tanzania and that was like today's our last day in Zanzibar and then we are coming home to New York and data that is the story of when Graham and I with van and Clint climb Mount Kilimanjaro [Applause] [Music] just as an aside there's an unpaid endorsement but this is grams and company grams and entrepreneur it's why we're such good friends we share a lot of similarities what is this gram man can is awesome why 100 percent California wine hey Grande this isn't one of your poems over so I just wanted to show the audience that you're also a badass entrepreneur okay that's it see you tomorrow",

            "data": "just a quick preface here this interview took place twelve days ago now so any reference in this interview to Logan Paul or Logan Paul controversy is in reference to the events that transpired around the first of the year the Japanese forests not at all referencing the more recent Logan Paul controversy and and subsequent D monetization of his channel none of that is reference because that all happened after this interview took place while I would love to know more specifically what's around YouTube with these recent events unfortunately this interview took place before they happened hope that's clear okay here's the interview alright welcome ah have you ever made a YouTube video before no it's my first one I'm always very vocal with what I see as YouTube YouTube strengths and YouTube shortcomings and as Chris around Christmas and New Year's when all the logan paul stuff was going down and there was a lot of criticism of youtube's PR and everything else i e-mailed robert here and said why not use the platform as a way to communicate youtube's positions on these things in its outlook for the future and he said that's a great idea and this is sort of a first stab at that he offered thank you to come on my youtube channel and talk about the future of youtube and answer whatever questions I had is that fair that is absolutely fair and I'm so happy to be here so thanks for it's actually your idea it wasn't my idea it was yours and and it's risky but today that's that's what do you guys do risky stuff every day tell us who you are I think most youtubers and they think of YouTube leadership's they know Susan but people don't know you so who are you and what do you do sure so I'm Robert Kinsel I'm chief business officer of YouTube and in my day to day job I'm responsible for all the YouTube creators and and and content partners who are making their living on YouTube and creating amazing audiences so all of your problems are my problems your wins or my wins so we are tied at the hips and and I just love what I do I think most people collect most people's questions have to do with the Logan Paul controversies it's still very very fresh and to leave that off I'm curious what's it like for you and then what's it like inside of YouTube when something like that or any of the previous controversies happen is there a protocol in place yeah I mean we have depending on on severity of the issue at hand we have escalation processes that take place and and we're looking at you know how this how this works against the guidelines the community guidelines that we have set on YouTube which really help operate an open platform like ours there's there's quite a lot of work that goes on behind the scenes that the rest of the world doesn't see how did it how did it land on the home page I think you have there are no simple answers to that except that there was a lot of interest in that video there were a lot of search searches for it all around the world on YouTube and it ended up there I think was nine days between it happening and you guys responding to it how about you better so so we actually we had a we had a press reply the next day within in less than 24 hours but our social response was delayed and so what we were working on is we were trying to formulate our our response and of course you know with Logan and a lot of his projects for original productions there are hundreds of people involved people whose paychecks depend on it so we don't want to make a rash decision that impacts so many people's livelihood it's not just Logan many other people are cross multiple projects however we do want to be much faster we're looking at those processes and and and we want to be much more active there was a line in that statement you guys put out an unsocial that said we'll have more to share soon on the steps we're taking to ensure a video like this is never circulated and I think that line of video like this had a lot of the community questioning what that means and this is a bigger question which is how do you how do you balance kind of being the thought police saying this is okay and this is not versus free speech which is are like YouTube is stood for so much so and and you're you're hitting the nail on the head which this is one of the hardest things scaling open is developing standards making sure that users feel safe creators feel safe and advertisers feel safe obviously this video was not something that you know and I don't think anyone you know anyone is proud of proud to be associated with but we think that the more we develop our Community Guidelines the more we hone them and there will our standards along those lines we think we we can get their culture YouTube culture I've noticed sort of in the last year last year plus drama has been drama would be the descriptor out used to really drive the culture of YouTube what do you think of that I found that are you talking about the drama you create drama is rewarded with use drama is rewarded with attention drama is rewarded ultimately with dollars and I think a lot of that is what what eventually sort of metastasized into the kind of sensationalist content that let things like the Logan Paula controversy happen yeah how do you how does YouTube affect culture it to I'm talking about the incentives and disincentives for that or thinking very deeply and every single day now on how do we create the right incentives and disincentives for creators to to do the right thing on YouTube and that means a lot of different things that means do the right things for advertisers do the right things for their users you know for the platform organically and not chase sensationalism not chase views for the sake of views not use drama for the sake of use and not use drama at our expense for the sake of use it so what's at heart for us is that we deeply care about the Train Riko system that's my job if you don't succeed we don't succeed what we want to make sure that creators who are making a living on YouTube feel safe doing so you know that there's no gaming basically that it's just all about like doing the right thing and it is our job to set those guidelines in place and the incentives in place so so we're working that quite busily what kind of creators would you like to see more of on the platform are you talking about me personally or - the bigger question of culture like whoa what would you love to see ultimately is kind of the defining creator movement on the platform and how would how would you how would you to foster the kind of relationships needed to enable I so I personally like a lot of news content news related content on YouTube it just you know helps catch up on everything's going on and it's just and it has a different Flair on YouTube educational content but I don't mean the traditional educational says it's just that I I've learned something new my older daughter who became vegan and you know we didn't want them to become vegan and and and then you know them you know because it's a lot of work Penda and you know she found all the inspiration and all the arguments and how to argue and convince parents on YouTube by the way the one category I didn't mention is and we would like more and more female creators on the platform right that yeah it's it's a huge opportunity huge and and so Elle Mills have you discovered Ella Mills yet and by the way every time you told me that I remember the last time you said oh you know you gotta watch this this kind david dobrik this was like three years ago it was like he's on the rise and of course yeah so I know you'd have an eye for it so I'll make sure to follow her no but that's that's another category that we really focused on what what do we want to grow in we want everybody to grow but what do we want to grow a little bit more that maybe is underserved that maybe needs the extra push extra push in terms our attention extra push in terms of marketing count them funding whatever it is and then we put somebody on it and say build a plan they build a plan approve the plan and then they start executing against it that's really that's how the process with us works this is a big kind of this is a big question I have that I've always had which is that in all my years in television I never met a TV studio head who wasn't at one time a TV producer and in cinema I've never met a movie studio and who didn't produce movies but no one on the YouTube sort of senior executive leadership side has ever made a living as a creator so how do you how does Susan how do the other leaders at YouTube empathize with the struggles of being a creator having never been there yourself so I might not have produced myself but I just give you my little quick background I started in the mailroom of a talent agency working with writers actors directors States tickling their pictures and resumes and sending it to cast entities that Sarah became an assistant and just went to work for a production movie production financing companies have made a lot of films and and then went to HBO and launched HBO's around the world and eventually to Netflix and then to YouTube so I've been around content all of my professional career and and I've learned it from inside out and every angle so I'm deeply passionate about it I love it and that's my both my professional and personal life now when it comes to when it comes to but I have now been a YouTube creator myself when you think about YouTube it's really a massive platform it's a technology like it's massive technological feat and what you really need is people who are incredibly proficient at building an infrastructure on a you know unprecedented level all around the world of interesting 450 hours of video every single minute is streaming in billion hours a day in HD quality so what our company has to do is sort of marry the technological prowess with content prowess together and and do it at scale the changes in the partner program so you have to have four thousand hours of watch time a thousand subs to monetize a question or something I saw a lot on on Twitter was new or tiny YouTube channels seeing that is tremendously discouraging how do you how do you respond to that so we don't succeed unless you succeed if there are no great creators they're not gonna be enough users there's not enough advertisers it just it doesn't work so we we think that this level is high enough for us to learn about the partner so that we can turn the ads on them and not disappoint advertisers and at the same time that it's not so far out that it will be untenable and you know and unreachable for that we want as many creators monetizing but we also want to make sure that everybody who's monetizing is doing the right thing and and it's protective because if somebody doesn't do the right thing and are in there and that vert eyes is react in a certain way then all of you get punished that's not a good outcome because then you don't succeed we don't succeed because nobody is happy um about monetization when you guys made the changes that were made in response to ad pocalypse there's a lot of frustration a lot of frustration expected expressed on social media did you guys see that outcry coming for the false positives did it catch you off guard it was really really hard because if you're just trying to stabilize the ecosystem that's you know that's that's moving around so yes we heard the outcry of course and and it's the I can tell you there's nothing more painful than hear from the advertisers their stories and nothing more painful is than hear from the creators and and you should know both sides think that we favor the other you know and so we clearly have work to do it does feel like at times that what creators want to make what audiences want to see doesn't always align or doesn't align what advertisers want to want to buy against how do you how do you rectify that some sometimes that happens and and it's really hard to tell an advertiser look you must buy this and because they sell it guess my brand and I just don't want to you know that's their choice one of the one of the things that we worked really hard on last year was our yellow monetization icon because then really which I know might have been you know painful and worked but it was something that helped us reduce false positives by 30 percent it was really impactful you know suddenly getting getting input from creators saying look this was not correct everyone who participated let me ask you about the yellow icon because from a creator from the most cynical creator perspective what it what a few does is a way of saying we think this might not be advertiser friendly so we're gonna cut your revenue on it but we're still playing it so it's costing you the it's costing you the Creator money while we figure this out and I think that I know I as a creator found that very insulting I've known that very upsetting why do I have to take your algorithms mistake why does it have to cost me money how does YouTube address something like that at the kind of scale that I remember you are calling on this issue I think those may be October and were there yeah and and that's when we start to think about the let's let's let's you know what stole creators that they shouldn't you know published them yet have them unlisted I guess with you it's can't and and then you know they won't go through the volatility so that that has worked if you as a creator it feels like there's a lot of tension between the creator community and YouTube as a company is that is that felt do you think it's a fair statement is that felt within YouTube as a company I wouldn't want to call it tension because it would it would imply that we're on opposite sides somehow and we're not I think we're on the same side the thing that we have struggled with and you've told that to me multiple times is communication and you should know that we try so hard to communicate with creators but it's only so disheartening but like we want feedback to keep on coming but it's disheartening to hear that it's not cutting through but you should know that we don't see this tension we see it as if people are not happy we have a problem we're on the same side we need to figure out how to fix it well let me let me end then with this this this and this question this is more of a prompt than a question but I think that YouTube's never been good at saying here's what matters to us here's what we stand for and here's what to expect from us so I invite you to now just kind of use this platform as a way to tell all of us creators in the community what matters to you what do you stand for and what is next for YouTube as as a platform sure so so what we stand for is is really four freedoms freedom of opportunity anybody to make a living on YouTube you know bring revenue from the entire world and there are many wonderful examples freedom of speech as important as ever freedom of information accessing it I grew up in in communist country in Czechoslovakia behind the Iron Curtain it's really important you know the openness and freedom of speech and freedom of information is really important to me and that that is why I I love what I do and then the fourth one is freedom to belong people creating communities on YouTube that they can feel like they can share a bit more with that they may not have in person somewhere else but on the YouTube they do so we have these four core freedoms that we truly care about what what is important to us is the success of our partners the partners our creators and advertisers so to us what's most important is bringing these two communities together advertisers and creators and make sure that they all succeed and if they do we'll be fine and everything that I say is like that you know we're on your side we mean it we may not get it right you know many times or for one reason or another but the intent is always good the intent is always on your side and so hopefully we can deliver more and and truly make everybody even happier and more successful well Robert thank you for coming on and I want to say that Robert did not ask me to do this but I can't have you on Robert without plugging your book stream Punk's by reading this book I got to understand how you think of YouTube and that means a lot considering you're the one pulling all the strings and then the second thing that I like the most and I wish you had talked more about it I think it's just the first chapter of the preface or something is when you talk about your upbringing in here behind the Iron Curtain and not having any access to media at all in the first movie that you ever saw was terminator but it was dubbed and checked nanika I thought oh say Oh same here jonah had an understanding that that's where you're coming from and now that you're in the position you were in enables me to empathize with you and by proxy with youtube and more so Thank You Casey thanks for having me here to do this is Jay all right thanks for watching if you made it that far I just want to put this at the end to again Thank You Tube thank Robert for doing this and then also to encourage YouTube to do more of this there are a lot of other creators in this platform that I know would love to interview some of the senior management at YouTube and there is certainly enough controversy taking place in this platform to warrant those interviews so I know it may not make the most interesting or fun video but I do think this is an effective way for YouTube to share what the hell is going on within that company to us to the community so thanks YouTube okay tomorrow I will be back to my regular programming",

            "data": "so being a youtuber it's the greatest job ever and because of this job and what I do I've gotten to do some of the most incredible things that I could have ever imagined when I was a kid and I think the greatest thing about being a youtuber about being creator having a big audience has been the people that I've gotten to meet and when I think of all the people that I get to meet like what is the most what's the most special in there at the very apex of that pyramid at the very very top has been the individuals I've gotten to meet through the make-a-wish Foundation and make-a-wish is an organization that takes very sick young people and kids and grants them a wish maybe they want to get a Disneyworld or surf in Hawaii or go to a movie set and there's been a couple of kids whose dream it's been is was to meet me and one of those young people was a young man by the name of Errol and maybe you saw the episode I'll link it below but arrow came here to the studio and we hung out and we got to know each other and he's like a fantastic musician and we went to the park and he played the piano and we had lunch with Candice and we drove around on a limousine and like greatest day ever and at the end of like this awesome day I said there was like arrow like why me like why do want to pick me I know you don't want to be a youtuber why me and he was like Casey I've seen how you can bring attention to causes you believe in and I wanted to talk to you about bringing attention to a cause that I believed in and at the end of that it was like the reason why this kid used his one wish to spend time with me is because he thought working with me would be an amazing Avenue to bring attention to others who are in need like a total act of selflessness but all he wanted to do was to help others I got just like blew my mind you know when I was his age I was like smoking pot and chasing girls and here's this young man who's sick trying to trying to spend his life to help others so so that was a that was that was many months ago that he and I connected and loosely kept in touch and kept track of Eros since we spent that wonderful day together and a family friend of his reached out to me on about a week ago letting me know Eero wasn't doing well and then they got in touch with me yesterday let me know that Errol had passed away if you watch the video below he doesn't seem sick which is it's even harder for me to really understand because um in any event he's no longer with us and you know anytime I experience a loss of life or someone I cared about our new goes away it just makes me really stop and think of what matters the most like what is most important and I love things like I get excited about all my stupid boosted boards and I get excited about like camera gear and I get excited about flying cars and and I get excited about work and I mean I'm a very I I can get obsessive about almost anything but but really what matters and the only thing that matters is my relationship are your relationships with other people something that I've I say a lot something I really believe in is that a life not shared is a life not lived if you don't share your life and share your happiness with other people and let other people into your life then are you really living then what's the point so I'm just taking pause today to stop and think about all the people in my life that I love and I appreciate and maybe you want to stop and just take a moment to think about the people in your lives that you appreciate because it's easy to get caught up in the and the and forget about what really matters I also just wanted to say I Romero's family friend they said that it was like his right up until the end he was mostly concerned with how he could help others so all linked cancer gogo which is arils nonprofit which his parents are maintaining to help kids and help people who were affected like he was I'll link that in the description below if you don't even give him a dollar they're trying to have everybody give him a dollar okay now I want to sing you a song yes sing all of you a song I'm not gonna really sing it's I can't sing but I want to share with you the lyrics of one of my favorite songs which for me puts things in perspective okay this song is called do you realize by the Flaming Lips and it's it's an incredible song but it goes this is part of it but it goes do you realize that everyone you know will someday die and instead of saying all of your good-byes let them know you realize that life goes fast it's hard to make the good things last you realize that the Sun doesn't go down it's just an illusion caused by the world spinning round okay [Music] life goes fast Hogman the good things I realize undone just in caused by the [Music] spinning",

three six eight hey this is mine yeah thank you [Music] so that's my unsolicited unasked-for commercial advertisement for think talking come grab yourself [Music] so much so much to talk about recently but let's have let's have this conversation up in the office [Music] remember the office up here the one by the bathroom the one where there was a hole here that went into the room there i'm happy to say the office is nearly complete ready first time ever sliding door dreams to comes through little steps out here you go we've got a secure ish railing it's the progress in the door [Music] see as of two weeks ago when I announced this new series and I announced the whole 368 initiative and all of our ambitions at that time all that existed was a big empty space and an idea and in the last two weeks it's evolved to a big empty space with some construction work done and a slightly more mature idea see when building something that has the the scale the ambition of what I and soon we are trying to do here at 3 6 8 it obviously takes time but there's also there's also a structure to how that time is spent and what the priorities are initial priorities in here are making it so we can actually work in here hence the office being nearly done and then another priority that's at the very very top is the team and we have made some progress on the team not ready to announce yet but there's a couple of key people that are now on or close to being on that will help me run and realize that the mission and and just operate this its operation what has been particularly interesting to me are what aspects of three six a people have been responding to the most whether it's on social media or in the comments on YouTube the one thing that stands out is this idea of enabling and helping small creators which is something that I'm tremendously passionate about but seeing out people react to that has been well it's been overwhelming overwhelming for a lot of reasons overwhelming because I know how to help creators when it comes to creators that maybe I stumble upon or seek me out that are just making incredible work I get excited and I talk about them and I share them with this audience they grow because of that that is not something that's scalable plugging people on this channel is not an effective way to grow a lot of people so figuring out what that infrastructure might look like what this idea of enabling others might actually feel like might actually be like that's something that I've been spending a lot of time thinking about and that is something that I think the future of 368 could be instrumental in the planning and the execution of every aspect of three six ages compartmentalised one piece get it done they move on to the next they move on to the next they move on to the next you build something small you see if that works you add on to that you see if that works you add on to that you see if that works you add on to that that's the effective way to build a business and that's exactly trying to do at 368 the hardest part of that for me is that it doesn't make for really interesting content I mean to show you the nuances everything is transpiring in 3 6 8 every single day would be about the video equivalent of showing you paint dry the steps are all tiny but in aggregate they're meaningful all things start small all great things start small cicero said that and that is that's that's what's going on right now at 368 from both the physical perspective and an ambition that you do it in an ambition perspective and everything in between but the train is moving forward we've got greater direction and understanding now and it seems like it feels like every day that passes by we have more clarity on how to execute on what we're trying to accomplish [Music] Jesse I got a serious question for you yes all right I know I've been yapping a lot today but I think it's time for me to answer the question that every single person the question that every single person on Twitter and in the youtube comments and everywhere else has asked which is why the suit there is not much of an answer like there's not much of a reason for me wearing a suit I guess it goes like this well you know what come here bring it when I was thinking of starting 3 6 8 and in starting a new Daily Show here I knew there'd be no disassociating this new daily vlog with my daily vlog from the past that's why all of you know me in the first place is from that vlog how does this feel different so one idea I had was like what if at the beginning I'm always wearing a suit and then at first glance you know that this is 3 6 8 and not the vols ok that's kind of it it's like there's not much more to it than that yes I'm a fan of Reservoir Dogs yes I think it's cool that the Yakuza wear the same outfit no I don't think it's cool that when I go to restaurants people think I'm a waiter no it's not really comfortable and then yesterday this is embarrassing but yesterday yesterday Candice finally admitted to me that uh she doesn't find the suit to be handsome anymore so that was kind of it I'm sorry there isn't a more intellectual response for why I'm wearing a suit there's not there's really not much more to it I think now that I've told you that I can probably stop wearing the suit I'm I am worried that once I don't have the suit on there'll be some confusion as to what it is you're watching but see this is from the old vlog so I think you're gonna get compute there better awesome I know I'll check I'll tell you all about this soon see I got a serious question for you yes should I put the suit back on people were starting to like question the suit and I'm doing a lot of peer pressure to stop wearing it what do you think don't stop the suit because you want to save out but every day looks good what about this sweatshirt this is more like that's nice too they give you one of these yet no yeah no yeah [Music] it's a brute Stood Still have you had your box of Ding Dongs yesterday I think I'm done with the suit [Music] on tomorrow's episode of three six eight back to work in my mouth ha ha [Music]",

of all we only be two and half hours from a family are we getting coffee yeah actually yeah I know this conversation about leaving New York City and moving somewhere else to be going on for a really

okay so for today's tech review Tuesday I got you juice thank you I got you juice all right let's see it's called love at first sight but look it's really it's like the healthiest healthy one they make yeah and this one is tasty too what is this it says your name on it Marlon no no I said you see this draw I love you yeah it looks nice right it looks exactly like you yeah okay I think that was for false starts now I can start tech review Tuesday dan roll the intro today in tech review Tuesday we're gonna talk to cell phones now I'm gonna be reviewing the one plus six which I just got not even opened yet before I do my general thoughts on cell phones as of June 2018 goes like this my favorite mobile phone operating system is pure Android running on the pixel 2 but I still carry an iPhone because an iPhone has iMessage and FaceTime which are the best messaging and video television on the market also the iPhone goes to the Apple watch which integrates pretty well with the running apps that I use my favorite cell phone camera is the samsung galaxy s 9 it's the best low it's just the best cell phone camera on the market right now but it's still not my favorite phone my favorite phone is still the Samsung Note 8 and it's the best because because it has a stylus and S Pen and it operates more like a computer than a phone and that makes it my favorite now a look at the 1 plus 6 [Music] right off the bat it's got one Hardware feature that I think should be required on every phone made and that has a physical switch that takes it from ringer to vibrate we're reaching a point with cell phones where at least from the front they all looked the same just kind of slide the glass curve the glass back on the oneplus does feel pretty sexy it's got a notch in the top right there like an iPhone one thing it does have that super interesting is that when you use the provided charger this thing goes from zero to a full day's charge in 30 minutes at least that's what they say just a quick thought for all cell phone manufacturers on planet Earth we as consumers will always prefer a slightly longer battery life to a phone that's like a millimeter thinner okay let's compare the size differences here are fairly negligible this is the one plus now as I was setting up the phone to go to a quick photo test I set up the facial recognition the facial scanner the face to unlock like the iPhone 10s it seems pretty great seems to work about as well as the iPhone 10 one thing it does have that the iPhone 10 does not have though is a fingerprint scanner and addition to the facial scanning so I like the idea of having that the redundancy in case I've got glasses or a motorcycle helmet or something blocking my face there's still the fingerprint scanner there now this is by no means a super comprehensive camera quality test but there's some amazing light out this afternoon so I'm just gonna take the same picture across these four phones that's the pixel to excel the iPhone 10 the Samsung Galaxy S 9 and then the one plus 6 and I can't stress how lovely the light is right now so I'm sure all these pictures gonna look great okay [Music] this is more of a challenging lighting condition this is to test out the dynamic range minigolf [Music] all right now I'm gonna do an indoor test I just need a I'll go get another juice so the lighting in here is like your typical indoor lighting so let's let's just the hard one all right so this would be the last photo test I do this is just your basic selfie photo nothing special about this I'm just gonna turn it on selfie smile and take a picture all right and that concludes the photo test portion of this review I gotta say out of this go back to the studio so overall the camera's not bad I think that compared to the pixel 2 or the iPhone 10 or the Samsung S 9 it's not quite as good these are the top cell phone cameras on the market right now and I think the the 1 plus 6 is is good it's definitely good enough it's definitely better than most cameras of last year's generation but it doesn't it doesn't take the prize for the best camera on the market so in conclusion in conclusion is that this is not a fully comprehensive review this was more of an unboxing because I just got this thing I'm going to take my sim card out of this and put it into this to test it out for the next week or so and I'll do a little update not as a tech review Tuesday but just as like a part of a different episode to let you know what I really think of this cell phones remain my single favorite piece of technology if you're interested in working in media youtuber filmmaker photographer you can literally build an entire career using nothing but your cellphone's alright I'll see you tomorrow on 3 6 8 [Music]",

you know I spent money I don't have and if I was throw me all the French's I don't grab but the water on the way down I don't contribute day 1 when you would say myself ok early morning bagel run I've got some kind of kind of bad news about 368 I mean sighs it's not that big of a deal but it just kind of sucks see construction was supposed to start today with like contractors and construction workers and plans and architects and all that stuff but I just found out last night that um there's like an issue with our insurance so we had to delay by like maybe a week maybe up to ten days I guess it's not that big of a deal it just kind of sucks but here at 368 we do things by the books we don't take chances we follow the rules now I have always said that the gear doesn't matter when it comes to telling stories making videos YouTube and everything in between the story you tell is always more important than what you used to tell it steven soderbergh big like Hollywood movie director he's the guy who directed Ocean's eleven and like 20 other huge movies he shot his latest feature film like a proper thriller movie theater horror movie he shot a lot of cell phone and he's famously said that the future of filmmaking is on cell phones and that's the vision I really subscribe to so I think it's something that that's accessible to all of us and it's also a very good segue to a new segment that's going to come to you every Tuesday here on three six eight called tech review Tuesday Dan roll your new sweet intro Casey asked me to make some sort of a kick-ass intro phrase tech Tuesday segment but I completely forgot I'm not really worried there because he's not gonna see this until this video goes alive next week's tech Tuesday intro sequence will be sick I promise hope you guys like that intro Dan's been working on it all week long all right now on Facebook I've been seeing this video pop up like had a really annoying video you notice for this hyper zoom lens that you can put on your cell phone [Music] and watching that just like there's no teen way that thing works so I went ahead and ordered one record of a better world together with you a lot of stuff in this box I got this whole kit off of Amazon for thirty-five dollars and 49 cents maybe that's why I'm so skeptical of it okay back to the unboxing [Music] at 35 bucks I just don't trust that if you have to do what they say it's gonna be able to do but I maintain open mind [Music] made it up before I'm giving me the dishes water and the cup don't get too much for this bins and there's two people around me acquaintances to the game and I'm enjoying someone chuck is over to a good man I'm enjoying someone's kids out which way to grin I mean it's a chilling April day Sam it's a little dramatic draw goggles face faster I need someplace like cinematic I think in the far into this pier so this goes on to here presumably like centered perfectly okay and now this just kind of screws on that on there oh and then one of those is an adapter maybe make it wider dude I can't believe you actually fell for like one of those Facebook ads like you see them all the time you're like that's just garbage it's like it's the new as-seen-on-tv thing but yeah you actually bought it and dude if you actually get this centered properly I let's test it all right so this you be a side-by-side comparison of the $35 Facebook infomercial lens on a cell phone in a $1000 super zoom lens on a TV $700 Canon camera body [Music] [Music] [Music] well color me impressed it's not a total piece of for 35 bucks as like sort of a gag but it it actually works that's the thing that you put it on and you can get what is a 20x zoom on here 18 X zoom shot diversity is wildly underrated when it comes to making YouTube videos and having a long lens is important and if all you have is a cell phone this could prove helpful so I very gently very reluctantly recommend this total piece of thirty-five dollar lens because it sort of almost works [Music] now we have a fun family activity planned for the afternoon I got a food that needs fell into some time to kill why don't you move me a key go by and I'll cover the bit cuz you know I'm gonna spend the money I don't have and if almost throw me all that branches I don't grab put the water in the bottom boil go ahead at the bottom and I'll float to the top bar right crystal commercial Liberty Science Center it's like a Children's Museum the trick to this place is you come about two hours before closing that way no one else is here Brandon what do I need to show my daughter in here how old is your daughter three three yeah she definitely needs to keep playing with the Train okay I would take her downstairs to the third floor go to eat erbium that's our miniature zoom and if she's over 42 inches you could definitely go on your penny come over here all right thank you you're welcome all right oh man I don't know who gave me two it could be you it could be someone else you could put it on yours or put it on the shelf I could go it alone or I could use some help I could bring you home or I could bring myself and if me to go I'll probably listen to you find myself all by myself again with nothing to do write it down this hall look I'm sorry honey you're not tall enough that's perfect [Music] oh you don't tell them hi is it Archer ready okay [Music] I'm tired and unsure as to whether to talk to you I tried before but only managed to Bajoran LA come you look so confident when you written that a bite song hard and flinch cuz I've been that what were you today man sleeping these edits are the best thing we've ever done the best thing work we've ever done now you bite hard on bright shots and finds myself on tomorrow's episode of three six

Candace's family and he really like showed me around Cape Town and showed me all the awesomeness that kid that had to offer and when he told news come to New York City I kind of promised and I'd be like his tour guide I'd show them around and one aspect of that I've just been absolutely failing at is showing them good places to eat so today I take the end of my favorite breakfast restaurant as part one of its 50 part series called KC die sets guide to out-of-towners to me she's you know sets guide to New York City are you ready for this no I don't even know what you're getting the best breakfast in New York City yes I got all this I got all this herb I got I got all the syrup I got all the serve I got I got all the Sara that juice dan how was it that was incredibly delicious but if I keep on eating like this I'm gonna be like Rob - I'll see you at 360 trying to keep away from existentialism John and Earth are trying to keep away from issues flip on the off since walk in the park of discovery I will now read a monologue I didn't write this monologue but it's pretty spot-on [Applause] [Music] so the person who emailed me this morning with a perfectly nice request I'm sorry to say the answer is no you didn't do anything wrong you were perfectly respectful within your rights to ask about arranging a time for a meeting see but the problem isn't you there's something wrong with me I have a form of anorexia don't be alarmed it's not serious although I take it quite seriously in fact in fact I think it's the secret to all of my success I have calendar anorexia I want as little in my calendar as possible I'm meticulous about it whatever the least amount possible I can have in my calendar without killing my entire career that's what I want I want to set up quick call to chat want to have coffee next week let's get together to discuss no no and no I could but I just can't even if there are serious opportunities even if the only take me 15 minutes even if it's something that everyone else does I like to avoid it of course I'm not perfect at this I do succumb just like everybody else in the modern world there are things that I have to do and and those things have to be scheduled there are requirements for work and basic civility but even then when I pull up my phone and I click on today's date and I see little boxes of time blocked out I get very nervous I get anxious what is all this where did my time go what about my day why did I agree to all of this and then the most fearful question how will I be able to make my video you see my entire day is my vlog time I can't schedule that and if I do schedule that away it better be because I'm getting paid or I really want to do it because everything else everything else is for suckers see you've got managers and you got makers there are two ways to run your life managers know that their days divided up into little itty-bitty pieces for meetings calls and administrative tasks makers on the other hand makers need to have large blocks of uninterrupted time to focus on what it is they're making when people ask how I'm able to get these videos done every single day my calendar and erect SIA is the answer same goes the house able to manage a healthy relationship with my wife and my family and how I manage to exercise and read time time is our most irreplaceable asset we can't buy more of it we can't get a second of it back we can only hope to waste as little of it as possible while we have it yet somehow we treat it as the most renewable of all resources so if the ask is if we can get together and chat or pick my brain the answer is no I'm sorry but I have this condition I hope you understand okay I didn't write that it's not amazing my friend Ryan Holliday is a brilliant writer he's the one who wrote that he's good so I said hi and while I'm not as Extreme as like that letters written there's a lot in there that I do agree with after time with my family and focusing on my family this blog is my number one priority and it does make it hard or frustrating what's up harder frustrating to try and have meetings or give time to everybody who asks for some of my time but every once in a while there's a really good exception to that rule what's up Casey my name is jack conte I am the CEO of patreon but actually this is not a patreon video this is just me and you I've got an idea and I want to talk to you [Music] this is it Casey this is it I'm asking for 50 minutes of your time just you and me so I can explain this idea and I hope you're down because I already bought my plane ticket so if you're not I'm gonna be really lonely on Thursday in New York if you are down just write a comment in this youtube video that just says yes and I'll figure out how to get in touch a few up that video was made by a guy named jack conte now I don't know Jack I don't know who he is I've never met him as far as I know I've never seen the guy before and before I could gather from that video he wants something from me but that video was just so so good that I got to meet the guy how good was it well it was so good that the video itself went viral it was so good that he recruited people all over the internet to petition me just to go meet him it was so good so good that the man right now is outside my office door holy crap oh my oh my god I wish everybody could see what it looks like in here this is Jack what's up Jack woody what do you want what do I want what do you want that is so important that you made a video that's that good to get my attention well ultimately what I want is I want creative people to be valued what they're actually valued at I want I want there to be a zero gap between what a creative person is worth and the money that they are given by the world that's the noble mission yes I want all creators to be able to make a living doing what they love which is I assume creating so how do you realize that well just a pitch for patreon no I don't want to pitch me okay okay Jack is the CEO of a company called patreon patreon patreon patreon is a site if you don't know we're like let me know if this is the fare carry it to it yeah patreon is a site where you can like make your own account and then if people like you and they like your YouTube channel they can subscribe to you on patreon and support you by that good yeah they give you much like it's like a you get a membership platform wait I I don't like to I can't why don't you find my pitch but not like this do you want to fill in the pitch can you give it a brief yet it fits my audience they're dying to know this video Jack had 11,000 subscribers he uploaded this video to his channel it went crazy viral it did 600 700 thousand views you're up to fifty nine hundred thousand views nine hundred thousand views you know how many subscribers you are now 50 thousand and fifty thousand people are so curious to hear what you wanted to share with me I need to I have I'm a storyteller Casey I have I built a whole story you're on an elevator with my with my 9 million subscribers you want them to believe in what you're sharing pink bum you've got 14 floors go okay this is like Shark Tank Casey three six eight guys the potential to be most badass media company in the world the old-school style amazing media companies I'm talking about like the late the labels that actually helped developed an artist help them reach an audience help them make money that's what three six eight can actually do you're talking about helping small creators three six eight can be a platform for small creators like no black record label in the world can actually do you can actually help people find and build an audience literally no one in the world can do that three six eight is positioned to be literally a historical media company that can help connect people with the world okay so here's the patient go here's the pitch this is I need to tell you my story I need I need my deck okay okay guys so far this is pretty impressive stuff coming from Jack we're gonna go ahead and hit pause so I can read his deck now I'm gonna turn the camera off turn the camera off attach in the camera all right that was an hour of the two of us talking I feel like progress was made we made a lot of progress 1 2 3 6 8 let's see 3 6 8 welcome to 3 6 8 oh my god [Music] so this is the main space and obviously we're gonna use this space for like collabs and just like a party space in a physical space up here there that's with no no behind you that's where the office is being built see them up there the constructions almost done up there progress is being made dude it's so weird to actually be here so you can imagine like this is where I wanted to podcast and set up back here out there I don't know but I feel like downstairs is about post-production clean organized and upstairs about like horsing around and action you can see the vision right baby's down you know like the office is built the office is a reality now and then we're gonna start working on down here and then upstairs and then and how long is it going to take to actually get the facility up and running weeks and months but not longer than that this isn't a this isn't a five-year plan this is like a couple month to it glad somebody else appreciates this phase as much as I do so I think while the good news is I don't know it's not that we have a deal or don't have a deal but what Jack came here to present is wildly exciting and I could see it I do see it I want it to be a big part of three six eight future so what do you think I think I'm pretty excited right now appreciate you thank you sir this is very exciting this is all about the future of 368 and what we could do together and I'm spinning I gotta go on tomorrow's episode of three six eight [Music]",

I don't understand why you had me cut it open and I wish you luck with your YouTube channel thanks for the pillows Paula hope the air nanos ah their headphones expect a comprehensive okay this is what I was looking for all right so like literally two years ago 2015 when I was first trying to fly drones and this vlog and I didn't actually fly drones I would just crash drones in every single episode I'll just crash the drones my sauce video for a drone that was super portable it's super easy to fly and all that stuff so I bought it right i pre-ordered it and this is snap the world's first fully portable 4k flying two years later it has shown up this will now be a comprehensive review [Music] you know the thing that excited me the most was it small compact size at the time the only drone out there was like the Phantom three which is pretty enormous and this seemed tiny but in between the tiers since they announced it and shipped it DJI has really stepped up their game this thing doesn't seem so small anymore but uh let's fly it I'm headed to a safe place to fly the drone in Brooklyn away from any potential dangers because I'm a responsible non-commercial amateur drone just fa please don't give me a hard time about this I'm just trying out a new toy [Music] we're out here in Brooklyn now a nice safe place to fly and this is kind of the biggest selling point it's how easy it's supposed to fit into a backpack your body the camera right there battery and then I'm assuming it's called the snap because all right ready look it folds out and then this white module which is where the camera is and whatnot this kind of snaps in snaps battery snaps on whoa it's not bad right I was like what the hell are you gonna do with all those parts no that's it like no screws nothing and then it automatically turns on I think I couldn't find the power button but it made a noise then you trying to put it down there's no skis no feet you just like put it down there right on the battery hi nice nice to meet you a lot of friendly people here in Brooklyn she was she's doing pretty much she's struggling pre-med premed now it does have an Android in an iPhone app but I was recommended to use the iPhone app because the Android app is still in beta so there's no controller no controller okay GPS connected let's fly no way yeah but I'm not getting an image oh here we go [Music] watch that fence watch that bad Jesus how does it feel it's not holding its position very well it's a little drifting but it looks like it just caught GPS see it's staying in one spot right now okay it's way out over the water do you see it it's accelerometer based yeah are you even controlling her right now there it goes do you feel like you have any control are you trying to bring it back I still can't quite have it going up higher I don't know how to make it cutter a home but I'm trying to fly it will nothing happen side way yeah I'm I'm really struggling with the controls here and I'm doing everything it's said to do there it is Wow [Music] it landed you caught it I didn't feel like I had a whole lot of control but in in this thing's defense the first time I flew a spark with the phone the first time I used a parrot the parrot one which requires the phone basically any drone I've ever used where the control is limited to the phone I've never had any control you're trying to touch class and use an accelerometer and it's just a it's just this guy right here who we do not know is flying a Mavic the Mavic is probably the the biggest competitor to this to the snap the snaps $899 the Mavic is roughly the same price I think it's $9.99 with the controller the Mavic is in my opinion one of the greatest drones ever made so today I'm talking me through details here talking to putting your songs on a glass screen to control a thing like this is not good you want tactile buttons you want to feel what you're you're doing and this is just like the accelerometer control is very responsive if I will say and that actually works and then it's got a gimbal too which is pretty impressive stabilized gimbal but we'll have to see how that video looks it didn't look very promising from the feet on the phone now we'll go check out what the footage looks like [Music] all right so I gotta say that the footage looks fantastic I think the footage is amazing the stabilization is buttery smooth the image is at least as good as the Mavic but when it comes to drone cinematography the image quality is secondary on the list of importance after cinematography if you can't get like the perfect dynamic shots that you want what does it matter if it's a little bit smoother or the colors a little bit more rich my problem with this drone is the same problem that I had with the DJI spark before I had the controller you just cannot control a drone which is there are six axes plus the axis of the camera using a touchscreen phone but in conclusion my review of the snap drone is that it's a very very interesting device but the control and competence you have over the actual device is extremely limited now YouTube audience I don't ask you for much besides buy my new merch I do need your help to help me commit make I need your help with the Christmas miracle okay my friend Sam's 2017 goal was to get to a hundred thousand subscribers he helps me with all my videos he's a

            "data": "[Music] okay that's it needle is in the arm does this hurt you as much as it hurts me Roger no Oh [Music] you [Music] [Applause] so you've seen you've seen that footage before I've talked about I've talked about in this vlog a number of times when I went to Afghanistan as a journalist I went there with my friend Scott Campbell who's this fantastic tattoo artist and he and I we linked up with these special forces guys these US Air Force pararescue jumpers and we set up a tattoo parlor in the middle of the warzone now there's one soldier in particular named Roger you've seen him on this vlog before and when we were there we tattooed Roger and he was the most kind of emotional about the process he himself when he got back he started tattooing he started giving people tattoos and he's now a pretty successful tattoo artist soldier we met in the war zone gave a tattoo to it was such an emotional experience for him that he is now a tattoo artist [Music] a lot of heat - thank you I go on the Brooklyn that's a surprise man if you have a good weekend morrow they said you promised to teach Rosa Blasi I'm going to keep you out of love Marlon you can count on me [Music] so this year this is saved tattoo this is Scott Campbell the guy that I was in Afghanistan with the tattoo artists this is his tattoo shop and he's not here but look at this guy welcome please it's good the reader you look like a tattoo artist today what is new uh oh yeah yeah Michelle did that the last night is meant for you Roger you're running out of canvas I am the chart spot [Music] the players [Music] now drive play that play yes we want to go yeah but you know just kind of treatment really do see because if you do this familiars this is Roger start that tattoo artists not Roger the soldier and what he and I are doing to sort of merging our experience together as human beings in Afghanistan and then now our strains together as artists is that fair oh yeah yeah it's very articulate I mean it's emotional for me to sit here and think about tattooing you because it wasn't for you and Scott and whatever you want to call serendipity in life I wouldn't be here doing this for you you know meeting you guys in Afghanistan like we did is what I'm hearing [Music] punishing and [Music] it's just unreal man the timing you know how things work out you know I'm not a religious guy but I feel like I'm a very spiritual guy and I've been in the military the special operations for like 20 years and just the timing and the way this is all worked out is a pretty phenomenal it [Music] it's it's really heavy stuff I mean maybe I was just at a point in my career to where needing you guys affected me the way that it did but it definitely I was open to the change in the the risk of dive and ends so in any of that long very long Rodgers tattooing me here [Music] understand what does said you were kind of talking about traditional spot for something a date/time stamp would be on the ridge I've waited that symmetrical [Music] see I've always wanted Roger to tattoo me and I've always waited to the right excuse I don't really care what the tattoo is my feeling on tattoos in general is is it's what they represent more than a sort of artistry that's why all mine are just really terrible lines it's a pretty special experience for for me I hope for him too you know what's really interesting about that sometimes you can be what are we saving ourselves for you know Roger shaving me down tattooing it was kind of awkward to shame another man but it's given us used to doll not that good or bad I mean I mean it's obviously a good thing now you just initiate my army nor shave my whole body ah we need a privacy screen I'm more than happy to shave your whole body all right on my wife beater on I'm going to go ahead and get comfortable here now the idea was for Roger to do a small tattoo on me but we just kept making it ten percent bigger and ten percent bigger and ten percent figure we're going pretty big okay that's it needle is in the arm [Music] beautifully I can't we're having a great time it's uh you know we've got to see each other over the years but I don't think anything really is intimate well I guess there are other things but this is very identified as we're gonna get and so I'm enjoying to be able to give back and do something personal for you with all the things you've done for me [Music] they could mean nothing or they can mean everything but what's really interesting is it's bringing something very intangible tangible if not just for the ritual of it but for what you're gonna be left with you know for the rest of your long we're almost done we're done rods where are we the gun stop we're on the just clean up a little bit because it's what you do what I like it I'm Casey Casey all right a little bit of Ross I like yeah I can't be here I'm gonna clean up speech and all I asked for Roger before he started the tattoo was to kind of do what he wanted to do Roger I'm wondering if you can explain to the audience what this is and what it means you know with my long military career I guess you know I've always been very drawn to samurai culture and one of the things that the samurai would adorn themselves with were paintings within samurai culture they knew they would never have this proper burial and so they wanted to kind of like celebrate the beauty of their life while being alive and so they would adorn themselves in peonies and just kind of botanicals and so this is a peony that I drew up this uh I've tattooed on people just the dearest human beings in my life it means a lot to me to be able to put it on you and I've actually got it tattooed on me this is an outline as well so just to be cool and I didn't want any shading or any color I just wanted to line yep through there thanks Roger yeah oh man yeah this is so the one request I did have from Rogers that he had to sign it he had to sign my tattoo and this is it that's the peony in the master signature and that's the peony and then that's the signature you're stuck with me forever now Roger gladly like I'm in a couple of other movies about my tattoos and how I feel about tattoos and the basic premise of those videos is that tattoos for me are about making permanent a moment or an experience in your life that's why like half of my tattoos are literally just dates or notes so I want to remember something and for the rest of my life but I see that mark on my body I want to think of that moment and this gigantic awesome samurai peony that Roger just gave me really represents like you know Rogers one of the most extraordinary human beings ever met in my entire life in the experience of knowing him the circumstances with which we met it's a delicate art of my life and who I am and that's what this is about all right Roger I want to thank you again you are a brilliant artist sir [Music]",

this morning he is gonna be joining me on my run not as easy as it's been doing great dude it's doing great yeah you're done yeah whoo yeah okay I'll see you good job Dan gotta start somewhere and you did what [Music] bam bam bam wha-bam wha-bam ha be a and f BAM AB imp is a bad mother and today on three six eight I'm gonna introduce you to one of the world's greatest BAM this is Paul what's up Paul tell us a little bit about yourself ah you're about to meet a man who barely survived a shark attack and is now an inspiration to all of us three years ago Paul de Gelder was with the Australian Navy part of an elite dive team on a dive to test new counterterrorism hardware and then he was suddenly attacked by a bull shark I'm Australian I opened up for Snoop Dogg in 1998 which was pretty cool wait and what capacity did you open up for Snoop Dogg I was a rapper if I YouTube searched I find a video of you rapping you can't find a video but you can find the song on iTunes what's it called pop it's smoking hydro literally took the album's ago please welcome Paul de Gelder [Music] it was the epitome of a shocky day it was early in the morning Sydney Harbour so murky water it was overcast I was on my back in a black wetsuit and black fins kicking my leg a bull shark came up from underneath me and grabbed me by the leg and the hand in the same bite decided it wanted them more than I did and started tearing me apart and took me underwater in total agony drowning me losing blood nearly dead ripped out my hamstring and took off my hand and so I had to swim back to my safety boat missing a hand and part of my leg through a pool of my own blood where my buddies were waiting to give me first day [Music] and they did that they kept me alive one of the guys had to stick his hand inside my leg and pinch closed one of the arteries and a week later I decided to have the leg removed because I couldn't feel it I couldn't move it it was gonna be useless for the rest of my life so I just thought stuff that I'll just get them to turn me into a terminator how did you swim with no arm and no leg slowly but I know we get trained to deal with very stressful situations how do they train you to deal with a situation that that was that was you know up a few tears from what I was used to but the medical training kicked in and I thought okay my hands missing I'm bleeding I've got to keep that wound above my heart so I'm swimming like that with one arm out of the water kicking one leg because I couldn't even feel the other leg and just going really slow at the same time the guys in the play are coming over towards me I didn't even think I was gonna make it I thought the shark was gonna come back it was gonna grab you by the ankle take me down and kill me so it didn't matter all I had to do was just keep trying until that happened show us your how does this work so this is called the Michelangelo it's a made in Germany it's about $19,000 for this thing I think it's the best robotic hand in the world but mostly just because I can change it from this grip to beer-drinking grip if you're gonna have a $90,000 robot arm it might as well have a beer-drinking group so the first time I met Paul was this past summer and you had on pants so I didn't see your leg yeah and he's just like a like Jack tattoo dude and I went and shook his hand ready okay but when you grab on there's like a proper squeeze there well that's still the go grip though what's fun but it's not painful but if I don't know you or you've been a bit of a dick I may just squeeze down a little bit extra and wait for the flicker in your eyes I think you just right like you have me you could do it everyone the last time the the version before this I had chillie snapped in half armwrestling unfortunately you were armwrestling with a prosthetic hand like that with a girl there may have been some product oral damage there was some cracks in it because I'm pretty hard on this I'm about as hard on my prosthetics as you are on everything so I lost the hand and the leg if I was gonna lose just one it would not be a hand take the leg take the leg you can replace a leg so I've got a running blade I've got a swimming leg I've got a diving leg I've got this amazing $200,000 leg but you cannot replace a hand not yet there's no Luke Skywalker hand out yet and what allows you to get back in the water three months later what is it from inside of you that lets you do that it's a deep love for being in the water for me I don't think you can get any closer to being an actual part of nature than being completely submerged in the ocean it's relaxing it alleviates stresses and fears and you feel relaxed and it can wash away a lot of the stresses that are impacted on you throughout your life have you met Arnold Schwarzenegger yeah yeah I know him huge knowledge to you that you're closer to the Terminator than he ever is not quite [Music] [Music] water why one fall on a good life what do I want a bad love and a good life is gonna win every time I I was always that there was two things I was afraid of in life sharks and public speaking now I make shock documentaries to Shark Week and I'm a public speaker so you never know what life has in store for you you just get like literally your biggest weaknesses can become your biggest strengths if you just face them head-on all this amazing stuff came out of the worst thing that has ever happened to me in my life [Music] [Music] look this is this is the new 368 mascot but this clickbait sooo good we're going to save this for another episode how many pull-ups he do for how many pull-ups can you do Aaron fine really so Paul we're gonna have Dan do a contest first Aaron and then you and I are gonna head your head is that sound good okay so what was the count let's not do this and eat that whole entire seed okay so that's this weather the shark took it off from but this is what we were discussing before why I have problems with the camera because I can't hold it with my right hand that's what you have to do yeah that can pass and then you like you when you're moving your arm you're fucking with the zoom and the you can't grip it there's no way to hold mine camera company it's figure this out what do I do and this is what I use if anyone tries to mess with me as well one two man no not even slowing down eighteen nineties yes effects okay it's good these three James describes one two ten eleven are you you nearly halfway [Music] good luck with the new goals of facing up against whoa I'm gonna try I'm never gonna reach 30 pull-up level but I'm going to try fire and good to see you bye guys okay that's one badass motherfucker indeed [Music] you",

the situation you see the video I put out like two days ago about the flooding in Houston and hurricane Harvey the one that had Candace's dad my father-in-law in it that's super important context super important context because in that video you see Candace my wife her dad Stanley explained how he was trapped in his house in Texas during the floods he had to climb through the roof and he shows his leg and it's all bruised he literally lost his home due to a flood it's been kind of a rough week for Stanley all right so here's the situation Stanley turned 70 it's his 70th birthday this week now all the same wanted for his birthday was to go on a family trip with his with his daughters and his two grandchildren the trip has been planned for the better part of the last nine months and the trip the family trip this is his idea is to go on a cruise a cruise ship a cruise boat that's a Disney cruise boat you know like Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck and all that and that cruises you to leave in two days from Florida all right category five hurricane winds still 185 miles an hour on top of that Francine's been so excited and we bought her all the stuffed animals and shoes and flip-flops and all that stuff just for this trip that's now maybe going to be canceled so the vlogs of this week are gonna be entirely dedicated to whether or not we go on that trip [Music] remember my sunglasses that had the purple lenses these ones those glasses well I lost them swimming in the ocean at my friend's birthday party I really missed them so I ordered another pair off of Amazon they came this week but I think they're counterfeit here's where things get fishy the texture of these does not feel right on top of that they feel a little too flexible and this shade of purple seems a little darker than how I remember it so what I don't think these counterfeiters realize is that they're selling these glasses to someone who literally lives in a pair of Raven glasses and I can tell when they feel different and these feel different I don't think they're legit now I did weigh them against my other glasses and they check out exactly 35 grams and when I check all the details like the Markel's they're the etching into the the logo on the side and even the text on the inside of the arm that that all checks out but I I can't place it they just don't feel right also the receipt that came with it said if there's any problem with this package don't contact Amazon contact us directly it seemed a little Shady fashion shoot behind me here this is the official raven's Soho flagship store I'm hoping I can get to the bottom of this suspected counterfeit inside the store here this is not an advertisement for a band at all in fact I'm not a fan of Ray Ban the brand that's why I scratch their labels off of all my sunglasses but they are the ones who make these glasses so it always seems appropriate what's up man my name is Dmytro dot no limit on that I'll just go man's on 150 Instagram cat under school camisa you can count on me gentlemen you can count on me no purple okay I've got a question for it I bought these on the internet I think they're bullsh I think that these are counterfeits I think they're really good counterfeits but I think they're counterfeit I did that look good we go by the fonts on the inside so one thing I'm so sorry we can't do like all right so they're convinced these glasses are legit but they didn't do a very thorough inspection and honestly I still think they're bogus so this segment the counterfeit glass segment will happy to be continued I need to find a real expert on Raven it's the new videomic pro from road they used to only use this microphone but I got frustrated with her or something I stopped usually this is the new one they're supposed to fix all the short company okay ready tell me if this sounds any different you're now listening to the old mic and you're now listening to the new mic how does it sound better more clear this is what the old mic look like this is also rode mic I like this microphone I like the shock mount look I broke it and had to tape it but I do like this doesn't take any batteries expect a full comprehend [Music] are we or are we not going on the 70th birthday family vacation that this week but have they said if our cruise ships canceled which is really step like what if people need to get medications for more than five days honey and you do best assessment are these counterfeit yes I they're kind of tight um to the store and they said they're not counterfeit they just look really cheap right so what's the verdict fake okay all right well thank you so much for letting us know so we just wait to hear from the travel agent or what happened Disney Cruise canceled no so I do just want to say since since I recorded this vlog episode it's like two days ago that hurricane hurricane Irma has has hit land on a couple of islands in Puerto Rico and it looks like it's headed for Florida and it is proven to be like an absolutely devastating devastating storm so my stupid vacation to go see Mickey Mouse doesn't really matter but lots of thoughts and and really just best wishes for anyone and everyone who's in the trajectory of this storm and is being affected by this like deadly truly terrifying storm",

go outside for some practical tests of these boards I just want to go over some of the technical specifications looking at their websites they're super super similar so the two sport says it goes 20 miles an hour boosted board says it goes 22 miles an hour this thing says has a seven mile range boosted says it has a six or seven mile range regenerative braking dual motors regenerative braking dual motors honestly even the juice website looks like the boosted board website but for like a side-by-side spec analysis they seem to be very or lease advertised as very very similar I did want to do a flex test [Music] all right this is the Flex test on the $1500 boosted board 100% bamboo deck look at that flex flex and this is the Flex Omni um it's actually for 49 is for the cheap one 599's for the dual motor version of the juice so I take that but I said this is a five hundred and $99 board not at $499 board all right this is the Flex test on the bamboo and maple juice board exactly not that bad and you can't flex as much that hits this battery and it's it does feel more rigid but it flexes a lot more than I had expected it to so what Sam go outside now right yell to it okay let's joy I'm gonna have Sam carry the extra board because well he offered to and you're cool that alright yeah it's alright if you're wondering why we're carrying the juice board it's cause like I want to ride it for the first time on camera and in New York City we got to make sure we're somewhere we can like ride safely where there's not too many people we're going to carry it to a safe less crowded part of the city test it there all right so now we're deep deep on Manhattan's West Side there's like some thuggish looking dudes over there that are smoking pot I'm not going to film them they look a little scary over here we've got the ups fulfillment center this is a good place to test the board that is a guy's smoking pot all right this is it this is the first powering up of the juice board great turn on fine no problem all right well I'll tell you this much it's a lot quieter than the boosted board start off with the speed test yeah acceleration test yeah a very important detail here NYPD this is chalk and washes away with water this is not vandalism because it's temporary please don't show up to my house or office and we're trying to arrest me again okay that's going to be our starting line there [Music] I'm on the juice board that's the boosted board ready yep one two three okay well this is the initial ride of the juice board and acceleration not great [Music] would that look like in your perspective I didn't even see it you were gone in half a second all right next test is going to be the high speed to the top speed test how do we even do this I'm gonna go as fast as I can say I'm gonna try and keep up now I'm on the juice board I'm on the cheap board the $449 board so that's been 10 seconds this is probably top speed come on man when it comes to top speed test again the juice board was absolutely creamed by the boosted board now this next test this is going to be the braking test how quickly they stopped my chalk line which is right here which is washable chalk not vandalism remember that it's not vandalism this chalk line right here we're going to start all the way down there at that truck come full speed to the line here and then hit the brakes as soon as we hit this line and see how far past the line we go before we stop three two go all right so we did that test five times and quite frankly the brakes on this aren't that bad like Busan weren't definitely stopped so windy stop more aggressively and more effectively but it's not like the acceleration test like I would say that stops in about 15 feet of less distance than this stops kind of amazing this kid just came up on a Busan word yeah what's your name Casey how long have you been riding your booster board I had it since day one try out this juice board just like take it up and down the street let me know your honest thoughts compared to the boosted board all right cool all right so this is the unbiased stranger we met in the street who's a veteran boosted board rider test I think that like what's the rest what about the booster for you can go on reverse this you can't really do that anything like getting on like those little edges when you're turning the boost is just like super smooth like this I feel like I kind of like out of it I drift a little bit the verdict here is that I would say that screw support is better but I would say it I'm bad for you don't think it's bad okay thank you for your help nice to meet you and you sir I promised him I'd buy him the smoothie help me with this video fair trade all right so the conclusion from the tests in the real world is that it's not as bad as I expected but it's nowhere near as good as this but for 500 bucks you're getting a pretty good for this isn't garbage it's not garbage I would not call it pretty good though in conclusion this thing works it's fine I guess it is impressive that they're able to do it for such a low price but just know one thing this is not a boosted board this is a cheap knockoff of a boosted board this this is a toy and if you're fine buying a toy then it's a good value for a toy but it's a little bit like wanting a high-performance sports car like wanting a Ferrari boosted board being the Ferrari instead of getting a Ferrari you get a used old Hyundai used old Hyundai's fine I might even get you from A to B but if you want a hybrid if you want a Ferrari don't buy a Hyundai and then paint a dramatically similar logo to the Ferrari on this side and expect that cheap knockoff to perform like a Ferrari also I crashed my new spark drone into a tree and fell

long naps it's been real [Music] Oh summer is nearing its unwelcomed end and for those of you who know me at all you know that I get severely depressed and turned into a total freakout monster at the end of the summer on top of that Candis is getting more pregnant every minute of every day and her ability to move is dwindling so we decided this past weekend that we would go out to the beach shoe today is Friday and we are taking a little family trip to the beach for one day we come back tomorrow Francine are you excited what are you most excited about Candice is getting snacks right now what's taking Bobby so long she doesn't know we'll have to see we are about two hours into the drive I'm no longer allowed to drive because I'm a terrible driver so I'm in the back of the kid how much further franciene what's that thing called no a windmill look there's the ocean we're at the beach hey we made it is the hotel we're staying at we leave tomorrow is kind of a lot of driving for one night that's okay Francine and Candice hurry up there I carry this stuff I'm not on the dad [Music] yeah that's four days almost over but I'm gonna go for a little swim in the pool before the Sun sets I know this is shaping up to be a great vlog it but well we woke up the next morning [Applause] Beach tripping our raindrip the rain never stopped ended up just being mommy daddy and Frannie hanging around in a hotel room for 24 hours it was lovely but I thought I would use this opportunity of having a failed episode to share with you a kind of a story okay this is it if 4.8 more and I got it wait 4.7 more and I got it so believe it or not I love to run and I don't know I've been what's why I get these sort of freak outs I'm getting so old I'm 37 I start to feel like an old man I don't know it probably is irrational but I wanted to challenge myself to see what I was like see what I was capable of to see where I far I could push my body because it's just gross out and my shoes are wet but for miles nobody I'll sleep through this and I think unless you test yourself you don't really know what you're capable of so you know I run a lot I run like 40 50 60 miles a week which is a lot of miles in a week and I wanted to give myself a real challenge so a marathon is 26.2 miles so three marathons would be 70 what is 26.2 times three so three marathons is seventy eight point six miles so I thought why not try to do in seven days from Sunday until Saturday in seven days try to run the equivalent of four marathons that is 104 point eight miles in order to do this it means running about 15 miles a day which is a lot this is kind of tough it's late we're on vacation this weekend it's like 10:00 at night the kid just went to sleep now 2:13 this morning but if I want to get across that threshold I gotta get in at least five more right now which means that when we have to do 14 more tomorrow no 19 more tomorrow got to do it it was I think the hardest part of giving yourself such a stupid challenge was finding the time see I saw the kid and the pregnant wife at home I still have a job I still I still uploaded five videos last I had to figure out how to run a hundred and five miles in addition to living my normal life and it was a lot to do these late-night miles are so tough everybody's like out partying exhausted it's 10:45 now I'm glad I'm clocking miles I'm like stacking chips right now those miles are just piling on you know I'm 37 years old and like this leg here this is all made from titanium because of a motorbike accident like 10 years ago and I'm not supposed to be running and I don't stretch and look oh I can't even touch my toes I've broken half the bones in my body I've got a lot of problems but for whatever reason I have like a broken chromosome where I can just run I never got tired my legs never got tired my lungs never got tired my stomach never got tired the only thing that would happen every single day is that run out of time Candice would be caller I have to get to work or a meeting or something like that that was hugely positive you like driving old car cause it's 37 years old and then you like hit the gas and it just goes for us you're like my car still works my car's still worse [Music] no rain pouring right right now rain is not an excuse you know run right through it okay 104 point eight miles got it my wife made fun of me she called me a sociopath maybe a psychopath I don't remember very well Franny all right kids this is it four more miles and I will have done it it's almost like carrying a child to be their birth so proud of you I'm really glad I did it and I think that in weather something silly like how far can you run or anything else in life it was a reminder for me of the importance of challenging yourself you know challenging yourself doesn't always have to be climbing a mountain or running around the world they're doing something wild and ambitious but for me it was just about putting out my sneakers and getting out there and seeing what I was capable of physically and for that I think my biggest takeaway was just a greater appreciation of the fact that I am extremely lucky to be 37 and have a body that's capable that lets me do what I want to do where I can still do these kinds of things it makes me want to eat better and don't eat better and sleep more I still don't sleep that much and just be more responsible with my body because it's something that I hope to never lose [Music] all right that's like five and a half miles I think that puts me at a hundred and five point one or something for the week which means victory is mine I did it four marathons seven days 105 plus miles all right that's it I did it 105 miles I want to end this by saying I want to say this publicly I want to say this on the record I want you to hold me accountable for this my next self-imposed completely unnecessary challenge is going to be to run seven marathons in seven days that's like 160 miles in seven days but a marathon a day for a week I want to do that sometime next couple years hold me to it we're going home tonight but we came all the way to the beach to go to the beach rain or shine we're going to be ready [Music] ah all right I'll see you tomorrow after my ride [Music] you",

            "data": "okay people keep asking what's up with my CNN thing so I thought I'd make a quick video explaining what's up with my CNN thing I want to start with a little bit of historical context you know to shape the story out all right the CNN thing this is a brief history so in early 2015 I founded a technology company called beam with Matt Hackett he was my partner then at the end of March that year I launched the vlog the purpose of the vlog initially was just to talk about me starting a new company and then it spiraled into something bigger and then summer 2015 mid-june we publicly launched being the app a video sharing app like snapchat or Instagram or something like that and largely driven by the popularity of the vlog and I think people liked the idea of being downloads skyrocketed the app did really really well through summer and then slowly falling following and not recovering we had a good app we had a great idea but snapchat was better and Instagram was a better idea we got our asses kicked then some summer 2016 not now we're trying to figure out the future of the company was CNN bought bean now a lot of people ask why would CNN buy a failed video sharing app well they didn't buy the app they bought the technology company that was behind that app there's a tremendous amount of value in putting together a team and building a company in the infrastructure and the IP that we create there's a lot of value behind that one app and that's what CNN was interested in there are also interested in me because of what I'd done on the blog now one very important distinction I've said this before but a very important distinction CNN did not buy and does not own in any capacity this YouTube channel my youtube channel that was not part of the deal I'll always continue to post wherever the hell I want to post on this channel beam CNN separate entities and that's the history portion of this video what's beam up to now so we that is me and Matt and our new partners from CNN spent the first part of this year kind of defining what it is we wanted to do and we knew we wanted to continue in technology we knew we wanted to introduce more media that is like videos and movies and YouTube and and want to build something completely new the old beam that app that we killed has nothing to do with the new company but we still have the same people the same team we've actually been hiring quite a bit our team now is well it's you [Music] and something that's super important understand is that CNN owns being but we operate separately so CNN's in this gigantic glass tower in Midtown and we work out of an old fucked up former furniture store in Chinatown CNN has like a gazillion employees and they wear suits and stuff like that we we work in a basement in Chinatown so we really do operate on our own and that's not to say if we start screwing up that's and I might not step in but so far we still run this company like a startup we want to make all kinds of shows all kinds of content we want to release a lot of it here on YouTube but we're also not against like trying other platforms newer platforms but we're starting here on YouTube just parenthetically we haven't launched the YouTube channel yet I'll let you know but there's no we're not up yet the first show we want to launch we're calling beam news and we want it to be like it'll probably four days a week when we launched it we want to get it to seven days a week I'm going to host it a little bit and then we're going to other people host it it has to be bigger than me to succeed and I don't want to be the k/t show we got like a really smart team of journalists and researchers and writers helping us make that show we'll never be like a regular journalist hosting it'll be probably somebody like me or a youtuber like Jake Jake we've met before Jake is our head of production it's a nice sounding title but I'm alone and I feel Head of Production alone and he's like really leading the charge on the media stuff including the Daily Show now editorial I know there's a lot of questions behind editorial editorial meaning like you know what are our political leanings and what can be the content of the show the show is not going to be a politically motivated show we're not going to be trying to convince anyone to do anything in this show politically in fact politics will make up at most a tiny tiny piece of this show and that's challenging we're fighting against the baggage that comes with CNN a lot of people like CNN for certain reason people hate CNN for certain reasons and then we have to sort of push back into my own baggage I will be voting for Hillary yes that was a little heavy-handed I realize that you know let me take a second and explain my own political position and again my politics will have a little role in this show in my hosting of it as humanly possible but it is important for me to share with you where I stand politically so well you can watch the content through that lens now besides like a lot of folks on reddit and whoever else labeling me like a snowflake a liberal snowflake Lib tard I think is the title actually I personally identify with a lot of conservative values identify with some liberal values and a lot of libertarian values I'm scattered and I certainly don't subscribe to any one political label I do subscribe to a set of morals and a set of principles and when I look to politician to a like who I don't like I typically like the ones that are rooted in principle in values more so than a political party or affiliations or things like that I know it's very heavy-handed in the last presidential campaign but look I hated the 2016 presidential campaign we had two candidates neither of which I liked one of which I dislike more than the other one that I dislike I don't love what's around in Washington that's both sides of the aisle I have huge issues with politics in the United States of America as a whole and that's where I stand politically I don't even know if that's appropriate for to be in this video but I think there's a lot of misconceptions about Who I am and where I stand politically so I wanted to share that with you themed news will not be politically focused politics are only gonna play a tiny if any role in that show itself instead it's a daily news show about the things that interests us that is the team that's making it and where we are the show now actually we are producing it we're making a show right now and we make something we look at it internally and we're like what sucks about this and we try to correct that and right now I say this show is good we want to get it to very good and when it's very good we're going to launch it publicly and then someday we want to make it great very good is good enough to put it out there and then we want to hear back from people and and ultimately together make it great and that when I think of like my blog I think the first episodes tend to suck but [Music] like look beam identity design so that's this isn't final but like that's what we're thinking for fonts and like being news beam tales being Doc's being productions like the different things that we're going to do under beam and those are like slightly different fonts this was an earlier version of the logo this logo I liked but and then we landed on this I don't think that this is finalized either but this is the idea I hope you think that's cool I'm very very excited about that design I think it feels fresh and smart and also like a little bit nostalgic like kind of weirdo 1980s local news but in all the right ways this is give me the first time anyone look how thin I am this is the first time anyone's seen any of beam news actual beam news this is just a test this is not for publishing on being music what I need to know okay when Costa spit not me the I hosted it Casey is very tan I did look at the screen we try to talk about we found this interesting story that we liked about click farms and that's basically the thing that instigates the whole entire piece is click farms how easy it is to get clicks but this is a good this is it sort of teaser to show you a little bit of like the things that we are interested by we I mean the whole team is interested in it's not politics it's not the news that your parents watch or whatever this is like but it is news news but it's more of an experience I think is what we're trying to go for hey now no ok here comes the first-ever case of a little bit of a beam news might this is something that I found to be particularly interesting happened on Monday and that is that police and Thailand raided a clique farm and we've heard about put farms before especially on platforms like YouTube but in case you haven't they are places that sell social media likes follows and views to companies or individuals who want to boost their online popularity that could farm in Thailand like other click farms in India Bangladesh and elsewhere have these janky looking racks filled with hundreds of cell phone workers then rotate hundreds of thousands of SIM cards through these phones to make a look different users were liking or viewing or friending or whatever it is that people do now let's be clear to me this is a form of cheating and a lot of platforms and online stores prohibit stuff like this in their Terms of Service and they might even kick you off their site or delete your fake followers and views and likes reviews if you do business with a click farmer other fake users but also legal the three guys who were arrested in that Thailand raid weren't arrested for running a clip farm according to the AP they were actually arrested on charges that included not paying taxes on those hundreds of cell phones and we wanted to figure out just how easy this is spoiler alert it's actually pretty easy for example there are vending machines in Russia where you can buy Instagram likes as if they were skittle so all this gave us an idea to try two things one let's actually buy some fake Instagram followers and two what if we did it for one of the people working upstairs at the beam office and then we just didn't tell them about it hey Jack so who should we buy some Instagram collars for Steve all right so it's pretty easy we found this website and we have some few options for how many followers we should get what do you think we should go with one hundred timeout I like that it's quality followers yeah the best only the best well that's for Steve all right we can do $39.99 because we have pnn money oh there's Wow yes that is we have a plane while I do this you go upstairs and see if we can capture the moment when it happening yes all right you can walk up and try and not have speed see me doing this but it's going to be kind of obvious I think what's up man yeah well you were firing partner Joey strike a pose okay there were pain now see what happened okay did we paid 300 for the camera hey Rick Rick for the kid very aware that I want to tape if you're Mike Patton in five minutes so read that as well Justin just in case picked up to 265 lead I had to like in the comments now let's just refresh this thing and see when it takes place and this works I'm going to freak out yes it's happening that's 53 lights right now 77 like 86,000 905 951 I feel really bad notification you're kind of blowing up right on IG what did you do why do I have 2000 like Sonic 3 what not somewhere in there almost 200 times more people taking my photos than regular now we're going to talk a little bit philosophically this isn't the news anymore but what I find especially from living in social media I mean my career was made off of social media is that it's an extension of our selves to a degree it's allowing us to share these moments of our lives with others and we want people to appreciate them is that in the form of a like or view probably yes and so there is some meaningfulness to that all right that is the new I'm Jake this was being new and remember to smash that like button because it's the only thing that makes me feel valuable or important in this life and hagas why follow me on Instagram Twitter Facebook snapchat I would say beam I'm head apps dead All Right see you later is it 3,000 likes now wow that's awful did you go to song or simple I'm in first I really can't deal with having to clean that up okay yeah okay are you gonna be that pilot it is possible we hope to launch that show soon ish like you know weeks maybe a month something like that like I said we're making it now this is not ready yet the second show that I'm anxious to do is an investigative reporting show like a once a week show where we like dive really deep into one issue and pull that apart and after that like I'd love to do something that sports focused maybe would live I'd love to do something that is music or fashion focus that's more cultural but that's the scope of the ambition on the media side like it's it's this is not talking head news we want to really broaden our scope in what we're doing and we want all the content to be very like YouTube centric so I hope that helps give you a better understanding of what we're doing what I've been focusing a lot of my time on and and maybe even gets you a little bit there's the Sun it's like impossible that even lighting me and I will of course say this like I think a lot of people have concerns that CNN the company might be heavy-handed in what we're doing I think a lot of people have concerns that what we're doing is going to be like crazy liberal bullshit I think people have concerns that like it's not going to be me and when I don't understand something I am immediately skeptical of it so I would expect that of you about this new thing that I haven't done a good job explaining yet but I say this whether you are suspect of CNN suspect of news or a new thing or whatever here's my ass just check it out when we launch if you think it's shit call us out and tell us why it's shit if you think it's really shit just never watch it again but if you like it like let us know let me know and let us know why and that's the that's the very best I can do if it is garbage and you don't like it totally cool unsubscribe never watch it again stop watching me but I think that we are doing something interesting and something new we got awesome people working on it and I hope that we're able to turn something out that you're pumped for okay beam coming to Oh [Music]",

            "data": "all right Sonia despite the increase in the cloud cover over the past couple of hours temperatures have remained on the warm side still in the lower 70s we had a few more than that up to 76 October 23rd 2017 and it's 76 degrees outside average weather for this the average temperature for October 23rd is 50 degrees it is 26 degrees above normal today I need an excuse to be outside for today's video [Music] all these packages right here these are mail time packages no I I genuinely thought when I announced has me selling my extra mail time stuff that people would stop sending email time stuff but more just keeps coming if you don't know what I'm talking about a few months ago I said I was gonna take all the mail time stuff that I don't personally use and sell it on eBay so far we've been able to sell almost thirty five thousand dollars worth of stuff and all that money is gonna go help the people affected by the hurricane who live in Puerto Rico we're distributing it with a couple of different nonprofits down there but good work folks but one thing that came in that really stood out that I've wanted to make a video about is this tiny electronic skateboard called quick wheel I think it's called quick wheel now if you've ever seen this channel before all rightie of my videos you know that I am the world's biggest boosted board fan I own six of these things I ride it literally every day of my entire life and this electric skateboard the boosted board has literally changed the way I interact with this entire city I don't ride a bike I don't take the subway the only way I really get around is on this thing yeah I love the board it's the greatest thing ever but I have one gigantic persistent complained about the boosted board and that is the price it is cost prohibitive for most people so addition to like me how tiny this thing is it's also need 200 bucks which matter of disclosure I wasn't hired I'm not being paid by quick wheel to review this thing initial sort of build quality on this it feels like like a regular proper skateboard see this is like it's what a regular board decks made out of wheels feel nice and gummy bearings I don't know they seem fine it looks like the motor is housed inside of the wheel here and I think there's just one motor just in this wheel alright now for the real world test I recruited my friend Sam helmet runner kids when driving electric skateboard of any kind safety matters so we're gonna go to the west side works like a safe place to tap these things what is interesting though is my ability to carry this skateboard while riding my big skateboard [Music] so just to show off the sides before we actually test this this is your regular penny board here look it it's smaller than a regular sized penny board this is your regular sized backpack almost sort of fits right in the back it spins ready silent [Music] [Music] it's much harder to balance on the Naboo support you look so goofy right it's like a toy I mean I have to say the responsiveness is pretty good like the speed top that do not have the confidence on this that you do on a boost at work already this is the breakdown 3 2 1 break there's not much for breaks alright dude do I have to [Music] [Music] baby [Music] you look great [Music] so I guess the question is is this a toy or is this like an actual means of transportation it's it's a toy I think this is a toy but airports airports travel what else is this useful for if you have a huge house a good way to get around your home yeah I mean at 200 bucks it's not a bad Toyota play with like I don't have many bad things to say about this it's really small and as someone who's been skateboarding for a while there's really not much room to put your feet so one thing that is interesting it's both the size and the Flex of the boosted board that lets you come over bumps and if you hit little potholes or cracks it can handle it so this board has neither size nor flex so when you hit a bump you really feel it most of the take offs not much alright so epic conclusion here it's a cool device I think they're only 200 bucks which is a great price but I don't think that feels safe the way that a boosted board does I think boosted's the only electric skateboard I've ever ridden that actually feels safe to ride if you're a parent thing you get it for your kids then you live on a cul-de-sac and it's a flat ground yeah maybe maybe a fun toy if you're thinking about this for any form of viable transportation even if you live on a college campus I give it a no the same it's it's dangerous it's dangerous but it is fun and 200 bucks is an insane price [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] only electric skateboard that weighs less than three kilograms you know one day I do have a quick question about when it comes to this skateboard on their IndieGoGo page it looks like like a crowdsource thing the company quick wheel it says in San Francisco but the voiceovers like this weird word is made of computerized voice and then there's like two very American looking bros who star in the video but it's filmed in China I have nothing against products made in China just if it's a Chinese company own that it's a Chinese company and don't front like it's a San Francisco startup this is a robot word why does it seem like they're posing as a Bay Area look that's China yeah yeah that's bizarre weird right [Music] [Laughter] [Music]",

cabs come back soon Dan I love you the tracker man [Music] you're part of a tracker crew yeah there's a crew of people that just drive trackers trackers and other beaters it's a beater in any youtubers youtube career and certainly a crowning achievement in my own youtube career is this this oh this the diamond play button you get these when you get 10 million subscribers YouTube gives you one for free and it's hard to describe but listen it's heavy it feels solid it says my name on the back can you see you see that this is Casey nice that congratulations on passing 10 million subscribers ah so I thought today a fun little video a fun little experiment would be to go ahead and saw this in half and see what's on the inside these are the guys these are guys okay this is Dan and this is thanking these guys have a fantastic youtube channel called what's inside where they cut things open and see what's inside how do you guys come up with the name it was my science project and we had to pick a question so we decided to do what's inside sports balls but then we just named the channel what's inside so we can have more things not just for sports yeah you wanna see it yeah have you seen it before no I'm alright it's heavy and it's like solid something so careful of it and not so we're gonna use the cuts to do do-do-do careful ok what do you do just kidding we made a fake one so you do that stun where's the real ones whatever shatter now you crowd just drop it all right what do we ready we this is metal but this thing is made out of crystal and we don't want to take the metal blade and put it on the crystal because I like my eyes my face it's what does it call it's it's led free crystal I'm sure you're good at this yeah do it will it shatter oh wait does this happen oh yeah careful of sharp on the backside a little glue let me see if I can get the metal bit off the bottom it's glued on there really well that didn't happen okay all right well now so the rest of this is completely solid so if we're gonna get into this I don't think there's gonna be diamonds but we're just yeah the logo here this one's actually mine congratulations on passing ten million subs okay I love that we're doing this do you guys know how to use a chop saw like safety we have a saying you know some people say like safety is our number one priority we're like safety is in our top five so I don't know that's a terrible idea [Music] look this is actually mine [Music] I just blew a fuse did it work [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] do you feel bad I mean this is an award your Diamond Award you feel bad about cutting it people always ask me that in the comments um do I feel bad I honestly I don't think I would have done it if we haven't told them they're not in on the secret yeah so we did a video where we went to YouTube award headquarters and while we were there they showed us tab they showed us a blemished Diamond Award so we printed on there but it was already a blemished one that they didn't order we cut my actual now this is a blemished one you sure just a little bit of blemish so where's that good one pretty sure they should we cut the right way okay you're right okay okay so look this is an actual one that we cut in half it's real just we're gonna send it to anyone so we engrave their name on the back this was like a faulty one yeah yes but this is a genuine one if you get ten million subs this is what you get that's the real one okay so Dan and Lincoln here made a fantastic video where they actually go and they visit like the factory where they make not just the diamond play buttons with the gold ones and the silver ones it's pretty fascinating seeing like the assembly line yeah I mean what other platform does something like this where they give their creators an award that cost money time they've changed them over the years to make them better are you trying to like jockey for some YouTube network isn't here that would be nice no but I'll link it below go over to their channel where they made like a longer video it really is interesting I think the most telling thing was like that shot where there's a table and there's like hundreds of gold play buttons just lined up and it's sort of the only it's the only like realization or physical thing where you get to see how many people are crossing that threshold to a million subscribers every day every day okay thank you for watching please don't cut anything in half at home we are professionals and especially don't cut and have a solid piece of wood this is space grade aluminum okay we'll see you tomorrow on the show where I cut in half my Tesla [Music]",

said just FYI there's someone outside your door he won't leave I had to call 911 one somebody showed up here they were able to get into this building this is a locked and secure building but they probably snuck in behind someone else they came to outside my office door right here what you see behind this monitor and then they just refused to leave and Dan showed up and actually kind of interacted with the guy and film the guy on a phone I'm gonna show you what it looked like but please know I'm pixelating the guy and I'm trying to alter his voice because I would assume he's doing this for attention and the last thing I want to do is give him attention but this is what it this would look like by breaking into someone's night you know welcome yeah dude I don't care you can't do this you sent me an example of what not to do I'm like nah you are no one has ever made it by breaking in a walking of nobodies in though this is a building with a closed door and a locking key and you snuck in the front door and you came up the stairs you're making yourself look really stupid in front of a bunch of professional people here that are trying to work look at me okay see you're not gonna come in if you if you look at me yet look at me you gotta go you gotta go the doors over there look at me I know you're trying to be case you talk to Casey you gotta wait downstairs like everyone else so I appreciate dan I appreciate Sam I appreciate Patrick for trying to get this guy out of here and do the right thing ultimately the police did have to come we did file a proper police report here the crime is criminal trespassing look I don't know if this guy wanted to hurt me if you wanted a selfie with me have no idea what he wanted but when he's confronted by three people who clearly know me he refused to leave showing up at my office as public as I make the address showing up here is just not appropriate one thing that happens often there makes no sense to me as a parent makes so no sense is when parents drive down here and sit here with their children to wait for me to come out of my office I love meeting people see me in the street make sure you say hi but in an environment like this is just wildly wildly inappropriate so this was a kind of a scary situation but just in general I just please be respectful of my office space in positive news though we are going to build like a retail we're gonna build like a public space in some part of 360 a space that will be open and have some sort of normal hours so if you are in New York you can come visit and that is appropriate and it's a space that I control it doesn't disturb my my neighbors this guy's this guy's not invited okay now I will start the vlog how to vote ideas you've had this was by far by far the worst idea [Music] you've got action and you've got intent without intent there can be no action but without action intent means nothing you see my biggest frustration with 368 the series this show is that I want to share with you all the intimacy's of what's going on at 368 but company 368 the factory 368 this whole thing that I'm trying to build here but it's a slow process with 35 days in there's a lot happening there's a lot of there's a lot of action happening but I only like to share with you the action because to share the intent well I don't know about you but I find it frustrating when somebody says to me I'm gonna do this or I'm gonna do that instead I prefer to back off and then bring you back in when there's some action to show you so let me share a little action with you probably the biggest thing is what's happening behind me here see we can't open up this entire space to the public because well we're trying to work in here but we want to build a space in the very front of the store want to build a space that's like you know we have hours and maybe it's open one day a week or maybe it's open two days a week then maybe it's open more than that I don't know but a space that people who come in to want to have a merch store in here we want to have like an won't have a space where you can do like installations video installations art installations who know that's happening in real time this this this is an action not intent it's not we're gonna do that we are doing that not sure what the signs for but it's just so cool we kind of had to have it this I guess is probably more like intent than action just this isn't really relevant to this this video it's awesome they're right Charlie sure what it's for but we can easily take a picture of every visitor we have in the space just to sort of track things it's a cool project this is our jump bike rack jump bikes are motorized bikes that you just sort of rent or borrow right around the city there's a lot more happening with jump bikes but I can't share it yet I'm going to save the intent but I shared the action [Music] [Music] [Music] the office the office is not as all about intent this is where action takes place every single day the planning the plotting the future 3 6 8 it all happens right here the other thing that's happening that's very exciting is the team the three 618 is being built out we currently have five people that work for three six eight and soon you'll be introduced to them right now it's so kind of well there's like there's a lot of like HR stuff there's a lot of good reasons why you haven't met them yet you'll meet them soon five people it's happening this is the location of what will be our second podcast we're trying to avoid that diner motif here because ultimately it will be a talk show that we put most likely on YouTube or somewhere else but this is that it's being built the first recording will most likely be this week so it's happening action so that's it that's the update of three six eight a lot going on right now there'll be a lot more to talk about very very soon but action the National Weather Service and not in New York has issued a severe thunderstorm warning for Manhattan in southeast New York it look like that they're supposed to huge storm today I didn't think was gonna happen oh my well we got to go to the highway it's happening there's a huge storm really [Music] guy is madness all right so I've made it out here this is where I want it to be the wind is actually not as strong out here as it was in the city where it's so pretty strong you gotta see the sky [Music] I don't know where it is I'm trying to take a picture this boat I feel like it's fine oh it's going haywire wait the shut oh [Music] it's really coming cut it down oh it's like a driving punishing ready the trainee stings and it hits you Oh thinking everyone's everyone's like running inside and you're like let's go outside coverage another boosted board [Music] fucking doing it I'm having so much fun [Music] through this booth abuse was broken better plan we are poison the city pretty a look at that [Music]",

            "data": "if this video looks and sounds different from my normal videos it's because this video this episode of tech review Tuesday was shot almost entirely on the Sony rx100 mark 6 point-and-shoot cameras see that little guy there normally I shoot on big SLR cameras like what's behind it but today I'm shooting the entire episode just on this little point shoot [Music] hmm pretty cool so I've been using this camera now for about a week and I can tell you without hesitation it is by far the best point-and-shoot video camera ever made so this video isn't about whether it's good or not this video answers or tries to answer one very simple question is it worth the absolutely insane price tag of $1,200 $1,200 for a point shoot cameras okay ah see watch me when I do those feeling fly drinking drogyn with my pot noodles smoker herbs [Music] as far as specs kill this thing is [Music] Oh [Music] Oh kids were great as far as specs go this has all the high-end specs that you would expect including 4k this entire video is in for occasion switch it over this is really really great high frame recording or slow motion ready this entire next scene right here was shot on this camera at 240 frames a second is wildly impressive stuff coming from a point ship but there's one main feature of this camera that I want to spend most of this review on and the main feature I want to focus on the main differentiator from this camera from its predecessor this is the mark 5 this is the mark 6 is this new lens on it and this lens effectively goes from like this shout which is about 24 millimeters it's a wide-angle shot to a crazy 200 millimeters ooh watch this ready still zooming which effectively gives you like a crazy telephoto lens and a wide-angle in one camera that will it's this size that fits in your pocket that's a huge deal to appreciate that is to appreciate cinematography [Music] cinematography 101 with Casey at its most basic all shots all cinematography all shots fall into one of three categories first category the close-up close-ups are great for intimacy or emphasis or you know what you know to close up this the medium a medium is this it's like this at 90% of all YouTube videos they're all shot in media then last last is the why too wide the white is the big shot that's meant to show context it shows where you are this is every shot falls into one of these three categories in any in any movie any TV show you've seen leverages some version of all three of these shots [Music] this is a huge deal or a huge deal for me for for one big reason and that's that and that's that I'm told now to achieve those three different shot categories I've had to have a camera like this with a wide-angle lens that looks like this and then if I want to get those long shots those uh those close-ups or those flat shots where the shots that show distance or perspective I had over a long lens that looks like this so I guess the $1,200 question is can this one compact camera replace these three things and that that brings me back the very question that I posed at the beginning of this video which is is this thing worth $1200 I really think in order to consider that question question you have to look at what else you can get for tall under bucks I think budgets for like a YouTube camera set up I think like what can you do for a hundred bucks for 300 bucks for 500 bucks but when you start to get into the 1012 hundred dollar range you can do and buy almost anything for example the cameras I showed you earlier this is a Canon a TD this is their kind of crappy but whatever zoom lens and then this is their super crappy plastic wide-angle lens you can get all three of these camera stuffs you can get all three of these for the same price as this point shoot camera see on Amazon you can get the ATD with these two lenses and all other crap for 85 bucks less than this point shoot these three things or you can get this point and shoot camera and I should say for emphasis that the majority of my youtube career was built with this camera and these you can do most anything with this so it's hard to imagine why you would invest your whole budget in pointe shoes instead of buying something more dynamic unless your priority is size and compact knits one thing that this camera can do that an SLR can't do [Music] [Music] last two features of this camera I need to discuss my favorite and my least favorite first my favorite you can charge this camera just like its predecessor by just plugging in a micro USB cable like this little cable here which everybody has they sell in every drugstore in America you just plug it in and it starts charging if you have one of these batteries on the road it's this is a feature that should be on every single point shoot Sony thank you for putting this here and my least favorite part of the Sony rx100 Mark 6 Sony I don't know what you were thinking there's no microphone there's no audio input on this camera so in addition to not having a place to to mount it this is what the top looks like there's no place to mount the microphone also know where to plug it in not people that have external audio on this camera will always limit its capabilities so that concludes my review of the Sony rx100 Mark 6 I hope it was helpful to answer the question that I started this out with is this camera worth $1200 to or 500 bucks less there's no question but for now it's gonna be a difficult sell incredible device really tricky price [Music]",

            "data": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] you ready are you ready to make this movie yeah I'm ready [Applause] welcome to the long-awaited Casey and Roberto's guide to running four new runners I'm Casey I'm an amateur but very passionate welcome Roberto mange an Olympic runner four oh one point seven sixty four fifty five split twenty-nine thirty five forty ten Roberto when you land in the Olympics did you metal-faced Casey yeah no it was a very competitive race as the Olympics no metal huh no but I mean those are participation medals you know everybody gets them so what we're trying to do is like answer questions for really for new runners so we asked people on Twitter to ask us questions we're gonna answer their questions and give us an informed as informed advice as we possibly can have you did you run yet today no did you bring here you bring your running bus oh yeah I sure did ah there's a trick to putting on your running clothes I bet you Roberto don't even know this trick okay ready so if you ball up your running clothes like this and then just take them and whoa does that work huh we're gonna answer your questions while we run we need the questions we're just gonna we're gonna do the questions here I think this was a good one too definitely what is your advice for absolute beginners absolute beginners I'm gonna go first I'm gonna first here's my advice of Eunice's how I started running if you've never run before focus on time and time alone so set yourself a goal like can you run for two full minutes two minutes without stopping if you can do to get to four once you get to ten minutes without stopping get to 20 until you hit an hour that took me like four months and I started running good advice spot-on just gradual start everybody starts a different place but something where to build up from yeah what are the best shoes what are you running I exclusively run a New Balance that being said there's the shoe out there for everybody no two feet are the same I run almost exclusively in Brooks I'm in Nikes today Asics are good New Balance are good and Mizuno's good they're all good it's just what works for you because every foot every foots different lucas asks okay Lucas asks how do I stop running away from my problems I'm only answering that joke question because I I literally run to get away from my problems like what I'm having a tough time running makes me happy I'm having problems at work whatever having fights with Candice but I'm just getting angry a run does cheer me up I literally run away from my problem that's why I run 70 miles a week that's a great question [Music] Maron asked what is the difference between running on trails and roads and running on a treadmill and which is better I see no reason to run inside almost ever trail running and running on concrete I personally love trail running I just love getting outside get with my thoughts feel nature and what's the difference like is it better for you um yeah I say running on trail softer surfaces it's easier on the joints so a lot of people aren't aware that I'm running on concrete all the time it tends to beat you up a little bit even if you have proper footwear that's why I'm hurt every year well he also runs a lot do you stop for water a lot Jeremy wants to know do you warm up or just go for it you warm up no I just gradually build into it I never warm up if it's a short race like a 5k I'll warm up but for my training runs like every day I never warm up I just go outside thank you maximum distance covered in one run I think the most for me if I see the 32 or 34 miles whatever you get lost no I just love distance all right for me I ran 29 miles once by accident I actually got left behind so I had to get home [Music] [Music] [Music] there's one from gand I think it probably a lot of people struggle with but how do you get out there on days when you're not feeling motivated good question remember - what got you want there in the first place what your goals are there's gonna be good days and bad days motivation for me is just like running makes me so happy if I don't run a miserable and that's kind of that's kind of all I need okay ash Ashley wants to know I used to run a lot and I've fallen out of it any tips for getting back into running can't stop one stop a break here and there it's okay but you're gonna make the biggest gains by being consistent in your training so again just try to get out there neither avoid it neither of us had an answer for that question I'm not seeing this question here but I want to know from you mm-hmm for my own well-being do you stretch if I'm gonna stretch it's gonna be after the run when your muscles are more warmed up before nope definitely not before unless he do a slight warmup run so never stretch cold don't stretch cold can lead to injury goodbye all right last last question I don't think anybody asked it but I'm gonna ask it why do you run Roberto great question I like I personally run because is my journey of self-discovery I want to find out just how good can I be hit what are my limitations and running is so pure there's no red there's no coach you know so pure yeah you just go out there and you run and you just find out how good can I be that's why I run sweetie [Music] all right so that that concludes kind of our first aren't your leg was touching my leg that's alright we'll roll with it it's just weird when it's like two grown men it's a lot of leg action it's a running movie that's our first running movie I can foresee a lot of people saying but what but I want to know a lot of unanswered questions but Roberto keeps saying like this should be a series and I think he's right so I hope this was helpful yeah we look forward to hearing from you guys I just got to run enjoy the day yeah if you're thinking about running just just run just run keep it simple like we do [Music]",

lightning doesn't strike twice this is what I've been talking about no god this is honestly one of the worst parts in the game this was the first time that I saw the monster for the first time when I played it so you can I think I played it for like four hours or something that I had to meet four or five hours to get to this part right Thank You mr. chair and I had just been so diligent to make sure I don't run into him so I had so much fear of the unknown just built up and then what happened was I went in here I think no it was one of these similar rooms and I I don't know if I wore my headphones the wrong way or what happened but I heard him and I went inside the room backwards I'm explaining this very poorly but it's oh it's a worse scare of my life I'm not kidding like I've never been so scared my life it's like I think the monsters over there I open the door then I hear a noise the monsters in the room but I'm like oh shit he's over there so I go in like this we'll get to that reaction later but oh my god that were scared by life I don't think I've ever been that scared and I'm walking in circles now I'm sorry I got a little sidetracked fucking some dark I can't lift

evening and the outrider who has been with the coaches it's Bremen advised me to wait until morning before I venture further I've arranged for a bed a dare moolah the village is only in my love the names they came out went on to write I tried to sleep but as I close my eyes I see the man who fell victim in London my fear and shame forces me to witness the same scenes over and over they are dead

chilling in the kitchen so I forgot how you open there's no Momentis well that's not good that means we're clearly missing something so this way was the kitchen and down there it's a secret entrance so there must be something over here yeah there the receptacle um let's go let's go get it let's go get this bread that's fine you need help is that bread bread is that you right stay right there bread all right let's go to a receptive column I'm coming for you buddy receptive Callum everybody yeah this is debate I'll never forget this bit ever Jesus because you go in here and you read this stupid no worries now great Brandenburg is a majestic creation perched upon a forest clad Hill with towers reaching well above even the highest pine trees following the winding road leading to the gates it's the impression of discovering something forgotten as if journeying with Marco Polo to the Hidden Xanadu Xanadu zonda the Baron is a peculiar but gracious man and he once stood well versed in worldly matters and is not at all as eccentric as I assumed my room is exquisite and I'm confident that no hotel for miles could even hope to match it Wow as the Sun sets on brennenburg its fairytale varnish turns to an eerie gloom Alexander's strange servants are never far away they are a quiet lot and their behavior could only be described as skulking Alexander seems pleased by my presence as he puts it it seems like I got here just in time interesting I forgot about this so now if you touch that stupid door how's my son doing there'll be enough time bro be cool we'll play this game anymore oh my god oh my god oh my holy fuck fellas jesus fucking christ oh my god oh my fucking god oh Jesus Jesus oh my holy oh this game is gonna give me a heart attack that was the most horrible thing ever holy fuck I can't do this anymore he will be in there yeah sorry bro I'm not going so we'll be ready it's fine Oh God I got that I'm so scared now look I lost my sanity I don't know if it uncovers actually I need to drink a lot and then okay so we got one of these this is so annoying I don't know why they added this because it just makes you like sick yeah it's almost like I need to die on purpose to get this away it's really it's stupid how do you do that that's probably one of the biggest flaws of the game as I would say excellent condition Oh all right yeah he broke down the door what an asshole and there's not nothing even in here that's the best part oh I had lighten him okay perfect should be a little better now yeah there you got look oh of course of course I don't even have to cook anything I remember now leave me alone I'm making cake bread cake again Jesus Christ it's my brain did we cook it or it's his acid go to all acid we should just drink it honestly that's what I would have done it's been like all right it's been real but bright ain't worth it no no you cannot roll me like that you cannot throw me like that okay surely now he's gone shut up shut up I don't care I don't care I don't care I don't care whatever virgins idiots but donk a donk badonkadonk oh yeah Demond in times right there okay so kitchen now we'll go to the recipe no that's right I'm bringing carpet with me just in case thank you for being with me bitch no one really picks up at carpet these days okay that's cool I know you like bread okay I know you're his favorite but I think we could have some good times you never had a good time with a carpet before kind of plucking all my view sorry there you go very nice why it's okay it's okay just put me down and I'll protect you there you go that's right that's perfect like they like that I'm not supposed to be here shit just close the door Felix hurry okay so ridiculous I freaking told you Felix thank you carpet so much people don't appreciate carpet these days okay so now you add the acid it would be no good what are you kidding me are you kidding me which door is it then I don't know could it be could it be oh yeah because he Brooks hmm ah this must be it yeah yeah yeah oh yeah oh yeah smashed I'm great Oh oh fuck you dude get the hell out of here oh yeah oh god carpet carpet okay carpet I'm leaving your bag orbit the carpet not Garber hey hey it was like a father to me I loved him like a child Hey look we're here now hustle time so you use the drain sewers as a means possible yes an underground spring greased quite spacious it seemed only natural to incorporate it into the overall structure but we won't not today the flow is seasonal and when the spring test-drive the dad tunnels produce a rather poisonous type of course we're almost there this is a really cool area I forgot about this they really they really did a good job designing puzzles I don't know it's cool oh god it's a water monster here oh god it's too deep all right so we need to drain it duh okay well it's pretty impressive for a castle to have this so I I don't know I thought I remember that you had to like throw something at the ladder maybe I'm wrong a greased because this is in the way hmm I don't know I honestly oh here we go convenient glass jar that we can use to grease let's Greed's it up baby that's my catchphrase in life huh now it's dammit god dammit we were so close the broken pipe is blocking whoever it's someone damaged so now you throw that's why yeah we do it again of course hope smash yeah alright the lighter is me and the pipe is t-series watch this guys take this got him got him that's what you get tea Suey's yeah that's everyday you climb ladders in this game surprisingly in the wonder where I should go all right oh I feel tall so now of course what we do is we we hit this one and then we hit that one and that lowers what is his message all right and then whoa threes oh god don't do that note to self we enter the Syst Sister Sister Sister that's right Oh in this area as well this game has so many Oh God exactly what is he up to I don't remember coming for Alexandra you put patata yeah that's a word okay I really like to wait my lantern guys I don't know a faint mer break it straight alarm hello are you in there empty chamber well he can't can't be empty then can it I think this is another one of those where you have oh no what was that oh jeez that's Christ what's wrong with me okay I think we're fine actually oh thank god look we're fine thought I was a gunner just get up just just get up just get up Felix there you go good job buddy it's a lot a skillful jumping in this game you have to be really good at jumping just like I am extremely described I'm not surprised even while traveling across Europe I assumed I would have to embrace the supernatural to save my mind and life as a novice I do everything in my power to stay focused and not dwell too much on my own doubts Alexander woke me up early who told me it was time we got started on our work he was obviously excited Ashley headed downstairs to the old dungeon where he preferred to attempt his rituals his sex dungeon you know in that's only by DaVinci I'm sure he showed me several rooms fitted a specific research such as Anatomy study dead dogs and botany the crown of brennenburg must be the inner sanctum a most hallowed ground where we shall attempt to permanently banish the orbs shadow alright let's spin oh yeah I don't think that's good just a guess I don't think I did anything good there but you never know you got to remain optimistic oh god oh god I'm sorry buddy I'm sorry man you know I didn't Oh geesh hey I hope t-series is in there hey listen are you okay just tell me hello okay that's good all right well these things happen you know you live some you lose some that's what I always say so where do I go from here there's no way they're not having the water monitor in here I do not believe it well we got a little with that ladder how do we do that then how am I supposed to do this throw my hammer throw it nope don't work didn't think it would oh maybe I can just maybe throw on their throne things usually works in this game IQ 5 million I bet you were like a rabbit didn't work oh really oh really didn't it I didn't do it I did it I mean I mean I okay alright look at this dude look at this using my orb Alexander managed to channel its power on to us I feel like the orb is is another word for sex and he makes this game scarier it was like standing in a mad world pool of impressions it was terrifying but Alex are the kept calm just change orab with venus tools of science in order to tame the storm the blue light was stained by strains of red and the walls burst with pulsating tissue resonating with the scene okay Ambrose that covered the orb in some cloth and the unspeakable things the shadow is closer than he said I should prepare for a warding ritual tomorrow now I can't I can't stop imagining it and yeah damn it alright let's spend time spend time spend time yeah we did okay it's this where the monster comes I don't remember okay come on don't frickin mess up now feeler okay so I think I think that was both of them shut up shut your mouth boy oh it's over there as well god dammit how did we get there I think we have to throw a rock or something no was that not him huh alright well let's just go then Hey look there's a fish that's happening okay so now we just gotta I'd spend time spend time oh yeah hey trying to fake me out boy okay he's definitely in there it is still early and Alexander is busy preparing for the ritual later today seeing him this worked up makes me question why what does he stand to gain I realized he is curious about it all but sure there must be more this is fate foolish he will attempt to tame them the power I admit that yesterday when Alexander flooded the inner sanctum with blue light I realized we had but graced the orbs this might turn out to be more than a shadow it might be the beginning oh my god I can't unsee it now stop stop okay Oh spend time whoo five burger baby oh yeah that was epic thank you thank you thank you thank you tango tango tango oh god oh god oh shoot so I think we're done here they should have designed this puzzle differently so that when you were done with it you had to like go through with them on sir that would have been cooler just in my opinion I don't all right so we are back here that's cool now I think what we can do is we can use these right now wait we'd already done those well then I Oh could it be that we drained the pipe so we can go down there now well we shall see hope tea service doesn't scratch my thing okay here we go what if I just greased myself up you know oh ah and then when the monster hits me you won't be able to grab me see ah Jesus oh yes a fungus thing is that gonna kill me nah it's fine oh god I'm gonna die I'm gonna die I need a vaccine oh okay find a vaccine are you really asking for a lot here aren't you I don't remember that we never went in the control room did we oh my god oh my god this part this fricking part come on all right like this deep flavors an old friend back it out to you however it seems gray and was I talking about come on move there you go muscle salt I spent so much time in hearing doing this puzzle I remember I did a full episode just me like going back and forth and everyone was just losing their mind I think there's a right order to do this for it to go all the way down like oh my god that was easy I hope they did not take me long and then we put the winning crank somewhere I don't remember where you don't need to wait say oh yeah there's a missing pipe here that needs to be changed that you need to find somewhere see I'm good all right don't worry this is the pasta solving skills can I just do this all right let's not we got a new pipe hey piers I think I could read the next character in your aneasha series all right sure you got the part oh god oh god oh no oh thank god I have to hammer you out did I find the pipe too early do I need to stop the flow first maybe the work I have put into the news machine is unequaled by the reasoning of any man the thought that generation of men have passed away since I first attempted to reconstruct the design is most tiring this is a great but the limitation of this world have made my work incredibly difficult it has forced me to build a thing almost a hundred times larger than the delicate contraption it tries to emulate not to mention the flow of tame lightning crudely replaced by pressured steam pushing it its way through the pipes and turbines it shames me to think that of what the interior would have a thought of my monster inventor I'm stupid where he works with a magnifying glass to carefully fix all the part I push five men to erect up a tower abroad in ayran in the hope it will have even the tiniest hint of power found in a traveler's login okay so I think what we need to do so to add it's stuck why geesh okay there's something here another pipe might be useful later and we have these things maybe a clue right now there's no clues great it's fine why what is that effect what does this do goddamnit I take it all back I'm a fucking idiot his must have done something was this here before maybe needs to be balanced so maybe one of them is stuck maybe this one is stuck oh there you go so I need to balance it out okay so one of them is just the height of that pipe and okay well no wonder this took me forever Jesus Christ oh it's the pipes over here there you go okay I got it okay guys this is epic okay so the last one goes I guess you just put them randomly I don't I don't know it's all about balance I guess the puzzles did I put them their own order I don't know possibly yeah look oh yeah they come off okay I see look I did it guys there must be one more pipe then I'm missing a pipe must be hiding somewhere where are you pipe there you go okay now I think the only thing is to match yeah yeah you know what are you doing so I think I heard a sound before oh my god I was so close are you kidding me alright so what does this mean then alright well I did something so let's go out and check it out oh and now the second one comes down dammit you'll need a push like why all right net maybe now oh of course of course oh yeah all right oh yeah oh there this is gonna be freakin awesome let's go brow alright we did it on that note I'm gonna end that episode there hope you guys enjoy this episode if you did any support is appreciated like smash subscribe and all that stuff and I'll see you guys the next one",

the city [Music] all right kind of an amazing and super positive change of plans dan and I found bicycles Chicago is one of my favorite cities because it has yeah okay you need to look up what the blue mind theory is as such being surrounded by a large space of water actually brings your levels of anxiety down that's why I search when we're standing at the sea taking it in quietly it takes away our stress it's one of the reasons why we love the ocean so much do you feel happier since we got to the lake so much happy okay very exciting because we're here in Chicago and I don't really have anything to do it seemed like today would be a great day for the first ever 3 6 8 Q&amp;A joining me today is Dan hey look forward to yoga oh I'm looking for I'm looking forward to questions also we didn't shoot a proper Q&amp;A intro for 316 yeah boo did shoot this little nugget [Music] so those of you new around here I usually ask via Twitter you can follow me on twitter my link is a great question from Jason Caron öthey what do you in Canada is planning on starting the podcast I would say realistically the podcast will be started within the next two weeks and the podcast will have a video component in addition to like the regular podcast which we would download and listen to his audio weird a video too so what is done actually do out there what what is Dan actually do aside sleep Dan's just like my homie from South Africa whenever I'm in Cape Town visiting we make movies together he told me he was coming to visit New York City and I was like I'm starting this series just being a homey that's what Dan does how many people do you plan on employing at 3 6 8 large ask that question Lars I plan on employing as few of people as possible to make that place run like a well-oiled machine when you have too many people your responsibilities become management instead of action and I hate managing people okay this one is dear to my heart will Joe be joining you in New York City Joe is Dan's dog let's cuts a photo of him so you can yes this is how many's Christmas Jes I guess I mean half horse case you don't fish yes I would love to have your puppy in the office I just don't know how to get a dog here from he's an old man okay there's been a lot of questions about me sleeping continuously in the vlog or looking like I'm half asleep hey that's just me but also a fool sleeps when he's tired and a wise man sleeps when he can and I think that yeah 3 6 8 we pushing so hard every single day every single second that I have the chance to sleep even if it's on the side of the pavement I take that opportunity will Candice make more appearances on three six eight yes what the is that hair and all caps Sami I'm with you this is just a terrible haircut I had here the blonde and this is my only option where do you see this in one year this is in three six eight my goal for 316 is to have this be a 500 episode series which means one year from now I'll still be doing this what are what are your plans for YouTube damn I think that I'm I'm super lucky to have Casey as as a homie and I'm here kind of learning from him which has been a crazy experience and what I'm gonna do with all that knowledge within the next month I'm gonna start weekly uploading on my channel will 3 6 8 be entirely edited by Casey or will other creators upload their content the mission is about a space and is about collaboration but 3 6 8 the series this series this is my series so you know I love collaborating with people like Dan and in the future there'll be other collaborations but 3 6 8 the series will always be will always be my series ok last question here's a good one from Zack Bennett how do you all foresee the content in 3 6 8 different from that of the original vlogs Zack I think it's very similar to the original vlogs but the ambition is very different I want to tell a much bigger story than just my story with 3 6 8 it's just going to take time 3 6 8 the the vision the company that everything right now is nothing but an empty space as my ideas start to become reality I think you'll see this Daily Show going directions that take it that take it away from what people came to understand as the vlog [Music] Navy Pier I have no idea what that means [Music] there's one more question that came in that kind of broke my heart and I want to address it goes like this it's from smoking Joe how would I be as good as you when my life isn't very interesting and I can't afford decent recording editing equipment I can't seem to gain any growth after two years of hard work hard work and patience are really what's required to find success in any field in life two years is a very small amount of time and you gotta be prepared to commit everything if you want to stick it out do we have to get out I had such a good answer to me creativity is the ability to be able to believe in the way in which you see the world so much that you actually create an art format and from what I understand like video is an is an outlet it's a voice poems aren't outlets music may be an outlet it's it's a personal perception of the world and the creation around that that becomes interesting and I think that like you've just got to keep at it there's so many different ways of finding execution and people that will find your work and platforms but if you just keep and stay true to yourself and the way in which you see things and that's your what your videos are about that's interesting that you need that's bloody beautiful [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] damn what did you think of your tour of Chicago Chicago's rad that you are possibly the worst to a guy [Music] on tomorrow's episode of three six eight hey I want to come I want to come pick up the bikes today can I do that I rode my bicycle fast Oh window last night i roller-skated to your door at daylight okay you guys what did you do you",

            "data": "[Music] [Applause] technically I'm still on leave because I had a baby but I came into the office today for like a couple of meetings he had a couple quick things done and I I'm just trying to make a video so I thought I'd do like a super quick tech review Tuesday now I I didn't have time today to work with them to make an intro so Dan's intro will come next week but it does seem like it's time to review the Elan musk flamethrower [Music] I really appreciate how well designed how thoughtful this 2d drawing schematic is here we're in company not a flamethrower what's in the box nozzle logo Nisshin propane tank fuel bracket I don't know regulator trigger goal duress ergonomic palm placement alright this is clever you're not supporting customer the lawyers have spoken and due to shipping restrictions we can't mail you your glorious propane tank bummer to make it up we've included some cold hard cash so you can scroll down to your local store and pick up some nice c3h three pretty thoughtful alright so here it is now Elon Musk referred to this in the Joe Rogan podcast he said that it wasn't actually a plane for all they did to build this was take a it's actually just a roofing torch with an air rifle cover [Music] a roofing torch and if you look closely you can see that it is simply a roofing torch you've got the you've got the igniter right here and then this is the nozzle here that the flame ostensibly comes out of there's what looks like copper or zinc plated steel piping in there back here you've got a propane adapter all this stuff here is just plastic and you can tell that this used to be I think a paintball gun or soft air gun because because where this Allen head is right here you can see there's like three one two three little spots there safety semi automatic fully automatics you have to assume that's for a paintball gun so this is it look this is the this is the soft air gun the plastic soft air gun that was used as the housing for the novel flame even here on the side where it says the boring company that's just like a plastic little plate that yeah adhesive this just glued on there so basically you you pay 500 dollars forward is effectively a 30 40 dollar roofing torch with a bunch of plastic on it that's okay I believe in Elon Musk and I like to support his endeavors let's get some propane [Music] [Music] y'all so propane moving gasps yeah thank you 10:34 Ilan you owe me five dollars and 34 cents now the thing about New York City is I just can't walk around in the street with anything that resembles a gun at all so with the flamethrower review in New York City a very very good rule if you care about well surviving or your life you never go outside with anything that even resembles a gun squirt guns pellet guns anything like ice keep them in your house so a gigantic functioning not a flamethrower flamethrower is something you don't want to bring outside because you wouldn't want something like that misinterpreted by law enforcement they might respond well in any event and then even ironically that what I feel is the safest way to test this flamethrowers by I was by using it indoors flamethrower that getting like at least my opinion on sort of the thoughts behind the flamethrower well the flame I wouldn't but we didn't put a lot of time into the flamethrower this was an off-the-cuff thing the whole thing is just a joke like in the movie space balls there's this scene where they talk about space balls merchandise what is this place what is it that you do here merchandising baseball's the lunchbox thanks balls the breakfast cereal thanks [Music] you know for me personally like don't have any need for this stupid thing no but I do believe that the boring company is gonna be a company that does like really world-changing things in the future just like Tesla has and SpaceX have and to own a souvenir like the minute I finish this video I'm putting in a box and putting it away but the owner souvenir just feels like an awesome thing to do also I love a good joke and this thing's a joke that's a terrible idea terrible sin by one I took I said don't buy this flamethrower don't buy it a California Assemblyman said that he intends to introduce legislation that would prevent the sale of the sought-after flamethrower Miguel Santiago Democrat from Los Angeles is leading the charge against flamethrower sale Santiago said in a statement I honestly thought it was a joke when the article was read to me the state of California in the city of Los Angeles having trusted mr. musk to help alleviate a real public policy problem here by executing a tunnel under the city to help alleviate traffic this this deviation come on this deviation feels like a complete slap in the face dear Assemblyman Santiago lighten up [Music] this propane tank holder by the way is a mountain bike cup holder here did you hear that yeah there's gas coming out got two fire extinguishers I've got this large fire extinguisher here which will be strategically placed here I'm going to go ahead and preemptively get the hose ready and pull the firing pin I'm also gonna be placing this secondary fire extinguisher right here maybe not so much in my frame but right right here pose also at the ready okay these ceilings are 14 feet so there's enough space for the flames [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oops okay I didn't turn this off and it is worth noting to everyone at home that the just rode microphone windscreens are indeed flammable so maybe maybe take the windscreen off before",

            "data": "I don't care what you say if you're in New York City you gotta buy chicken guys [Music] today let's talk about my today let's talk about my new cellphone I got the note e now the only review anybody's really interested in when it comes to the note e is the note 8 versus the iPhone 8 which I happen to have right here I'm just kidding this is because the new iPhones not out yet and that's really all I care about is this versus the new iPhone I'm not gonna do a comprehensive review instead think of this is like a first look and then I want to tell you why I like phones and computers with stylus is stylized stylus and as always in the name of transparency please know that this review is extremely biased while I was not hired or paid by Samsung to make this video i have worked with samsung in the past I work with Samsung in the future so this is a biased video [Music] sighs now the note 8 is objectively a gigantic gigantic phone it's the biggest phone that I could find in my arsenal it's huge in a kind of direct side-by-side comparison it's a little bit bigger than the s8 plus it's a lot bigger than the s8 regular it's a lot bigger than an iPhone 7 I don't have an iPhone 7 plus but that's like you know that's like this big good like swallow an iPhone 5 it's big but I wouldn't say it feels too big in the hand in fact it feels really good in the hand and my jeans which fit pretty tight so slides in there nicely you know it's a big phone but compared to like what we have in our pockets anyway but the feel the feel is really good it has like a heavy density to it a robustness to with it it feels good what I do want to talk about is the idea of a big-screen phone with a stylus for me that's the magic recipe I don't know why I think it's probably like the tactile nature being able to actually use my hand to draw something if you notice I've been doing some of my vlog credits in my own handwriting I've been doing that on my iPad using procreate it's amazing quick aside Apple there's nowhere to put this $100 pen you can sort of put it there but like where is it now it's gone I don't understand that I've had to buy three of these things so far Samsung gives you this little sleeve which isn't so pretty but it's functional and then on the surface I got this really confident inspiring magnets things not going anywhere but Apple where am I supposed to put this thing I think a big part of it is that I've got really fat fingers look at the size of my fingers they're like hot dogs and that's not a big deal what I'm trying to touch use the touchscreen on a smaller phone like this like look how much of my fingers are too fat if you're inarticulate non-specific like I disagree with Steve Jobs on this one who wants a stylus you have to get them and put them away and you'll lose him yuck nobody wants a stylus but the stylus whether it's on an iPad or a tablet or on a phone it enables like another level of interaction I wish that this laptop had a touchscreen because and that Final Cut Pro was optimized for like stylus because if I could interact with my media when editing video like this instead of down here with this I feel like to be much more effective [Music] well don't turn don't turn you give me a ride Chris nice to meet you Chris it's more than just the stylist I like the stylist the stylist is important when you combine the stylist with having something that fits in your hand like a notebook but it's more than just a detail think of it typing for example or data entry on a phone without a stylus without a stylus this is how you type with a stylus this is how you type and to me that's a more elegant or organic way of interacting with something it's exactly how I write if I had a notebook and a pen and then if you take that idea and you don't just look at typing but you sort of look at tip photo editing for example there's this because precise and it's almost like using a mouse and a cursor and then this we're like fat fingers get in the way of whatever I'm trying to do this thing that seems done so it's actually integrated across the software here which makes it is that I should caveat that by saying I still haven't really used this thing but the note 7 when they recall that was my favorite phone ever I do I do thank you very much Donna thank you see what I want when I walk from a phone it's perfect more like a computer remember the palm treo that phone had a keyboard and a stylus that felt like a little computer I mean nothing stuck compared to today's phone standards but the way you interacted with it was more computer-like than this go into our Santa Monica see you can get worked on these things just by using your thumb and hammering away but in a pinch it does act like a computer you can actually get work done so that's it my thesis is more based on like the note as a phone less than this specific once I've actually played with this much yet but I hope it makes sense and it is like my my favorite phone I'm happy to have it back maxie you see it do we have the same shirt on [Music]",

things in my office I could show you something else all right one of the benefits of having and whatever a five-year long relationship with Samsung is that they occasionally send me their new gear before it comes out this is not a sponsored video or anything today is Wednesday I don't know what the date is but they haven't even announced the note 9 yet I've got two of them thank you Samsung I will do the notes my favorite phone bTW I will do a proper review of this thing as soon as they say this is I'm allowed to or whatever or I have a chance to play with it but mostly I just wanted to come on here and mostly blue most I just wanted to show you that I got it I was told not to leave the office with it look very exciting you can count on me to do a full slightly biased review of this thing as soon as I've had a chance to really play with it they announced it today so I just don't even know what's new and what's different with it but so Janice and I have been doing our marriage counseling and going to a therapist to always improve our marriage and make sure you know we're being the best spouses we can be and as the husband of a to a pregnant wife one thing I'm trying to be better as being more empathetic so she just texted me asking for chicken tacos and I'm being good husband I'm going to get her chicken tacos in the middle of the day on earth out of one says that's what you do nothing oh how are you to have an order of chicken tacos please three thank you all right so this place here it looks like it's like really old but it's not I remember vividly the first day they opened and it looks so pristine like see how it's all dumped looking right now I remember seeing the owner his name is Serge he was outside hey guys he was outside with a mop and a bucket and the bucket was filled up with dirty water and he was painting the outside of his sign trying to make it look like it was like a New York institution when reality he had just built it but now it's a decade later and this place has become a New York institution does it look like it's always been here [Music] your chicken tacos milady so I do they give you the right thing I got them for you look I got you walk them only and chips too you're a star am i doing a good job of being more empathetic [Music] can you move my bracelet from disarm yeah to this side you can do it here yeah okay so step

[Applause] you barely fit in this elevator you do look great third what are you doing honey just because you don't know how to drive it doesn't mean it's a stupid car what I was sitting there and I didn't even recognize the key was in the car it's a key not in car maybe it just doesn't maybe just doesn't agree with you cuz it never does that for me so I have to design in the Tesla I was gonna do like a whole review is this gonna spoil my review no but there's there's one thing I really do like okay the fact that it's the greatest car ever meant one thing when you when you push the brake and the door closes for you that's actually quite handy okay okay these sideview mirrors they're so tiny it's like what is the point of them I can't see anything you just love to complain don't you and I think you'll agree with me on this you will no car is perfect this grid leg pattern here when you're driving in the sunlight yeah flecks on to the windscreen when I let the windscreen look at this it's all black okay I'll tell you what happens when I Drive West at the end of the day the Sun shines out and it's coming right here this is all glass and the sun is shining into my eyes yeah that

in total sincerity you're way nicer on set than I am yeah I didn't hear what I say that I go to the bathroom really number 11 ask for forgiveness not permission shooting in the sub-basement [Music] the kinds of ads that I was doing I wasn't happy making right so what do you want to be when you grow up what's the big goal I want to be uh so my major goal is to be made my major goal is to be paid to make the films that I want to make I mean doesn't that sound like the dream number 17 don't be fearful of rejection we're now headed out to the water to shoot what will be my final scene ready [Music] dan is on the boosted board taking me go Oh number 19 day one is the point of no return I mean doesn't it sound like the dream so what's between you and accomplishing that just fucking doing it the location dad asked me for it was a place where we could sit on a bench with good light no one would bother us in the city skyline would be behind us this is what I came up with skylines right there no one's out here look at all these vacant benches beautiful benches beautiful location I think he's going to be very happy with this every time what do you think what do you think this location that's good number 18 develop your own voice are you excited dad I'm sorry to be put can I get emotional a little bit of okay do it cue romantic music done dude -

not done mmm a little bit of this okay bitch yeah okay I just want to say before I see it that I thought your intro to yesterday's tech Tuesday was filmmaking perfection linked below if you haven't seen it so I was reading some YouTube comments and I read poeple that really hurt my feelings and I wanted to address them the gist of these negative comments were like what happened to three six eight I knew it was bullsh this is just a regular vlog why don't you talk about three six eight anymore three six eight is a fraud you don't know anything about business look it hurts my feelings because it's wrong and I took all this time in a previous episode to explain as clearly as I could to these haters that less sharing intention more sharing action I said this yet these people these haters these mega Megatron's are bringing me down and it made me think of one of my favorite fake Chinese proverbs which is people who say it can't be done should not interrupt those who are doing it I'm doing it stop interrupting me with your negative YouTube comments that are hurting my feelings so this update is for those haters those doubters let me show you a little bit of what 3 6 8 has been up [Music] you see once the Death Star is fully up once three six eight is fully operational then almost every episode the narrative of every episode will be about three six eight doesn't mean what I'm making progress a lot of progress remember how it used to be one gigantic huge open space well now we put it in a wall to see this wall this makes this fun fun space break its own little space and what we're gonna do with this like separate room we're gonna make this room a retail space like a space that's open to the public it's not open to the public yet but it will be open to the public construction team this space will be open to the public this would be a retail store this will be an art installation space for the first first exhibition we're gonna do we're putting a tattoo artist in here and in the window you can come and watch him do tattoos closes it opens up the front space to the back space it's not something that we need or are interested also maybe hard to tell on camera but it's all a beautiful shade of white back here because we painted the entire space you might notice it's a little bit darker in here than it used to be that's because we tore out all of the track lighting so you could be tracked lights that run the entire length of this space we tore them all out we're gonna redo all the lighting that's happening that's happening now that's what this is all about and you see the investments in new hardware here we've got 265 inch cubes and then right here we have the granddaddy the biggest Hewett on the market eighty eight incher we're not a hundred percent sure where these monitors are gonna be used but I think the eighty eight incher is gonna be for our new gaming setup this is this is excited the three six eight kitchen the kitchen this is where we can have our dinners this is where we cannot creators who do like cooking channels and stuff like that coming prepare a meal for people it's being built out right now this is the countertop bar area they'll be a sink here there's gonna be a stove here a refrigerator here and then look look at this right here we already put in water we had to put water in here we had a pipe plumbing pipe with the this is water we had to put this in you know complicated that is and probably most importantly the three six eight team is being built out can't introduce them yet because there's an HR process that we have to work through but you'll know I'm soon enough sorry guys it's okay you see three six eight the idea the business it's all predicated on first having the perfect space and lower Manhattan for creators until we have that we can't really kick things off and that's what we've been focused on it's been just under two months we've made significant progress and well we're almost there that over there that's Queens that over there that's that's Manhattan I'm headed to Queens it's a lovely place I don't know if I've actually ever been there in the blog before lovely place and now I'm in Queens not entirely sure where to where to go right on Jackson Avenue left on 21st Street see as much as I love this city I seldom leave like a 10 to 15 block radius around worthy offices so this is a part of the world called Long Island City it's called Long Island City but it's it's actually Queens it's still very much so New York City but short of running the New York City Marathon which comes through here I don't think I've ever been to Long Island City before it's awesome out here alright I'm back in Manhattan let me explain what happened I was all the way out in Long Island City because my dear friend Gary Vaynerchuk who's also one my favorite people on planet Earth asked me to do something with his his company out there and of course like any excuse to work with Gary his team was amazing and they gave me directions but then I was like I was like Dorothy seeing the Emerald City for the first time Long Island City was awesome and I was like checking the place out and I was wandering around and then before I know it I got super lost and then I was trying to call his people and then my phone died and what Google Maps it would be a 20-minute trip ended up being an hour and 45 minutes and well now I gotta be home to relieve the babysitter in ten so Gary I'm sorry Gary's team a friendly sorry for just totally screwing the pooch on this one I hope hope you're not mad at me [Music] all right we are out here outside of Shake Shack it's like 10 of midnight Dan when you said later today I didn't know this is what you meant buddy I got I got a baby at home I

a few weeks ago ICM Business Insider that Emirates has this new plane with an even sweeter first class I want to fly in that plane now look there is a good argument that just because I made a video once and just because I harassed them on Twitter I'm not entitled to a free airplane ticket I agree I happen to be going back to Dubai for work this week so like all the moons kind of aligned I got in touch they got in touch with me via Twitter and they're like yeah we can make it happen so I will be flying on that ridiculous new first-class cabin very very soon there's another tiny caveat here which is that that plane doesn't actually fly from New York to Dubai so I'm gonna go all the way out of our way to go to Brussels on my way to Dubai just so I can fly this new airplane just so I can make a video about it this is very exciting for me [Music] [Music] [Music] y'all black suitcases look exactly the same you gotta do something to differentiate excuse this non-sequitur but before I embark on my voyage I want to talk about YouTube for a minute the question I had asked more than anything else about YouTube is how do I make a successful YouTube channel there is a very simple a very simple answer to that do something nobody else is doing and do it really well but that's a hard answer to hear because even though that's simple in concept and execution that is maybe the hardest thing there is to do and it's for that reason that I appreciate creators like like david dobrik who introduced like an entirely new genre to the the comedy space on youtube or like my friend peter McKinnon who introduced like a different production style to vlogging every once in a while there's a unicorn that is someone I see on YouTube who just like blows my mind a creator doing something that is so new so fresh that like it makes me question my own creativity because it's not just a new take on an existing genre it's not just doing the same thing other people are doing but better it's it's completely new from every perspective so this is me talking about my new favorite youtuber her name's Ellie the mill as an amber channel but she is someone who I think is pushing the boundaries of YouTube creating content that's just brilliant like really not just complicated but very well done productions but like really intimate and intricate and brilliant narratives and subject matter including like some of our more silly videos that are just sort of like jokes or pranks the complexity and depth with which she approaches even that kind of content is something that there is like not a lot of on this platform now when I try to think of what it is that makes a creator like Elle so special it really begins with the way she's able to authentically be herself on camera I feel like the person I see on screen is the person that I might know in real life that's the kind of thing that seems really really easy there are very very few youtubers who can do that well including me I struggle being on camera the person that the person that I am in real life being yourself well hard is one of the things that you can do on YouTube to really differentiate your content from other people's people don't always copy your style or your look but they can never copy you being yourself sounds like it's an obvious thing to do on the platform but it's not and it's hard you see other people other creators that are successful you want to emulate them and you end up you end up putting on a facade of who you are end up thank you you end up coming across as disingenuous something you're not so now if you see this video keep up the great work you everyone a collab let me know I just fly up to Canada and hang out with you or maybe you want to come to New York City we could do something interesting together big fan here [Music]",

getting ready to push off now it saves me a long day of location scouting this is like honestly what is that day I mean they say it's a mass but it looks more like that so we're right here this is Mexico yeah this interest is all women the road now I can remember were and this was the road like the Halloween Havoc up turn hours really this is so now we're on the dirt road the next stop is the Mexican border of the Rio Grande but what we're doing here today is we're doing more location scouting for Max's movie max made do what you can with me earlier this year now I'm helping him with his doing you can't movie it sort of begins with a crazy idea where we need a long stretch of road and today's location scouting is to find that perfect long stretch of road I don't think that's [Music] I know this topic about but furthering reconnaissance here let's go find it okay I must be really rusty am i drowning or something so I can't find new york city anymore i haven't been in the blogs much I've crashed it three times today and I just crashed into a telephone wire any sign of it village it's gotta be around here in this rock formation I think is what we do there's got to be there what that means boom boom it's right there you buy that I mean seems fine just broke its leg this broke off aggressively I guarantee you this thing still works should not explain the whole idea for Max's movie the requires shooting out of the window of a cause it's moving at a certain speed to capture you guys going to test it with the stabilizer here they come is there using the stabilizer to see if they can get a stable shot of the window of this car traveling at that speed I mean that's where it in the animation is playing in here right that's pretty smooth it's pretty smooth yeah you can't tell that especially if that's not like that's not the best stabilizer either right if this is not the best one it's not that we're getting Travis okay this room is not going to work it's now long enough stretch and it's not too bumpy you gotta slow down a little big question uh-huh gas station about three hours away I give this road like a be mine okay and what do you what's acceptable B plus a month we call all-weather markup syrup yet I have to join from hell touch him right by the neck bite the head off so what's up a fake oh my god Karen open this idea that may be closer to the border there'll be a more like open road that's more interesting looking so we're headed to the border of Texas and Mexico [Music] so not a hundred percent as to where we are but we're definitely right at or right near the border Mexico Texas we're not going to Mexico a guy we just met at a bar the most remote bar in all of Texas according to him is taking us 200 feet this way to the Mexican American border there's no law enforcement here keith is the only law enforcement is that water escort cartel but he says that would no sense of irony before such spasm the river is over there behind that tree so where's Mexico that's Mexico sit the tree with limbs off of it let's make showing this out of the Texas Mexico Texas Mexico Mexico call text browsing its mobile plan are we in Mexico look like going to use it's on candy that better right there yeah bring the tech waited every day morning fun where's the warning sign right here now you do have to say that it says warning allele the care farm in New Mexico oh wait we can't but we can't do think oh dude I already got a references turn out yet remember football you let you far turn around pull why did you take us all the way down here can we turn around here it's a double yellow I'm a tall up there we're here because you can't go any further south and the Continental why Mexico why is that important why is that relevant here move it the whole idea is that the road we're going to pick a road that's going to tell us a story and the only way we can see that story is by traveling around is traveling on that road and the story that that road is going to tell us is about where it is in the world and this this road that's right here basically on the us-mexico border has a lot of stories to tell good bad drugs immigration buffalo soldiers Pancho via there's I mean pick your poison there are a million things that happen on these roads right here in this part of America and like I think they have something to tell [Music] back there like Border Patrol's here we go next why are you filming um I got a guy got to get this at all cost I'll pass where you'll like me I'm not insured miss party is Daniel his lights aren't on yet back off take the blade prong angled over I have no I had no idea pass out though for stopping speed sir something off brown yeah hi guys super friendly police officer here give us a warning but there's one small problem with the insurance the rental we should be fine [Music] we're back at the house right now and today's pre-production when I think very well we've got like a pretty tight Tamela what we're doing here Dylan helping us writing this is Max Vidya Max's video and I'm this kind of like this is a big movie where max can have done in two months the goal is to make it like Max's do what you can't story like his story just really is just really cool yeah I don't know I don't want to say too much I just want like I think it's really cool yeah it's super ambitious it's

stripping gum and it drives the pants pretty quickly fell then one spot for too long my pants will literally catch on fire [Music] [Applause] now I'd like to have just a little bit of a heart-to-heart with you if that's up oh what's up I was just about to have like a heart-to-heart no you saved yeah you look good dad it's easy to like brush off bad YouTube comments like people make fun of you people tell you your videos suck people say unsub because I didn't get all that stuff it just rolls off your shoulder when you've made a bunch of videos and have been seeing it for years there's only one kind of comment that penetrates that like and those are the comments that confirm your worst suspicions those are the ones that like that actually speak the truth so I bring this up now because I'm always seeing a couple of comments that are like three six eight is bullsh I thought it was gonna be this big thing you're still just making regular videos and sometimes you hang out in there that hurts it really hurts because it's not the truth but it's also kind of how I feel like I when I first announced three six eight it was this huge initiative and I've done really nothing as far as you know the reality of it is that building a business is a really slow really painful process and we are working full full full steam ahead and we're doing incredible initiatives we have like a youtuber incubator program we're gonna bring together small youtubers it's very exciting we have like businesses built into it that our early generating revenue we have the three six eight gaming which is happening and then the biggest speed bump at all is this the space 368 at its core as I pitched it all revolves around the nucleus which is this physical space in downtown Manhattan the space still isn't done and we're doing everything we're throwing money at it we've spent just maybe even over a hundred thousand dollars working on that space like we're investing heavily in that space it's just not there yet we're almost there like look this is what the space looks like today today is July what's the date day this is my live feed from three six eight look it that's literally what it looks like right now like this is the current level of construction in the front space this morning it's it's can I get an amen amen it looks but it is exciting what's going on down there I do want to take you down now give you an update at 3 6 8 will you want to come yeah man let's go check it out you curious I'm a cop right yeah yeah it is hot I think you're gonna if you say it's hot I believe you alright let's go let's go [Music] it's good it's hotdogs sorry guys we're building good stuff so this wow I haven't seen the lighting yet so this space out here is gonna be the retail space like this room is open to the public this here is gonna be the sales desk see how it's uncomfortably high mm-hmm we want it to be really unwelcoming basically like yeah we want people to come up and kind of have the desk come to their chin and then they feel awkward and small yeah just be like intimidation yeah we don't want people to hang out in here so we thought we'd make it as unfriendly as possible but that's that this is the creator space back here and this whole space is meant to be modular or really a halfpipe here when my friends come around town they're like how do I get around New York City and now I can just be like here follow my super 73 as we got 10 of them you have one of these right [Applause] peekaboo mechanically much [Music] that whole thing moves again because you just explained the whole business model four three six eight in the most poetic okay okay okay go so it's it's the Medici family of Florence so they basically made their money in banking and I've been studying them for about ten years trying to figure out how to build the creative model because this is a family who had Galileo and and Michelangelo and some of the greatest artists of all time don't worry don't worry guys I'm dropping gems over here don't worry the the three six eight is very similar to that idea in the structure and so if you're talking about moving to Los Angeles I want us to figure out how we can do something together because I've been trying to build this forever three six eight west coast but I think right but Moore's more what's really exciting is that if we get this right the next Michael it the next Michelangelo YouTube exactly how do we end this how do we end this segment you're not man sometimes you just allow things to gently go their own way you know you don't want to say goodbye you don't you don't want to say so long you just want to like is this just what you do when you don't have an ending for something yeah well he's good he's good he's good you know what this social media thing doesn't work out you should be an actor [Music] 2006 the year that Will Smith's The Pursuit of Happyness came out you want something go get it period maybe my favorite Will Smith movie ever so this is a story that I told will today but when I first moved to New York City I lived in an SRO like a single room occupancy it was a place had no bathroom and no kitchen was a shared bathroom not a great place to live and I used to ride my bike almost every day like from where I worked all the way downtown all the way up to with this huge heavy bag with like all my camera gear in it and then this camera gear was like this burden it was like this weight I knew that that burden on my back was going to be what set me free like what all my dreams could come true if I just believed in this thing Chris Gardner was doing his best but his fast wasn't enough in that movie invest all this money into these like heavy bone-density scanner things and his whole savior like the only way he's gonna be able to make it alive is if he sells these stupid heavy things and he's lugging them around everywhere and like I remember seeing that movie I was like a couple years later and I sort of found my footing and just like bawling my eyes out for that entire movie because I saw so much of myself in that main character as this struggling single father who who knew that he could find his way and and achieve what he wanted to achieve in life for himself and his family and and I and meeting will today like brought that full circle anyway a great movie you should see it if you've never seen it great day today okay really truly awesome to have you by well I'm in three six eight with my man Casey in the building so three six eight as an artist Haven is that how you describe it this is well he's our new spokesperson yes new spoiler checks in the mail yes sir [Music]",

viral video have to do with headphones absolutely nothing [Music] so after months of planning days of shooting many hours of editing today the day that we release it they say we click like make public what's up buddy you look tired tired dude how do you think the video came out Oh dark in here you got this view behind you in the windows closed yes it's so night okay I haven't seen the actual movie you know I haven't seen the cut yet this is me seeing it for the first time right now well we're gonna watch it but I promise Carmela's you already watch it okay well you sit down Casey I watch this okay this is me seeing it for the first time [Music] good what you just died the famous Carmela would you think you did a great job as Princess Leia Jessie you make a great Luke yeah an ugly one use that it's up and I'm going to bed yeah it doesn't look very loud okay so the videos were just sent alive that's the most satisfying thing because when you click the publish button it means it's done just to define what viral is viral for me help me with this definition Jessie it's when it does like significantly more views than what a typical video does right if like a news Twitter shares it and there's on the news and then it's then it's like on the trend the page and then it's on Reddit and then it's like everywhere Google doesn't put me on the training page anymore Jessie all right go to bed bro I love y'all nice Portuguese who did it later so what'd you really think this video [Music] there's this guy his name's Peter and he made like what I would describe is maybe the greatest Casey Neistat vlog troll ever he made an entire movie which is just him making fun of me but it's really good listen to when I run right now I'm listening to my inner voice telling me to stop with any kind of physical activity oh I'll link it below but it's it's pretty good he did a pretty great job making fun of me in any event this guy's from I believe Eastern Europe I think Czech Republic and ah well he's actually he's outside my studio right now I guess he came here all the way from Eastern Europe to do some something with me which I don't recommend doing if you're thinking of traveling to New York to see me don't do that I have a family and stuff and I'm not but I have a minute right now and he did make this in a fun of me out of boosted board he made this very thorough movie making fun of me and I feel like the least I could do is go hang out with the guy [Music] are you cold I'm very cold but that's the sacrifice do you need a sweatshirt no no no I'm good I'll get him I'm gonna put you in my vlog okay perfect we're trying to look we kind of look alike you know what exactly are we doing here we're doing the impossible day off Casey nice step to the parody that you shared because so what does that entail I don't entirely understand what we're doing but he's so excited see this I'm right over here there's not very good lighting outside my office it's a little bit here see it's like a dark yellow a shadowy this fine okay what do I do now did I do it good its attention to detail you know how to make the magic happen here okay ready this didn't make sense at all what are you talking about so now we shoot it in here well then we have a little change of plans this is going to take like 15 minutes if it's old you are using up way this is I got to pick the baby up um I'm gonna do it really fast okay go yes sorry I just gotta get the babysitter I got I love drunks I just love flying drums since I was no come on I always like meeting new creators those two were a couple of real goofs I know I said today's episode was two segments and that was technically a third segment but I hope you can understand that I didn't hit segments coming otherwise I would have included that in my introductory statement to this video now it's time for part two which is also part three headphones I shot this next part like a week ago but I want to have some test time so it would make sense hello this will be a comprehensive review of these new Bose sound support free headphones that when it comes to headphones for me I kind of have like two schools of headphones and one are the headphones that I edit with my go-to there are the Bose quiet like the bose noise-canceling bluetooth ones they're great literally zero complaints here and then the second camp are the headphones that are run with and that's what that's what these are for first a few words on my edit headphones I can't run in these because the way that them the way that the ear cup fits here it fills up with sweat gets disgusting after like two weeks ahead phone's start to smell like a foot and then you put them on your head and your head smells like a foot it's just they're not good for running I have tried Apple's ear pods I like them but my main phone is a note 8 I don't need to run with my iPhones it's not water resistant so and honestly the thing about the ear pods is they don't like block out enough of the surrounding sound I'm hoping for a winner here okay now for the unboxing [Music] okay here they are this is like the recharging case it's a little it's bigger than the these things are a little fatter than I expected I don't know if you can see how big they are do they look super weird but feel like there's a big thing sticking out of my ear alright comprehensive test nine quarter miles it's like a little over an hour and three minutes of non-stop running I gotta say these are very impressive they haven't been bouncing I haven't had to adjust them or like they haven't they haven't budged the sound quality is excellent I think the only beep is that they don't close out the noise around me so even if I have them on full volume I can still hear this music playing from the mini golf course right behind me and I love sugarpie honeybunch but when I'm listening to Wu Tang I wish you did a better job of blocking out the noise otherwise maybe the best running headphones never used all right so it has been a week since I got these these headphones and first thing to address is the price these are $250 which is insane for a pair of headphones that are these are ones these are the Apple ones the ear pods these are 160 what like home these are called air pods these cost a hundred almost $100 less than these cost this sound in these have you ever listened to these you're a big ear pod guy right tell me the comparison I use air pots every single how you even put these in you hear anything you should know too that Sam is the biggest an Apple fanboy on planet Earth anywhere is this stupid at your pods every day but for the base with the base ready really base heavy yeah I can't barely hear myself talk this is weird they're like really good for sound yeah these are impressive these are really impressive Incred incredible okay thank you that was a unexpected supportive Sam's just in this video colonias earpods now for the not so good I don't know if I mention this but this is not a paid video this is like a not sponsored I bought these off Amazon I had two hundred and fifty dollars well everything needs to be perfect so first thing first they're huge they have to fit in this case here see this case very good case the case recharges them five times or something like that but in my pants okay ready that is like are those headphones in your pockets are you happy to see me that's a lot - that's a lot right there especially when you compare - this is a little bit too much always fit in your pocket like a cell phone then the last thing and I don't mean to sound like a snob with this but when you wear headphones all day it becomes fashion right Sam that's right now I think that these look really really stupid in your ears they're white they kind of drool out it looks like you have like just kind of gross the way these look in your ear do you like the way these look these look I think these look stupid but despite them looking stupid there's no denying that they have a look right it's like this is very Apple industrial design they fit in here perfectly when you see people you know what they are the way these fit in your ears quote my wife Candace I will not hang around with you as long as those things are sticking out of your ears they are enormous no like I need like this is like a this is like a maybe a medical device somebody said to me it looks like I've got two babies pacifiers in my ears now I have to say I'm the biggest Bose fan I love your products I don't mean to just be making fun of you like this but this is legitimately how I feel when I wear your headphones so this is an actual baby's pacifier and this is your $250 wireless headphone head headphone piece they aren't they in my pocket all day every day solution like I than to be and like so many people use the air pods for these always with you always I want that but I also want better sound quality and I also wanted to work with my s8 that's it for KC's tech review today please tune in next know what I'm gonna do these it's been about four hours since we released the video I can't quite tell like how the views are going sits on Jesse's channel and not mine [Music] yo did did this video go viral or what [Music] so we can call it viral all right Jesse call a viral it's like the morning after I filled in that last bit and I'm not gonna run this one keeps getting disconnected which is super fun knowing tellus my music it's like coming in now this is my Fagin hate blue to it man it's gonna be cable he's want to run out here it's like this is so frustrating I just want to hear my music when I'm running and it's freezing cold outside I don't want to be messing with these I just want to run this left one here kept getting disconnected from the right one music coming here and not here and this is a software issue Bose I hope you can fix this but in the meantime in the meantime I have to amend my review from a cautious thumbs up to a more neutral like mmm I hope they can improve them in the future until then I don't know that I'll be running with these or using these because like I can't I can't add a stab giving it go thank you Sam you gonna plug my channel for this this is a good trade-off don't forget to go to Sam's channel and like and subscribe the YouTube addresses wwe.com for",

24 to 48 millimeter optical zoom lens okay now for the [Music] all right so before we get into the flight test of these drones I just want to talk about how I actually judge drones drone quality etc so you've got two axes you've got the quality how good is the picture that it yields anywhere from okay to top-notch versus the price expensive less desirable cheap everybody wants cheap this is the sweet spot here you want a cheap but top-quality drone so you start with something like this spark here the spark is the spark is 399 dollars which is very cheap but the quality the quality is just about okay so the spark I put right about there then there's the folding maverick air and the Medicare is improved quality slightly more expensive I've put it right about there the original Mavic it has absolutely stellar quality and it's not that expensive at 999 I put it right about there this thing at best quality for consumer marketing drones that DJI sells quality is all the way over here but they start at $1500 and they go up from there depending hours control are you getting all that chest so they're more like here now testing the maverick to zoom and then a b-2 pro the price puts them well the price puts them right in the middle here and the quality is to be determined but obviously I'd love to see it right right around here so we're heading to a prime drone flying area where there's lots of things to look at and we can fly there legally Justin why can we fly in Coney Island legally 20 islands outside commercial airspace Class B so it's just outside of JFK's like no-fly zone or whatever just another reminder to always respect the rules of the Federal Aviation Administration right yeah you got it that's exactly right so we are here at New York City's Coney Island seem like the prime location to test [Music] [Music] my first time flying the zoom having a zoom lens especially one in the air lets you do things that otherwise would be impossible with the drones one of the cool things though is it's letting me do it live so like or automatically so I go 48 millimeter I swipe up to 24 and it automatically zooms out or in so the implementation it's very good I mean very good for a beginner for sure it's more expensive it does have guys Hasselblad one inch sensor on that that means like a bigger better camera that should yield better dynamic range better colors better low-light better kind of everything [Music] that is the regular Mavic in Mavic one we're gonna fly all of DJ's legacy drones now to compare the image quality between the old drones and these and these two new drones [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] yeah [Music] [Music] [Music] have you been out here yet I had a hot dog yeah you told me that we were gonna eat hot dogs now no hot dogs no hot dogs we gotta go back hot dog is not sitting well at all ah as someone who's super fluent with consumer and prosumer level drones having looked at the footage that these things yield I am not surprisingly but I am extraordinary impressed with what they're capable of the pro in particular has amazing dynamic range in just this camera that they've managed to put on here is just an extremely impressive camera and that's how's the chicken game away from the nomadic zoom if I had to guess I would say the zoom yields a very similar image to the Mavic one but that zoom feature is extraordinary and personally I think that this zoom is going to be my new go to number one drone this this will be the drone that lives in my camera bag this will be the drone that I travel with this will be my new drone so what that means for my my chart here I take the Maverick to pro at fourteen hundred and forty nine dollars and I put it I put it right about here the quality is top-notch the price is still a little bit expensive but the Mavic to zoom that zoom feature the quality is top and the price considering what it does the closest drone to the sweet spot of any drone I've ever used and I would say that DJI with these two latest releases once again shows that when it's time to buy a drone it's not do you buy DJI drone it's just which DJI drone Dubai [Music] if I am gonna complain about one thing though it says the old nav Achaemenid that never really stayed on there well and it's kinda well I'm kind of unhappy to report that they haven't done much better with the Maverick - it has this and I can't figure out how to [Music]",

right here and he killed eight people and injured others to make sure no one would ever be able to drive a car down the bike path again the city of New York and the NYPD but these concrete barriers all along the bike path make sure no car could fit in thank you to the NYPD thank you to the city of New York for taking these measures to keep us safe I as a cyclist and someone who uses this path appreciate it very much but and it's been nearly a year since these blocks here were put into place and while they are effective in preventing cars from driving through here they do make it dangerous for cyclists and runners and people walking on this path to trying to get in and around this used to all be open for traffic to your both ways but now you see there's a small opening here a slightly larger when they're a tiny one there that she's coming through and then two smaller ones here in this particular case that the things blocking the road take up about 90% of the of the path itself and here this corner here is just a confusing mess if someone's coming around the corner on foot and then you got a biker or a runner coming this way well it's just begging begging for an accident [Music] these things for example seems like they could stop a car and they still enable fights to kind of move around and they seem like a really good kind of permanent solution or [Music] these things you're also great look no cars again through this and you can still get your body curved skateboard or whatever get around them really easily so maybe you can put something that looks like this in place of these terrible things so in conclusion I appreciate you I appreciate all the efforts made to keep us safe in the city but maybe we could maybe get rid of these things and put in a put in something that's a little bit safer and a little bit more permanent of a solution I can't begin to tell you how many times I've nearly injured myself on these and I can't imagine I'm alone thank you [Music] exit flags not that kind of flexing I do want to do a little flexing though because there's something that I've been waiting for all summer long I'm really excited about it and I want to share it with you and it's a little bragged it's like a but I'm just mostly excited to share it okay I primarily edit and work off of my macbook pro this thing it doesn't okay job I mean I complain about on the locks there's a lot of stuff they don't like but it does a pretty good job but I have been wanting to experiment with two things number one a Windows machine into using Adobe software I want to kind

radio podcast yeah okay a couple of things number one we haven't done a podcast in a while and there's a reason for that if you listen to the podcast you know that the podcast is really like real like we don't mess around we don't pull punches it's just it's honest and it's real and we've been dealing with some lately and that we hadn't resolved and I just wasn't comfortable doing the podcast until we had resolved that stuff so we could be honest and not fake it on the pod so I just wanted to explain it to you so I don't want you think it was a matter of me or us being lazy it wasn't that at all there was more to than that and this will happen again in the future when we miss uploads yes my dear we can't plan our arguments around a podcasting schedule yeah if we're like dealing with we're like struggling in our marriage and relationship we can't just turn that off to come record a podcast I hope you understand this is just us being honest alright so that's it this podcast is live though you should go download it the link is below and one thing that's interesting is we saw our numbers like our downloads and how many people are listening to this podcast it's insane millions and millions I had no idea so thank you to everyone for the constant support of the podcast Candice thanks you too come on say something hello my baby hello my darling hello my ragtime gal Thank You

the one thing that can stop t-series book review you noticed how as soon as I stopped doing book reviews sorry about that by the way T's series two sways out of nowhere and took over but no I realize now in the eleventh hour what I must do I must review books again that's whatever one wants that's what will stop T series it's never been so clear to me I can't believe I realized it just now book time the first book well I read a lot of books but I wanted to select the ones that I really really loved there's three of them but I want to talk about and hopefully you'll check them out as well the first one is the Master and Margarita written by Nick Nicola Mikhail Bulgakov it was written during the Soviet Union regime and during that time I didn't know this but atheism was sort of forced upon the population it was forced in schools and people were generally harassed into becoming atheists so this novel is sort of an answer to that a lot of Russian books I've read so far our features themes around Christianity but I think it's safe to say I never read a book like this it's a black satire it's a black satire comedy around Christianity it's very weird but I really loved it ironically mikail the author burned the first version of this book because he thought he would never make it as a writer writing a story like this during this time and he wasn't wrong because when he actually finished it 10 years later he died shortly after so it's nothing funny about that and he wasn't published until 26 years after that so it took a while but it was recognized as a masterpiece and it really is the story follows a mysterious character who visits a group of writers sitting in a park during an autumn afternoon and this mysterious character is a professor in black magic these group of writers are obviously curious who he is and they suspicious that he might be a spy and he gets mistaken for one this mysterious character is the devil reincarnated and named in the in the book Vohland all the writers are atheists and Bolin describes the second setting of the story which in Jerusalem during the Pontius Pilate trials everyone knows about this the the trial is about the execution of Jesus the writers almost say it's possible that it's never happened it's possible that Jesus never existed and boland sort of smugly describes his event as if he was actually there which is obviously impossible bolon also predicts that one of the writers head will come off in an accident and this of course gets brushed off but later becomes true and get witnessed by one of the other writers Yvonne Yvonne goes absolutely crazy trying to pursue boland trying to capture him in absolute madness absurdity and comedy I love reading this part it gets even better from there The Devil's midnight ball is wasn't one of my favorite parts of anything I read in a while it's it's just fantastic so I will just end it there but Micaela the author of The Master and Margarita he used to be a playwright so it makes the writing very visual I can really see all the characters and mannerism and the humor in front of me it really feels like you were there when you read it and which really works well for the comedy as well I laughed a lot of times reading this book and all this has really put together in a masterful story it's a story that blends history with the author's own stories that he he lived through and his own strides it's a perfect balance I think of good and evil and I really really loved it it was actually recommended by one of you guys so I read one of the comments saying in another book review saying oh I think you're really gonna love this book and you were right so thank you very much the master margarita five out of five thank you for suggesting an actual good book the next book I want to talk about it as Japanese death poems and haiku what is it called it's a really long title Japanese deaf poems written by Zen monks and haiku poets on the verge of death that may sound very depressing to read but for me I thought it was very uplifting I'm very fascinated by the Eastern view or the eastern Asian view of death as a Swedish person it's almost a taboo subject it's something that I grew up you don't really talk about and I think that's probably for a lot of people who has least watches this video which I think makes it just even lonelier and scarier to think of that I don't think it's a healthy approach and the Japanese view is more of a it's something death is something that's part of life one of my favorite quotes from a book another great book I read actually I recommend in the region would by Murakami death is not the opposite of life but an innate part of it by living our lives we nurture death anyhow this view of death is deeply rooted in Japan and Japanese culture through death poems or just say as their call that sounds funny and its origin comes from Zen Buddhism and the first documented Zhu se is from Prince Tatsu in 1686 but just like still occurring today I find out about deaf poems from one of my favorite writers Yukio Mishima and I was just so fascinated by the fact that that's an actual thing a small night storm blows saying falling is the essence of a flower preceding those who hesitate to put it simply it's a poem written at the time that but sometimes they're written even before sort of as you write a will for example haiku is a form of poetry you're probably already familiar with it follows the five seven five syllable count vashu world famous Japanese poet who defined this style of writing where you count the syllables of the poem his deaf poems reads as falling ill on a journey my dreams go wandering over withered fields haiku is often focus on the transient of things thus often reflects on nature bringing in the sadness of leaves falling from the cherry blossom because they don't last very long for example here's one written by Beynon now spring has come into my world farewell so the book starts off with Zen Buddhism which it's actually my favorite part of the book I didn't think I would enjoy it I kind of wanted to just jump to the Hyksos but it just features incredible stories of Zen Buddhists or masters that died sitting upright and right after they finished their last brush strokes of their poem I don't know if that's true or not but it just sounds it sounds badass and I like the idea that there's actual records of this badass Munk movie cliche that you see it actually has some merit to it the book features around 300 haikus some are funny some are sad some are strange I'll read some more examples I wish to die in spring beneath the cherry blossoms while the springtime moon is full written by Saigon here's another one I liked death poems are merit delusion death is death this one's written by by psyche the journey west a way that all would travel flower-filled west is said to be where the paradise is in I don't know when they believe in their dying with the regret is seen as a bad thing to carry when you're passing over to to the paradise this poem is a perfect example of a haiku because it brings in something personal mixed with nature another one for example I long for people then again I load them end of autumn it's almost comical isn't it how can we fit nature in there and a bottom but I really do love haiku I think it's a it's a perfect way to really describe an emotion I'd really like the idea of bringing something over bringing structure to something abstract of a mixing left and right brain mixing art with logic for example having the the set of rules of how a poem should be and now I think that's what really makes them good as well so I wrote a poem myself heritage if you want him autumn moon shines bright a lonely red leaves falls down your mom gave no I'm just kidding okay at ending road ahead I should travel back home soon forever sunset the way the Japanese language works it's obviously different because the syllables are are much more defined as were the letters are cold goal Wow gosh she and someone and so forth so it doesn't really work the same way in English and there's all kinds of techniques that also doesn't really translate so it's never gonna be you can try and translate haikus to English but it's never gonna be the same thing obviously but I recommend writing a haiku it's it's actually really easy it's actually really fun all you need to know is that it's five syllables first line seven syllables live em in line and then five syllables afterwards and it's usually something personal mixed with nature and a passing moment described so why don't you try it I wouldn't give this book higher than a four star rating it is quite dense in the beginning it felt like I didn't need to it also had a strange structure to it which was kind of annoying when reading it other than that it's a great book it features a lot of haikus that's never been translated before so I really really loved it and I remember commended to you even as much as any other book I talked about today next but dumb Keshawn yeah that's right you never heard about this one everyone knows about donkey Shawn but the nobleman who read too many night stories and decided to go on a knight's errand hey even though that doesn't exist anymore everyone knows about the story of donkey shot who mixed up the windmills with Dragons and fought them anyway but I think most of all everyone knows danke Shon for its humor and for how silly it is and and what a loveable character is but and yes it is it is very humorous but after reading it I realized that it's so much more than just that and I'm so glad I read it it's my favorite piece of classical literature that I have ever read it was written in 1600 by Cervantes I don't know I probably pronounced that wrong and it's been described as the best literary work ever written I've also seen is described as unreadable there's a lot of different versions of donkey shot to make it more normal I don't know I read I remember I read donkey shot before but a stripped down version of it but nothing really could read the original the book is written in a way where donkey shot seems like he's an actual person that exists in the world a terrible example would be kind of like found horror movie clips to make it seem real this is lost archives to make it seem like oh yeah this is this is a real story that actually took place in donkey shot is a real person in the second half of the second part of the book Cervantes is even himself mentioned in the story because of course the first book has already come out and donkey shot is now famous and donkey shot reacts to other people reacting to donkey shot which is hilarious as well so it's it's really funny and bizarre thing but anyway the story also of course follows not just donkey shot but he's famous and loyal squire sancho panza who joins donkey shot in the promise of becoming a governor one day Sancho had great relief to donkey Shawn because he sort of questions his ideas and his sanity and all these random insane inter fair interactions that donkey shot goes through when in his pursuit of knights-errant virtue and all that because donkey shot believes everything he's reading in books so he treats the whole world as if that's the case and anything that sort of challenges that idea and goes against that idea he blames on one way or another it could be that oh it's a wizard sage cast a spell on me so I'm under under illusions and that's why that's why I see it for no one else does what makes this funny or I think at least what makes this work is that donkey shot is actually completely reasonable as a person the way he justifies all these things happening and the way he justifies his action is completely reasonable you realize he's not an idiot he's not a pool and he can suede Sancho Panza to to follow him and do what he wants him to do and he believes it himself 100% as well that's the thing but of course other people don't believe donkey shot and whatever ideas he has and he becomes a mockery Oh for them as well the fact that donkey shot wholeheartedly believe is it it makes it really sad it's a really sad story in a lot of ways I think a lot of people can probably relate to as at least when you were younger wanting to do something noble wanting to do something greater but as you grow older you you sort of give up on that idea I mean everyone does obviously but not donkey shot and this story tells tells of that tale and you can really only love him for him donkey shot and Sancho Panza really are legendary characters I I miss them it's really weird to say that it's such a long book but it's the it's the longest book I've read but it's also the longest book I've ever enjoyed and honestly I can't wait to reread it I could go on more but there's really no point it is it is quite hard at some points and I would lie every lying say if I thought it was like the easiest read I ever had but it's 100% worth it so check it out if you're interesting check out all these books donkey shot five out of five beautiful I'm so glad I read it now for next book review I wanted to mention a book that you guys can read and we can discuss it in next book next month if I do a book review when I do a book review it will be the woman in the dunes by a Cobra Abin I don't know if that's how it's pronounced kebab has been described as the Casca of Japan it's a pretty short story so holy shit I forgot to mention the book it has some very strong sexual parts in it I guess this is a trigger warning I probably should have realized before I recommended this but anyone can pick this up and read it in I don't know a week or two and it's a concept that I think it's a interesting to discuss so if you're looking for something to read check that out and I'll talk about it in the next month as always if you have recommendations for me I always find that interesting I've also created a subreddit where you guys can discuss as well and interact and I will take part from that and reviews and ideas in the next book review so hopefully we can have a more of a dialogue going because I felt like that was what was missing I felt a bit discouraged doing book reviews because it felt like no one is actually cared or or interacted with it or read the books but I'm told now that a lot of people actually did which i think is really cool I feel so will fault myself because I think in this pursuit with t-series I've been to focus on the numbers and just pushing that narrative which has been fun but I also kind of miss just doing whatever I feel like or whatever I actually have a more personal interest in so anyway that's it that's it for book review I hope you guys enjoyed I know these are very long and very different but I hope it's fun anyway see you guys tomorrow good bye",

oh yeah this is one of Chantell stickers we were given the opportunity because of Samsung you know part of their like creator creator initiative is enabling us to make movies and they were willing to sort of produce a case you nice that movie about Chantal Martin and I'm gonna premiere that movie I'm wondering where I should drop it let me finish let's finish okay let's finish an and it'll play cool I'm reviving my old youtube channel that I started probably 10 11 12 years ago right at the beginning and I forgot I had it actually one thing that I will say about Chantal is she is fearless about trying new things it's like I see everything is a blank canvas so you shouldn't be afraid of it you should flip that switch and then just use it as a challenge and create whatever you want how did you meet Kendrick Lamar still in Miami last year how did you meet Puff Daddy he came to the show I had a few years ago he probably doesn't remember okay so without further ado I'm good this is the world YouTube premiere of a Chantel by KC video it's like three minutes long but I'm really excited you're the first people to see this ever ready 3 2 1 so what's the point in making our the point is to make so you can share so you may concern your making sure you make your share I'm Chantal Martin and I draw I'm drawing on canvases I'm drawing on walls I'm going on cars and drawing on shirts and drawing on shoes 99% of that is done live when you're drawing live you have no time to think you have no time to hesitate you have no time to plan you have no time to be anyone else so this is the cover of the home and garden section and it's it's funny I didn't know it was a big deal at the time so I only bought one copy so you have an extra spare copy out there I take it I remember my art teacher telling me Chantal don't apply for art school because you're not good enough and you won't get in at that point people were only telling me what I couldn't do so I ran away I started my career in Japan in a culture that was craft based in a culture where people learn things and practice things over generations over long periods of time and I remember thinking to myself what can I master in my lifetime what could I become a family confident with what about a lie you know I draw I love drawing we all drop though with these these I'm gonna draw like this what kind of hard work and patience would it take so that when I draw a line is recognizably mine moving to york was very humbling because if no one knows who you are they don't care who you are and everyone is an artist and you start to lose your you start to lose your way and so I decided well I'm not gonna not make up because you won't show it I'm gonna draw maybe the well my canvas and I'm gonna lose any drawing tool that I can get my hand I'm gonna draw and villager on just give me a pen and I'll make something [Applause] we follow the pen and we're allowed to allow it to go wherever it needs to go wherever it wants to take you you are a William passenger [Music] and now you repeat that and you repeat that and you repeat that you repeat that but over time you get to extract what you look like over time you get to extract what your line feels like something that is recognizably yours we have this contact between our head and our pan it doesn't matter what industry you're in it comes down to drawing it comes down to that initial mark that you make and without this pen I wouldn't have traveled I wouldn't have collaborated this tool has allowed me to discover who I am [Music] did you like our movie we're good we worked really hard on that I hope you enjoyed it what are you most nervous about when it comes to being a youtuber I think what I'm most nervous about is continuously making and sharing and pulling out stuff that I'm proud of and putting out stuff that you're proud of to you make in your share and you make you gotta making sure making sure making sure making sure all right I'm gonna link Chantal shadow before below check it out she's new there's not a lot of stuff up there yet but it's happening I'm a big supporter and a huge huge fan and I hope you guys will but you should sell those stickers you could bank all your entire you sticker packs coming soon coming soon [Music]",

in the summertime in New York City and I I think of it all year long and I do it every sunny warm day in the city in the summer and it's stupid but it's this it's not running you already know how happy running mix let's eat five miles from from my house and where I start there are these rocks and I get to these rocks and it's hot it's like scalding hot like a hot to the touch hot but I just lay here and I just cook and I close my eyes but I just kind of like meditate and think and focus for like 20 minutes maybe it's the heat or the Sun I don't know what it is but this is a kind of focus I can never find in life and then when I get so hot I can't take it anymore run five miles home and then I start my day but I start my day feeling like fresher and newer than I've done anything else I love it I have a cut I have a joke okay go you want to hear the guy who curse I did you hear about the guy who got his left side shot off his list no I didn't hear about the guy got his left side shut up oh it's fine he's alright now they save it that's gonna break that thank you I'll see you later all right it's tech review Tuesday and I have an idea wait I've got a question my intro a secret no question mmm in the video that you posted the other day you were like really like sad and upset you were like crying mmm this is me and me being honest but I didn't understand why you were so upset was it really about one video or is there something deeper that you need to talk about I don't know if I'm going through a downer either I'm up oh I'm down this note like there's no middle ground that's just me I'm like one of those deeper dudes you know wait are you down right now no I'm up I think are you bummed out we like talk if you know we're not to make videos no Bria I like to make videos okay so here's my idea since today's tech review Tuesday Dan I was thinking instead of like just reviewing a piece of hardware I have an idea every great TV show uses the same intro to every episode like so I want to have a more consistent intro for this show that's going to be the new three six eight intro and I'm going to show you how I do it what equipment I use and that's gonna be tech Tuesday what do you think oh I think it's good all right so what's going on right here is we put a cell phone with time-lapse mode into this spinny it's called a camel app egg timer it's an egg timer cost 25 bucks then you turn your cell phone on to time-lapse mode you hit record it spins and captures a time-lapse it's amazing it's dirt cheap it looks like [Music] so that shot light captures New York City it captures the movement that happens here and that'll make up one tiny piece of this new cinematic oh good I'm getting on the boosted board okay we're shooting something right now that's like a moving time-lapse in front of one of my favorite restaurants in New York City Previn here is gonna shoot it he's really good at this stuff and basically I stand still the camera moves around me and it's this time-lapse but it's a really dynamic effect you go to stay behind so now we're gonna go get that exact shot in like two or three more locations and stitch them all together so it feels like a 360 all right so we're gonna finish the 360 so what we just shot was a 180 around me and now we're gonna do the 360 around we were going to do this in front of juice press so it looks like that Kinect on 180 and a 180 and you've got and then you've got a full circle and a juice for Dan I've gotten to know Casey pretty well and he doesn't do well standing throws this is gonna be kind of hard for him dude am I not in the shot I'm pretty sure what do we do we go just now yeah it's Ibiza he's a sweat marks from a hard-working South African male man you notice there's like a lot of friendly faces in New York City today more than I've ever seen you [Music] [Laughter] talk me through this last effect we're going to be doing here so imagine an infinite zoom slowly but then you just chop off the in and out points I don't understand what you're talking about there's nobody I understand what you're talking about so like no no let's just show show it again dad how are you do that getting hit by a car really he's doing a really long zoom zero then we're gonna do another zoom down there I start connecting the zooms together so you look like it's zooming zooming forever done guys so now we go one block closer do the same shot when we stitch all these together oh it's right here okay then looking good okay so this is going to be shot number two shot number two of either three or four to take us like a half a mile down Broadway right to the studio all right so this is three of four Darren green light green light green light [Music] [Laughter] it's a red light myself it doesn't even matter it's a red light [Music] no okay it is a red light guys having a bad day yeah that guy hurt your feelings yo dude didn't you watch my video amaretti sensitive rude I'm gonna go I'm gonna have a proper cry can we please I think I think today was a smashing success this intro is gonna be a Dan maced case you know it's that collabo Cola collab I'm gonna go run you'll send me that yeah I'll send it to you tonight accord I call it way to work on the knife you want you want to go run right now definitely but if any I don't have the stupid in it I mean I played I do you don't actually you know I didn't need a second run but I've been thinking about it all day very happy that I got it in okay and now I present for the first time ever the new I'm probably gonna change it but

            "data": "[Music] ten mil it's a super big deal I mean ten million subscribers ten million god you know I I when I started on YouTube the idea of 10 million seemed absolutely infallible I mean 10 million subscribers 10 10 million thanks guys I I just wanted to make this quick video to acknowledge 10 million and just to talk for a sec you know this isn't I I can't make a real video right now I've actually taken a little bit of time off from YouTube so I'm dealing with some kind of heavy personal right now but I did want to talk about 10 million what it means getting to getting to 10 million was absolutely not as hard as getting to a million you see between a million and ten million it just meant doing more of the same little bit of patience and a lot of hard work getting to getting to a million get into a million was not as hard as getting to a hundred thousand subs I saw the work people were responding to I made more of that I experimented I worked on building an audience I did all that and it took me from 100k to a million see getting to a hundred thousand subs was still not as hard as getting to ten thousand subs you see getting to ten thousand subs is the hardest thing to do on YouTube because at 0 nobody's tuning and nobody cares and at ten thousand it means you've built a meaningful audience so getting from zero to 10,000 finding your footing building a foundation on YouTube was the hardest thing to do and the moral of all this is that I think one piece of advice that people love to overlook especially young people enthusiasts energetic young people on YouTube love to overlook is patience it's something that my friend Gary Vaynerchuk talks about a lot but it's it's required to succeed in anything but especially on YouTube it's patience 2010 years they got a decade ago I started my youtube channel how old were you a decade ago like six the other big part of I think the other big part of when I look back at my success and what I've been able to do on YouTube the other big part has been you the audience and you know I have said before and I stand by this that I I think inspiration is highly overrated I think inspiration is just what takes you from zero to one and then to go from one to ten million is a combination of hard work and luck and all these other factors and I think the word inspire the word inspiration is wildly overused especially in this like sort of yippee social media world about inspiring others and here's an Instagram photo of a concern set aren't you inspired but that's not to say that inspiration doesn't play a role so I thought rather than just me sitting here bloviating about inspiring others or whatever I thought that I would share with you someone that I draw like an insane amount of inspiration from someone that I check in on every single day someone that I've never met I mostly follow him on Twitter and let me just show you this guy all right this is this is Dre Dre represents everything I love about social media [Music] all right so Dre is a guy I don't know him I just found him on social media but Dre's a guy who started I think 79 days ago he changed his Twitter handle to Dre the new me is coming and every day he posts these videos of himself just busting his ass working out to reinvent himself physically and he puts himself out there in a way that's so accessible and and anyway I'll link his YouTube channel I'll link his Twitter below just check this guy out but the reason why I'm singling out Dre today is because I think the magic of YouTube the magic of social media is its ability to bring people together and typically the only time mainstream outside whether its news media or any media attention gets shined on YouTube typically it's about something negative not something positive but for me it has been that positivity and it's been the connectedness and it's been the way that YouTube has opened up my world and be exposed to somebody like Dre I would never be able to find someone like him if it weren't for social media that is one of my like profound unrelenting love for YouTube and social media comes from all right that that's kind of it ten million uh I made this 10 million t-shirt because I think it's awesome it says 10 million here in my handwriting and then down here when you flip it up it says we did it summer 2018 and it says it says we not it says we not I did it because I just make the videos this community grew to 10 million because of because of you because of weed that's why it says we it's a great shirt it comes in black and white and I'm doing a super limited run of these shirts we're not gonna make that many but there's this young lady named Mari copening she's 11 years old she was in Flint Michigan I learned about her fundraiser this morning and I did all this research on this extraordinary young lady doing amazing things the hell her community and her most latest initiative here is to help fill up backpacks for kids who maybe can't afford school supplies and according to this GoFundMe it cost four bucks for her to fill up a backpack with all the supplies that youngster needs so for every one of these shirts were able to sell I'm gonna donate four bucks straight to her nonprofit she's looking to get to $50,000 she's currently at $28,000 I'm hoping that this will push her over the line of course if you'd rather donate instead of buy this shirt that's a great idea I'll link that below her link will also be on shop Casey Neistat comm and if there's any chance you're seeing this video mari keep up the good work I I can't wait to vote for you for president someday okay ten million I'll be back very soon once all this personal stuff blows over but thank you for what ten years of support and I have no intention of stopping or slowing down anytime soon [Music]",

regular viewer of this show you know just how much my happiness and good mood and just general positivity is tied to the weather you'd also know that all inter long I've been waiting for summer [Music] [Music] [Music] I'm trying to illustrate a point here which is that it rains a disproportionate amount of days in New York City but as I'm making charging and looking at the data I'm realizing it rains on average 11 to 15 percent of the days kind of making me feel like a little bit of a spur complaining about it so much maybe I should have looked this up before I did this whole scene so is it pouring and outside was it pouring rain outside today seems like an opportune day to make a video I've wanted to make for a very long time called I wanted to explain to you the audience exactly how I make my vlogs like what I see as the recipe for creating these videos first a quick history lesson I started vlogging in March of 2015 now before I started vlogging vlogging was typically individuals Karen like point-and-shoot cameras there were sort of documenting their day into a camera there was a much smaller genre back then and it was pretty linear day begins here day ends there come with me throughout my day I found the genre fascinating I was obsessed with like Ben Brown I was obsessed with fun for Louie I was obsessed with bf versus GF Charles Trippy was great I think what fascinated me the most about the horizontal is the idea of using your your life as a narrative for a daily series now when I made my HBO series this is a series I did my big brother van it was on HBO in 2010 we made it in 2008 that's 10 years ago my brother and I used our lives as a backdrop for a TV show but it wasn't so daily it wasn't so episodic instead we kind of plucked interestingness out of our lives share that interestingness is tiny little stories struggle stories together and call that a TV show episode so I'm one end of the spectrum we've got your daily vloggers in 2014-2015 sharing every aspect of their daily lives into a camera and on the other end of the spectrum we got this TV show that I made a decade ago where I share our little stories from my lives as short movies so I went to Belgium in 2015 this is a month before I started vlogging and I wanted to test that one thing what would happen if I sort of vlog about my trip but instead of talking into a camera I use really precise cinematography what would happen movie like cinematography but it's just me going about my daily life going into my hotel room coming out of my hotel room [Music] [Music] and I love that video that video work you should watch it points below and that got me super excited and that's when I made the decision that on my birthday 2015 I would start daily vlogging it wouldn't be this all day long and said I wanted to figure out how to make something that felt a lot more like a movie every day so that was the thinking that's what went through my head fire is starting to vlog so we're not understanding here are the foundational principles that I apply to almost every episode of this daily almost daily vlog number one the most important thing is of course the story but what is a story here's a super basic breakdown of a story and every good story follows this rule that is the rule of a three-act narrative you've got a beginning you've got a middle you've got an end set up conflict resolution Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch a pail of water act 1 Jack fell down and broke his crown act 2 Jill came tumbling after act 3 set up conflict resolution now in some episodes that super super super literal for example my all-time favorite episode of ever made of this vlog which is called my all-time greatest is such a literal example of set up conflict resolution it just felt so good to make that there's a set up here's what happened there's a conflict oh my god what's the outcome going to be and then there was a resolution happy ending that's not always so literal in every episode but I strive for that in every episode because that is what's at the core of a well-told story and a story is what drives any video like this and that right there was sort of promise or the deal that I made with myself was never an obligation to share with you the intimacy of every day of my life this isn't a journal but instead could I find everyday in my life a three-act narrative to share now a couple of the more granular aspects I always found it kind of hard to watch non-stop shaky camera vlogs it was disorienting it was always a little claustrophobic so so what I try to do is have an equal amount of handheld locked off shots locked off means on a tripod like this and then establishing shot the wide shot so it's establishing shots let you know where I am so it feels more like you're here with me these locked off shots let you the viewer forget about the camera for a second and focus on what I'm saying in the environment that I'm in and then the handheld shots like this enable you to sort of feel the spontaneity and the urgency that is whatever is taking place in my daily life hardware is then what cameras i use I have a simple rule for when it comes to hardware and that is always use the very best camera you have at your disposal so right now I'm shooting this on my big camera I'm shooting in 4k with a nice wide lens this is a perfect shot I've got a light right there I'm trying to make myself look good this is the best I have right now but when I'm out running in the morning and I want to film my run the best I have is my cell phone I keep a point-and-shoot in my backpack in case I don't have this big camera because the point shoot is a little bit more dynamic than just the cell phone so not to hold into any certain kind of hardware or any certain quality of hardware it's what I have access to cinematography part to hold the camera steady no one wants to watch you forsake you cinematography it hurts your brain it's hard to see what's going on it's not pleasurable for you the viewer and it's not easy for me the editor to put it together if it's super shaky if it's nonsensical it's go straight in the trash what's up Marlin almost off your pocket man I'm making a movie Marlin about how to make how I make my blog really yeah like it's not so much a tutorial but it's illusion of light how do aspects of I've never really shared right so you know what you should have done usually suffered me and then taught you sit with me in teach me all to do okay the next version of Casey and I stats logging secrets will be with Marlin we're in a peach and out of law cinematography part three time lapses and drones here's something very important no one gives a about your stupid time lapses your stupid drone shots that's something I remind myself in a daily basis that kind of cinematography only works if it's serving a greater purpose and for me it serves two purposes one is transitional so you'll notice sometimes like I'm outside wrapping up a scene where I'm doing something on my skateboard the next scene I'm in my studio doing something completely different and in between there might be a beautiful drone shot of the city or might be a beautiful time-lapse of the city I'm using it to get me from one scene or one aspect of the story to the next as that it's an incredibly effective tool the other place where it works is to show the audience a broader sort of a broader image of where you are and what's taking place in time drones in particular are great for that I'm at a hotel on a cool Beach and it doesn't really work pointing my camera the drone can give you context that otherwise couldn't [Music] [Applause] it's that kind of ambitious beautiful cinematography doesn't have a relationship with the narrative even if it's just a little relationship it feels out of place and it gets boring very very fast now there is a lot more depth and complexity to it than that things like where does being positive all the time start to just sound like total BS where people don't believe it things like when I'm feeling down and I want to share with you the audience I'm struggling with something how do I do that in a way that you actually care because we've all got our own problems why so think about yours it was like consistent narratives and you know if I'm on a trip that's five day long how do I make a five day episode arced about essentially the same subject there's a lot of depth to this but I hope that this serves the good sort of introduction into some of the thinking that I've had as I do this vlog I want to end this first kind of instructional sharing video by saying this probably the most important thing succeeding whether it's in the vlog in the YouTube game or in the creative space at all is this you have to have your own thing so if you follow this video perfectly and you make the most perfect kc blogs you will have failed before you begun they don't want to see your kc blog they want to see your your vlogs they want to see what you can bring to the table my favorite thing in the world is seeing how youtubers are able to iterate and build on other youtubers styles

country leave the east coast of the United States and they drive right to the middle of the country to a little town called Aspen Colorado [Music] [Music] hello and welcome to a new series here at 368 called story time at 3:16 yes I did just describe the plot to the movie Dumb and Dumber see I was like 12 years old when I saw that movie I saw in the theaters and it blew my mind it still stands it's one of the best comedies ever made I saw it with my best friend Joe and after leaving that movie we decided that immediately after high school he and I both would leave Connecticut leave New England and moved to Colorado this was the vision this was our dream this is what we wanted to do it's what we talked about every day in biology class this was the plan just a couple years later and a fight with my parents they end up running away from home when I was 15 freshman in high school and I get my very first girlfriend pregnant and when this happens I've to let go of all of my lofty dreams to support my kiddo which meant surrendering that plan to move to ask [Music] it's not gonna do us any good to sit here whining about it we're in a hole we're just gonna have to dig ourselves out so my birthday is March 25th and I started 368 I started this new series this new daily vlog the first week of April I wanted to do something special for my birthday this year say I need to be the last time I could like turn everything off before before this blog kicked off and that's something that I wanted to do is realize that like 12 year old Casey dream of going to Colorado with my day one homies and just skiing and like got room for one more if you still want to go to Aspen and that was exactly what we did this is the beginning of the trip we're headed to Aspen now [Music] [Applause] first my friends that's Peter his dad my dad's best friends they were friends before we were we've known each other since before either of us were alive Andy Andy aka Chuck J he now on the same lacrosse team together in in sixth grade and I ran cross-country together in seventh grade that's the guy who taught me how to do a 360 on a BMX bike going off a dirt ramp and then Joe Joe is my number one ace homie my best friend since childhood that I was always been there for me that's Joe were there [Music] now cut out of your 1999 I live in a trailer park I wash dishes to support my family and I had a tiny little baby now I would spend all my days at home watching that baby because I worked nights and I remember a number of times joe-joe coming to sit in my trailer parking hanging out and we just sat there on the floor of my trailer playing Sega Dreamcast on my 27-inch Trinitron glass CRT television when you have very little you spend a lot of time thinking about what you would do if someday you had more means you had greater means or resources and for me it was always about doing something fun and something special for my friends who were there for me when I had nothing [Music] we see it in hotel that was raped by the base of the mountain it had an outdoor swimming pool even though there was snow on the ground [Music] you were six horses made of sticks back and she were white I was winning the fight bang bang he shot me down the ground bang-bang my baby shot me down seasons came and change the time when I got back [Music] my baby shot me down [Music] we'd wake up every morning at the crack of dawn so you'd be first on the mountain you skied the entire day and then by four o'clock we like exhausted after eight hours of skiing and we went to bed by 8 or 9 o'clock we are not high schoolers anymore they weren't we're adults we have families we have jobs we have responsibilities and as you know as you grow up and those responsibilities become and those responsibilities consume more and more of who you are the opportunities to do things like go skiing for a couple of days just for the covet those opportunities are few and far between that was never lost on us we appreciated that every second of every day [Music] I think the takeaway for me is that that was on its surface nothing more than a couple of friends going skiing but underneath that was kind of a lifetime of dreams and ambitions and friendships and fun and and memories and all those other things you Harbor and they fester in your brain this was the physical manifestation of that this was the realization of that a life not shared is a life not lived and having the same friends for decades of my life really really made me appreciate that you know 1994 is also the year that that Biggie Smalls dropped his seminal album ready to die with the smash hit juicy age-old story of coming from a place where you have next to nothing in getting to a place that that you one day dreamed of arriving at and sharing that with the people that you care about and that's what this stupid meaningless broski trip was all about see you tomorrow on three six eight on tomorrow's episode of three six eight [Music] so I can't breathe [Music]",

always up between 4:00 and 5:00 cup of coffee then I sit down at my computer this is my favorite part see it's these early morning hours that are the absolute most productive for me no phone calls no texts messages nothing's happening on social media everyone else is asleep it's just total focus that gives me between 5 &amp; 7 a.m. to get some work done 2 full hours before Francine's up when she's up we make breakfast [Music] she leaves for school at 7:30 by 8 o'clock I'm out the door on my run my run always happens for me running this alone time is top priorities back from the run before 10:00 shower shave get out door I need to work the commute to work it's fast a 5-minute ride or so I didn't know what I was going til you said turn try to always be in the office by 10:00 and then it works until I was sad yeah busy work email work phone calls work sitting my office eating in my office pass to the outside were having one 3 6 8 or meeting work meetings work meeting with this guy were talking to her was getting it done work leave the office before 6 6 o'clock headed home 6 to 10 6 to 10 is family time and it's non-negotiable babies asleep before 10 I know she should be asleep sooner were terrible parents baby's asleep at 10 I go to the gym from 10:00 to 11:00 11 o'clock I pass out Levi what time what time do you wake up no I am Number 1 just on a practical side if you wake up early in the morning like at 4:30 in the morning you're gonna have some free time to yourself to make things happen to take care of things that are important to you let's say you're the most ultra motivated guy in the world when that alarm clock goes off there's at least 50% of the time where you just met that soft little pillow is just caressing your head and you want to stay there and it takes discipline to go nope I'm gonna get up out of this bed I'm gonna do what I'm supposed to do and that discipline that you have at that moment you win that fight that's a big victory and then that that that pattern will carry out throughout the day because once you're up well now and I'm up I might as well go work out because I'm already up and I I feel good that I got up out of bed and I won that battle let me go win another battle I'm gonna go get it done and then when you show up at the office and there's someone that's got a big box of doughnuts that they're given away for free by the way so they're just sitting it's almost like an insult not to take them but when you've already gotten up early you had the discipline there you already worked out you have the discipline there and now you see the box of doughnuts you're like no I'm not gonna eat the doughnuts no no doughnuts you're not gonna do it and that discipline carries on throughout the day so now you take that and you you expand that out over a week in a month and you end up with more discipline and it starts with that simple act of getting up and getting out of bed in the morning discipline starts every day when the first alarm clock goes off in the morning I say first alarm clock because I have three the moment the alarm goes off is the first test it sets the tone for the rest of the day the test is not a complex one when the alarm goes off if you get up out of bed Ruy there in comfort and fall back to sleep if you have the discipline to get out of bed you win if you are mentally weak for that moment and you let that weakness keep you in bed you fail though it seems small that weakness translates to more significant decisions but if you exercise discipline that too translates to more substantial elements of your life okay Jacqueline let me try to butcher your bio a little bit you you were a Navy SEAL commander Lieutenant Commander in the Navy SEALs you did how many tours in Iraq I did two tours in Iraq and then you actually you actually you were a Navy SEAL instructor so then you took your learnings from the battlefield and you taught future generations of seals what you learned yeah and a lot of times when people think about SEAL instructor they think of what you see on TV or SEAL team we're here to get you out that's not actually the instructing that I did the instructing that I did was four seals that had already been through that basic training and maybe they'd made multiple deployments overseas but a seal platoon has to prepare and work together and get to know each other and learn how to function together as a team and in order to to in order to get there they go through pretty arduous training actually extremely arduous training and that was the training that I ran sometimes even if you're the most highly motivated person in the world that grind starts to beat you down a little bit and that's when you have to stop looking at the short-term thing because that's not that's not getting you to get it done and you got to look okay what is the long-term goal that I'm looking at what am I really trying to get done in the long term and you say oh you know what I'm actually waking up today early so I can be ahead of the curve so I can sell more of these widgets or whatever so I can buy a house and you know what today matters today matters this decision that I'm making right now is that first step it's me taking one stroke swimming in the right direction heading towards the shore and if I don't take this I'm not making any progress okay Chacko one piece of advice for someone who's thinking about whether it's waking up earlier just having more discipline in their day one piece okay discipline equals freedom that that's the best to keep you surprised so listen here have you written a book called that I did I did write a book it's right here yeah the discipline it was freedom we all want freedom right we all want to have freedom we want we want to have financial freedom we want to have more free time we don't have physical freedom that's what we want everyone wants freedom of course but if you want to have freedom in your life the way to get to freedom is is through discipline it's that's how you get there so if you want to be if you want to be financially free you have to have financial discipline you have to save your money you have to work hard to earn more money you have to not buy by stupid things that you don't actually need right you need to save that money and invest it properly if all that takes discipline and if you have that kind of discipline you'll end up with more freedom if you want to be if you wanna have more free time everybody wants more free time but if you want more free time how are you gonna get it you have to have more discipline time management less fortnight more work when you get done doing something that's a complete waste of time how do you feel at the end of it all right terrible yeah you feel happy while you're doing it oh this is kind of fun this is this is stimulating my brain a little bit and then you get done with it and you realize that you could have done something productive and you don't feel good about just this play this guy why buckets of cold oatmeal every day I don't care about it just it's just healthy and I feel good all day oh yeah that's that's a great example cuz everybody knows that when you're eating that cheeseburger I mean come on good but how but literally how bad do you feel 30 38 minutes when you've got done eating a cheeseburger and fries you're you're you're suffering if you are at work I yeah what about the people that blame circumstance for not being able to take ownership and build that discipline so they're just constantly like pointing outside themselves how do they like acknowledge that but no I have the opportunity right now yeah but that's that's the fundamental core of of where this is a problem is when people look around and they blame they but if they're in business they blame the market or they blame their competitors or if their personal life they being with their family they blame their parents they blame everyone else and they never look at themselves and say you know what maybe it's not this is my fault but what can I do about it [Music] I'm at a station I'm never gonna find attract surprises you stand so the question I get asked most often about my schedule is where do you find where do I find the hours like how am I not exhausted all the time from waking up so uh see your hours of the day that time time is fungible meaning you can take hours from one part of your day and move it to another part of the day so I made a decision to take two worthless hours those the hours between 11:00 p.m. and 1:00 a.m. those are like Netflix and chill hours I took those hours totally unproductive hours I moved them to 5:00 a.m. to 7:00 a.m. so what used to be totally wasted hours are now totally useful hours so now I go to bed at 11:00 but I get up at 5:00 and instead of having two hours of nonsense I have two hours of a hyper productivity first thing in the morning [Music] Jaakko has a fantastic podcast and a whole bunch of books including this new one everything is linked below go check them out this is great right uh well I guess so you said the modesty this one this is the book that I've read it's fantastic it's so good okay and the kids books those kids books thanks for coming by Jacko thanks for having me man appreciate it you",

things like you know damn I got a question yes my sir last night at the house where Adelaide mm-hmm do you remember opening a bag of a pink bag of Hello Kitty marshmallows yes she was saving these so you did open them and before you open them they were completely unknowable right and did I do something bad those were Francine's special marshmallows for her special trip and you opened them down and you open them [Music] this camera here it doesn't have doesn't have like a flip out so I have to plug in an external monitor but there was a minor mishap last week I ganked the camera and I'm still connected to this thing and this thing just well I kinda it broke it broke in like a million pieces and one of the bits that I couldn't figure out a properly fix was the part that connected to like the the tripod mount so my fix here is just to permanently attach it to this little gorilla pod your try hot glue [Music] it's totally works okay do you know who Buster Keaton is Buster Keaton is one of my favorite like movie makers of all time he's a guy who he's a kind of started making movies in the movie business when the world of movies was where the world of like YouTube is right now meaning there was like no road map there was no like defined style or like genre you could invent things like vlogging was invented in the last five years and he invented okay whatever just watch this ready [Music] all right he really he's really doing this like he really did that those stunts are all real there's no special effects like nope that's all like he's actually doing these things and he did this at a time when like nobody knew what motion picture or moving images could be used for and this was the stuff that he would come up with in his head you know much work it must have taken for that one joke but I bring him up because there is definitely a parallel between him a hundred years ago trying to figure out what movies could be and the entire YouTube community right now trying to figure out what can be done here [Music] okay see this right here just above the beam see the beam just above the beam that is the Japanese the Japanese grocery store it's this awesome place that sells all like something you only get in Japan but they import it here but you came and tailed it came and tell it's up there look that's a coffee shop and up there where the broccoli is and that lot and those

make sure you check it to make sure it's not empty fortunately this blew out all by it this video is kind of a nothing video mostly I just wanted to bring you up to speed share with you you know when I'm daily vlogging you know I feel like there's a really great opportunity to have an open-ended conversation with you the audience bringing you up to speed with what I'm up to in my life and my channel ambitions and everything else but now that I post irregularly irregular I don't feel like I have that calm I don't feel like I have that opportunity so this is just like a good old-fashioned update video ten things ten things I need to bring you up to speed on number one if you send me a letter or maybe or maybe a package helmet or a futuristic fan and you haven't received a thank-you from me please know that I am working on it I just I get a lot which I appreciate and it takes me a long time to get through all of these you know for what it's worth a lot of my youtuber friends told me that they've shut down their Pio boxes and stuff this just becomes too much of a hassle I do not see it as a hassle I love receiving packages in mail I just try to be realistic with update number two I haven't shaved in about a week I'm not one for facial hair but I had a really good excuse for all of the last week I've been on this like it was like a romantic because it was Candace and me but we had a bunch of our friends with us but no children no babies we left them at home with Candace's parents but I'm like this crazy wild romantic honeymoon like vacation we all went on a cruise through like the Caribbean and we stopped these islands and went for like hikes and then at night we can decide midway in almost a year and a half without the kid oh it was amazing I didn't shoot any video about it but it was such a wild experience I feel like I have to make a movie about it somehow so I might try to get all of like the cell phone clips that everybody took on that trip and turn that into a video but yeah I grew some facial hair and got this fantastic tan I'm a romantic holiday [Music] [Music] my holiday video a little bit about that video if you haven't seen it we you know every year Samsung wants me to do a big video with them and they are willing to kind of support whatever crazy idea I have and last year's about me dressing up a Santa and flying around on the snowboard behind a drone this year I want to do something it was much more about giving back if you haven't seen it we turned an old shopping mall it's like this winter wonderland then we invited like a hundred plus underprivileged kids to come there and make youtube videos with us it is opportunities like that and getting to do like that that is the very reason why I want to be a youtuber and I'm psyched to be a youtuber it wasn't just me either we had there were 18 youtubers that we flew in from like around the country around the world to help us realize this thing and you know all of it was to benefit the Boys and Girls Club which is an organization that helps underprivileged kids that don't have much to do after school and they've received a whole bunch of attention by the way I'll link them below if you want to make a donation or just go say hi unbelievable organization but that was my holiday video thank you for just the overwhelming support especially thank you from the girls and boys merch this merch my current merch store you know I have three items for sale this is an experiment this is something I wanted to see if there was interest in I wanted to see if I liked the process and the short answer to all that is this is awesome and I want to be more than just t-shirts and sweatshirts I want to figure out how to like how to have like a place where I can sell all the crap that I'm interested in that maybe you're interested in a place where I can work with like nonprofits to raise all the money and do fundraisers that I like to do a place that's like I don't like a big fat commerce site or online commerce place where I can do more than just sell t-shirts and sweatshirts maybe I've been spending too much time my friend Peter McKinnon but in 2018 not to make much more of an effort to make the process of creating a bigger part of mine of my video narrative it's something I talked a lot about like in 2000 season one of the bloggers I talked a lot about the gear I use and how I got the shots that I got I've gotten away from that I only get back to that just as a quick nod to that you'll notice that this video and the videos that I'll be posting in the near future anyways are not 4k I've gone back to 1080 instead I'm trying to focus on a sharper focus and a shallower depth of field I want to make these videos a little bit more cinematic in order to do that I'm letting go of the higher resolution and I'm embracing sort of better dynamic range in better color science and and the kinds of aesthetic values that I prioritize during the first season of my vlog and that brings up one of the bigger questions that I asked myself especially looking to the future and that is what is this channel you know a year ago at this time I just stopped vlogging CNN just bought my company I had no idea what 2017 might bring in 2017 for me was a bit of a scramble like I I wasn't sure where this channel fit in I started vlogging again but that didn't feel rights that I just went to uploading with some consistency but then I would sit it was a mess and when I looked at 2018 I don't specifically know what I want to do but I do know that regular uploads and having a very specific sort of narrative agenda behind this channel is going to be a priority of mine I just think for my own well-being like when I told myself the first season of the vlog was gonna post a video every single day no matter what that was such like good guidance for me it was very helpful for me creatively and I want to kind of give myself a mission like that for 2018 with this YouTube channel this closet the podcast we're doing it a hundred percent guaranteed positively fully committed we're doing the podcast we just want to rush into it we're gonna do it in 2018 in January a few weeks from now but we needed to take this time to figure out how to do it best practices do we get a studio to be knocking the studio sound quality distribution methods all those things we're figuring out right now but we're doing it the immediate future so like I said I was on that romantic vacation for the last week no vlogging for that no making videos for that I leave in two more days for another trip this is a family trip we're going to see Candace's family it's like a big thing I'll be gone for another like 8 or 10 days or something I want to try and not make videos while I'm there as well I find taking these big breaks lets my brain clear up and it lets me enjoy my time with my family but that doesn't mean I'm not going to upload have a couple of videos that I shot they've just been sitting on my hard drive from like the weeks passed I want to share those videos and then I have one like ace in the hole this video that I was working on like months and months and months ago when I finished sounds like it's not good enough and then we revisited it I'm gonna release release that in the next couple of days and that's a video I'm really excited about that video is gonna be my new channel trailer okay thank you - PO - zoo for sending me these awesome Star Wars shoes check out my Teddy fresh hat gah do you know this stuff is so good alright and my last thing on my list of things to update you with this is something I'm very excited about something I've been looking forward to sharing with you [Music] remember juice press the juice place I still come to in like every single episode my buddy owns this place check this out how's the hot sauce selling good where is it I've got my own juice press hot sauce have you tried it what do you think CII I want to figure out how to sell these in the merge store but for now it's just kind of like a fun thing that I'm doing with the with the owner of juice press which is like a local New York City G shop Marcus is my homie I'd do anything to support this place but come on dip it put my face on a hot sauce bottle also I was paid for this in juice all right it's not exciting update number 10 until I figure out how to put these on my merch site just simply come to downtown Manhattan and come come to this juice press and buy yourself a bottle of uh KC hot sauce how much is the KC hot sauce top $5 all right so dust consists thus concludes my exactly ten part update video and here's the future [Music]",

lived in a one-bedroom studio there was like a hundred degrees out in that air-conditioned mat that was his inspiration for that song great song [Applause] don't be afraid it's not like you're in Arizona or someone like that it's not crazy hot but look 93 that's pretty hot for New York City ah something I really like to do here on YouTube is find smaller or newer or less well-known youtubers and then share those youtubers that I really like with you my audience I like to do that because it kind of gives them a little bit more exposure and I like to think that if you watch this channel that you're also interested in what I'm interested in any event I have a youtuber that's coming by right now that I'm very excited for you to meet but first [Music] she's here hello wait wait am i looking yes it right now right there there God okay got it this is Molly Molly G youtuber we met at VidCon yes okay and this is how it went I walk into some lounge or something like that they're all over Pacifica I heard somebody whisper I think that's Casey nice dad and I think I like tiny hear that a lot so I didn't think much of it I turned around and went to see you said that so I could say hi and then I saw this rule right here say well is it him or is it not him and whoever you see news like I can't tell him you like well I can't tell I'm blind I can't see him is it Casey or not that time at Molly and that's how I found out that you can't see yes so how is someone both blind and a youtuber Molly well there was a bit more that went into the decision to make youtube videos and maybe for most people because obviously like I can't set up my camera on my lighting I can't make sure I'm in focus I can't edit my videos and so there was there was more that had to go into figuring all that out and my mom comes down and she films with me so she'll make sure I'm in focus she takes the thumbnail so in short I always have a mom that you trust to tell you you look good on camera I would say I'm like Cinderella I have my own talking mirror everywhere I go and mine ears name is mom have you always been blind I've always been visually impaired I haven't always been blind until I was 14 and in grade 8 the disease was kind of triggered and I lost pretty much the majority of my vision to what I have now what can you see now like what do you see now like there's a bright light there's bright light and then there's me and there's I can't like what what do you see so I see the world in light and shadow I can see light so I can see that there's a big square of light and like I can see that there's a little bulb above us and that there's different light and that there's strips of lighting on the ceiling I have is like globe light pane over there but I can't see or no depth perception rather so I don't know if that light is in touching distance or if it's far away can you see me at all see when you like look towards the light and stop I can see that there's their shining on your glasses so if I sit right there I can see that your glasses all right they're two little spots that's all I see so then everything around those two little spots reflecting off your glasses is totally black so you don't know what I look like not at all before you lost your vision did you ever see a movie with Brad Pitt in it what got you to a place of wanting to share so much of who you are in your life to the world Florine been a big problem it was a big part of my life when I lost my vision I also lost all of my friends and and so I could take this negative thing that happened to me and make it something positive for other people we're going to go outside now and Molly's unit share with me what it's like to be visually impaired right mm-hmm I'm going to borrow your scarf okay buddy hey buddy thank you [Music] all right blindfold on ready to go okay so you just have to trust that I can't see it is this recording Zach yeah give address that I can't do this so a lot of people when they like want to help a blind person might try to grab our hand or push us or grab our shoulders not the right thing to do probably over offer the elbow so you're going to grab my right elbow cuz gallop is trained to always be on my left so the boom I'm going to come over in front of you so I sit on your lap right okay yeah well just know how many like axes and things are hanging in this studio I've never been so scared in my own office before okay yes on the button every is on the left 500 I'm out I think a fire thing we won't we don't want there that I have done do your Braille on the button we're working on this new stressing you guys write down and not just their family they're Israel right no this is interesting for both of us see I are seeing different accessibility as I said we're going about yeah I do too I think we're gonna have a long elevator ride oh I gotta be this is the first floor second floor second could you push the button for the first floor please gasps softly okay we have successfully made it to the front door Oh however there is no oh god no let's go left affiliate coffee okay ah we're going to hit the streets soon across the street and at the end of the next block is a coffee shop on the left and what do you do what do we do so hopefully walk by how do you know when they're coming to have well yes Alyssa that sounded like traffic was going south it not endow the booth but now flick traffic has always been going up okay let's just risk it I might kill you today but I appreciate that you're taking this breast with me how do we know we're up the curb Galvez off where the curb police also stares verbs like nothing to find the door so when I get to the corner then I'll ask him to find the door yes do you smell like everything see you learn like he looks like old eerie music from that store into the south so it's positive oh I'm talking out goes okay you so much yes how do you know whether it's your turn order is it my turn order yes that's how I know so how do you notice someone's dropping you often we go really but how do I touch their country you have to ask them to help you you know how do you know like what sugar to put into your coffee I asked okay so I'm going to take off my blindfold Wow that was an absolutely like jarring experience for me it was really like everything I knew about life here hearing it in a different once we recessed did you're experiencing it with your ears with your nose with your hands like I always say my hands are my eyes because I'm always a touching thing my more than that like you know you know in a weird way and I said it very gently it was much scarier the phrase I didn't touch somebody but I was afraid that she was unitard me too much my coffee they never would hear resident and gentleman from their perfect unfree ruining it by car as a pre we're going to offend the people around us how the princess doesn't even get the right coffee like I think how you think you know what this is I always helpful for you I just bring you into this experience and you've never done it before of course it's going to feel really scary and it's probably going to feel overwhelming and it's probably going to feel like you can't do it but the reality is this is lying on this is my everyday and for people who are in wheelchairs for people who are blind for people who are deaf or missing a limb this is our normal you know I've been blind for nine years I don't know life's excitement so for me asking for people to help me all the time or for me listening to the traffic surges or for me listening and smelling different places know where I am is north and so to me it's not difficult and it's not scary and it's not jarring it's not and it's just like I wake up I do my makeup I make my breakfast I see your overcoat I do my own makeup yep she's my own outfit you know I do I just live like Molly before you go I made a present for you what okay it's here oh my goodness story of my own Casey sunglasses yes I made you a custom pair of my sunglass the other look on you then look right on you look at this I even engraved your name on the side oh there's a note on that side and then what is it say thanks what about them we'll figure let's see how we both slept with her they look good on you they fit you very well well I thank you for coming by thank you for you for the lighting we come by vision in terror we say blank why thank you black-and-white on a hot summer don't be afraid of aluminate ha [Music]",

I saw on Twitter God look how good hers is ready it's funny every single time differences that's real do you think that's real magic do you think that mine is as funny of that no you can be honest look good no comment the whole scene is okay welcome to 360 [Music] okay so I don't know if you know Evans channel or not you should if you don't I'll link it below but great very smart channel and we were just having a conversation about editing like editing videos with y'all what the hell are we saying just how editing is really yeah we were talking about outsourcing like I had my managers are constantly asking me to outsource parts of my show so that I can free up time to be more productive with other things and I just can't possibly see how that would work and I've tried like people always say when I bitch about how busy I am everyone's always like get an editor yeah get an editor I tried or people are like cool that Dan edits to your videos Dan that's what I thought I thought he edited a incredibly talented but he doesn't come anywhere near these edits sometimes he color corrects me doesn't do the edits and of the 800 videos I have in my channel I've yet to find somebody who can edit my voice yeah literally the milliseconds between two lines in a voiceover I am spending probably 15 minutes moving that audio file like zooming in all the way and moving it just a tiny little bit playing it over and saying is that pause enough to get to jump it into the next thing is the momentum the right way like I can't imagine anyone anyone because that's your brain yeah it's very frustrating when you see comments and notes where people are so dismissive of editing as if it's like putting gasoline in your car like it's an objective process or a mechanical process the art is in the Edit and the fun is in the Edit - I don't agree with that well I mean I know like I enter like a flow State in editing it's when you finish the Edit there's nothing more satisfying yeah and there's nothing more disturbing than realizing you haven't eaten for 13 hours okay Evan in Casey discuss editing [Music] hello and welcome to tech review Tuesday tech review Tuesday were and I review a piece of technology that I'm interested in or curious about and share my findings with you on this week's episode I'm going to be reviewing the new DJI Ronin s video stabilizer but before I do that I wanted to share with you some technology that I think is really really cool I'm not going to review I just want to just want to show you this this is made by a small company out of Detroit called shinola and what's cool about this company shinola the company was started when all of the auto workers in Detroit were losing their jobs and this company was started to put all those like skilled workers to work making other things in addition to making watches and handbags and all that stuff they made they did a super super limited edition run they made 500 of these things this is a proper turntable like a record player shinola as we were sort of building out what the audio system should be down at 368 I was like I was like let's use this handmade american-made Detroit made and turntable I don't know record players but this is just the bit that sits on it this probably weighs like 20 pounds this is like a piece of jewelry Wow [Music] [Laughter] [Music] now I'm no audiophile I'm not like one of those music guys but the audio difference from like something like this like an actual record with high quality speakers versus like I usually do like ear pods and Spotify myself the sound quality is unbelievably different okay so now for the tech review part of tech review Tuesday this is the Ronin s the roving 2's is a a gimbal for SLR cameras made by DJI the same company that makes all the drones that I and everybody else the world uses designed is the all-in-one workhorse for almost any type of filmic Ronin s is packed with incredible features that offer the ultimate flexibility for single or multiple operators on any set [Music] a 3-axis gimbal is basically a mechanism to make sure a camera stays steady as it's recording as it's moving this is a three axis gimbal by GoPro and see in theory anyways no matter how much I move this handle the camera stays in sort of the same position this right here this is a gimbal on the bottom of a drone same idea you put the camera here no matter how you move your hand it stays in one position what was typically used for stabilizers for bigger cameras or something like this this is a really fantastic device made by movi you put the you put a camera down here and then no matter how you move this thing it stays stable amazing device this is how I shot the snowboarding in New York City movie and the Aladdin video was with this bad boy but it's a little bit big a little unruly you have to actually have a stand just to put the thing down from where I gathered the Ronin s is kind of the answer to all of that it's a small handheld stabilizer that does what the big one that does what the big one does but is the size of one of the smaller more miniaturized gimbals it totally Crittenden let's do this so was lovin right so this thing does a lot more features than what we're playing with it for today there's an app that works with it that you can program you to really complicated time lapse features the Ronin s app complements the gimbal giving filmmakers even greater control over their creativity wherever your passion takes you I've only used it for about fifteen minutes it feels super simple how's your arm I mean it's heavy it is heavy it takes one hand you can definitely operate it with one hand there is something I liked about it which is the you can have a microphone on this like I do here and still have it work on the gimbal and still be as stable as can be which is pretty amazing oh the selfie mode is really good too like your gorilla pod I mean you have a really good grip on it so you have stable shots but all you have to do is hold that thing you'll get really stable yeah if you're like a sociopath when it comes to making vlogs you could shoot this all of your vlogs on something like this like look this is me using this as if it's a selfie stick slip on you have to have strong forearms this thing about double the weight doubles the weight of the camera but it is amazing that this replaces such a gigantic piece of hardware alright so we do some shots through the trees now yeah let's some cinema [Music] oh okay that concludes the first look of the Ronin s3 accent three axis stabilizer huge fat thumbs up take it for what it's worth though because we've only had three hours with this issue just starting to play with it so far very impressed I do want to flag that I I have a plan to shoot an entire episode of three six eight using just this gimbal to give it right to give like a really comprehensive review of all the details and all the features that this thing does that'll come soon for now though good work DJI and would you look at this look at this beauty right now [Music] [Music] you [Music]",

are done that can pick them up so I'm just waiting to hear from him but I'm pretty sure today's the day that the pants are ready this term this term called planned obsolescence and in the most simple terms what that means is when something that's designed or actually built to replace like something that is designed to be replaced for example when cars first came out way back in the day these things were bomb-proof they could be fixed they could be repaired they lasted forever then when everybody who kind of wanted a car had a car if the car industry needed to create a reason people to buy new cars so they started designing them differently and promote artificial reasons for people to replace what they already have planned obsolescence now we live in a disposable culture where everything you buy is meant to be used up and then thrown away and then bought again that's not always a bad thing for example it makes things less expensive cars now they're all made out of plastic and they're not meant to last 3040 years but they're safer they're cheaper they're lighter they're easier to produce that's it I'm not a plan of disposability I like to fix things I like to build things part of the reason why boosted board so much my biggest beef with the boosted board is how damn expensive ridiculously astronomically expensive these electric skateboards are when I give Sanjay the CEO for our expensive these things are his response is always the same these things are designed and built to be repaired and fixed and a lot of the cost of those repairs are built into the cost of the skateboards and I will say I've had to send mine back a bunch of time they're all like modular part engine can be replayed all can be replayed wheels come off that can be replace the fantastic battery can be replaced everything on this is built to be replaced and fixed this is not a disposable object so I like it this studio is a testament to my love or affinity for repairing instead of replacing or building instead of buying like this is this plumbing pipe implied with all healthy other wood screws as a little tool area just so I can build out and fix and repair this studio space by myself instead of throwing away crappy furniture and replacing it with equally crappy furniture I like to make things I like to fix things so why the diatribe about planned obsolescence okay my what's up my favorite pair of jeans from my favorite jeans store completely fell apart on me so I just beat the SH out of them and I sent them back and he fix them and not only doctor like fixing his products as part of his business and I love that did the CMS does Araki ones' teen shop I'm doing a whole like thing about planned obsolescence and why I like to fix things instead of replace things so my question for you is why do you bought why do you fix teens instead of just encouraging people to buy new ones we do both you got to be booked but when you fall in love with your jeans or your favorite your favorite thing in life and they tell story all your jeans tell a great story you don't wanna give up so quick so we fix who these those are God used to work here you know these is just an art piece now that's an option to display Wow all right where my pants at all holes are Pat how did you across filming cities are my favorite pant these are my favorite pants they completely sort of disintegrated budgets beat on them so much when layoffs which were here to experience aw but this is not like a paid advertisement or anything Eric's just an old friend and I'm just a dissipating the whole operation okay I forgot that part of the story the reason why we initially met I made a video about this but I was hit on my motorcycle the ambulance cut the pants off of me I sent him to shredded up pants it was sent me a new pair that's how friendships are born so we saw that I was like you in 2007 the book amazing all right you not a paid advertisement just a friend but if you find

            "data": "[Music] so what's happening here I happen to be in Toronto for work engagement I got back from Amsterdam where Pierre was with me in Amsterdam like yesterday we both posted fun videos this morning of us hanging out Amsterdam now everybody has all these questions everybody wants more and more more it's like here do you have like an hour cuz I've got a lunch break for my work thing and we're making movies but this isn't this isn't your house no this is my house I wish it was my house we're gonna be allowed to use it uh-huh we're gonna break into it the best ever there in Japan right now and they're like yeah talk to the guy at the front desk and maybe you make it happen [Music] yes and no make your apartments there it's 1257 now I feed back my cheese that's doable right planning space plenty of space doing fine I know the face you're giving the camera Peter you are a much much much better cinematographer than you are plenty of room planning room you got it Lanny roof and we're good thank you thank you look at that Park job okay thank you Wow look at that you imma cannon slide in here is there any light on my face I don't know those I like that frame you could see the tower behind us they're great let me just cheat yourself I got a little close with this thing's all wobbly so largely because we only have a short amount of time but also because Peters such an aficionado when it comes to cinematography and camera gear and and all those things I thought it might be an appropriate Q&amp;A ready I'm ready Butch Hartman question we want to do a collab with me yes I do but Hartman that's the guy that drew Fairly OddParents you know this guy I know this guy [Music] right yeah we're gonna do a hundo peak lab what are mistakes you see people making with storytelling I think a misconception of storytelling is that you need like a hero and a villain and it has to be like a classical like you know a plot whereas a story can just be something very basic from moving from point A to point B doesn't to be so literal that's right that's right it's my thinking that best Airport you've been to probably Hong Kong or I like to Amsterdam oh oh no no Doha it has a swimming pool in it oh hands-down winner [Music] so Dan asks when shooting a vlog are all of your shots done in sequence or do you film a talking ahead segment then go back and b-roll and my answer to that is I don't always shoot in sequence no in fact the video that I made yesterday of us in the Amsterdam so the anchor that videos me interviewing you we shot that the next day and then I used that as like a narrative bed for the rest of the episode yeah there's tons of times where I actually film a vlog over like three days time and I wear the same clothes and then just cut it in to make it feel like it was all done the same day Rick wants to know when do you guys get married we're not I think they're getting the wrong I don't understand that we like to collaborate in the videos we've made one video interesting how do you feel the people looking at you as a crazy person when you're talking into a camera I find it very hard if you're worried that much about what people think of you you probably should not try to be a youtuber I mean there's always something a little weird about it oh it's weird you just gotta oh yeah oh yeah try vlogging with a GoPro on your head that's the most weird it's ever been for me what color profile do you use Casey no answer I have no idea yeah okay I shoot flat so if I had a log color profile on my cameras I would use that but I shoot everything flat so that it color grades better in post he's good when you sit down out of the vlog do you have an entire idea of how you want the entire thing to play out or do you dive in headfirst and see what you can create I almost always know before I start to edit what I'm doing but I assemble it and I really tighten up the story in the Edit I need to be better at that because I a lot of the time just like fly by the seat of my pants I'm starting to edit and I'm like oh I like where this is going and then I have some ideas but that is not my preferred method of creating I would much rather have it planned we gotta go let's go we gotta go this is the Q&amp;A is not over we got to go to the whose apartment is this melissa alejandro dear Melissa I don't think Jim listen Alejandra thank you for letting us use your apartment it was a great [Music] you got this all right right back right right back keep it straight you got it straight you're good plenty of distance 75 feet six suck it up funny his face cut the wheel straighten her out cut the wheel the other way straighten her out turn the wheel you know that scene and Austin Powers as a youtuber how do you create original content when it seems like everything has already been done yeah I'll hit that one off you have to tell your story if I've told all of my stories and piers told all of his stories which neither of us have it doesn't change the fact that nobody knows your story so the written language has been around since hieroglyphics thousands of years there are still new stories being told every single day not everything's been done it's up to you to find your own voice on YouTube and nobody can do that better than you that was good that was like I was I feel like I was being kind of aggressive there and then you were kind of like the super nice just want to bring it home you know I'm headed back to my event now great question here do you see Peter as a competitor or as a friend no as a friend but I said anything about all youtubers anyone who works in the space is big as YouTube and thinks that somebody else's success is gonna slow them down is sorely mistaken YouTube is not at all a zero-sum game it is the more people who can succeed on this platform the more we will all succeed on this platform like simply put the Internet is big enough for everyone yeah are you coming to the event with me I'm just gonna walk in I don't have a pass for you I used to be a magician [Music] great a great day Canada dude good to see you thank you taking me up thanks for all of your

that's so exciting I'd really missed it since beam so this is a meeting about that but more on that later hope everyone's okay three things three things have been on my mind all day they've really been occupying me so here goes number one very very very good news I am typically not an emotional person but this news makes me want to cry a little bit I found this out last night for the first time in my whole life I am now an uncle yesterday there was a new addition to the nice stat brood a beautiful healthy baby and everyone's doing great and it's very exciting that's been like this little dopamine thing in my brain all day that's just like happiness happiness happiness number two and I don't know how to feel about this I guess I'm like okay I shared with you like a week ago or two weeks ago about my grandmother passing away which is really just sad and a real bummer but this weekend instead of a regular traditional funeral the entire family the extended family is getting together up in New England like six hours from New York City I feel okay about it because while it's very sad it her not being here is very sad and her passing was very sad but the act of celebrating it as a big family is very positive and I do feel good about that so that's number three this is just straight-up bad very bad news last night Dan was in a pretty bad accident he's he's fine not life-threatening and he broke his shoulder I've spoken to him he called me last night to tell me even though he can't move his arms he still wants to smack it I don't know what that means so he's okay but it's still bad he was hurt [Music] I'm not gonna be uploading tomorrow I've had a crash dan I told you not to ride my skateboards when it rains out because you're gonna break them and because it's

jump out of the way of the car but then I slipped and I went and I was heading for it's wheel and then I pushed my arm up against the side and that's what it when it snapped and the car just like drove off and then somebody else called the M you know there's lots of people standing around yeah then I was in the hospital most of last night and so now I have to wait because obviously if if I

approximately equal size international usage forbids the display of the flag of one nation above of another nation in time peace I have no idea what's that title for like the United States clearly has

remember that time you call me which is the most offensive the most you just kind of spread positivity you try to make it harder for my poor hard way so when NASA first started sending astronauts into space they realized that the ballpoint pen would not work at zero gravity a million dollar investment in two years of test result in a pen that could ride in space upside down on almost any surface and at temperatures ranging from below bottle and when confronted with the same problem the Russians used a pencil in the early is a space like those Russians and Americans use pencils in space and fortunately pencil that is made of graphite a highly conductive material snap reflect light sand particles in zero-gravity are hugely problematic as they will get sucked into the air ventilation or electronic equipment easily causing shorts or fires and a few oxygen environment of the capsule after the phone this is a radius thing ever I do think it's interesting though yeah I love when people just call that kind of thing out NASA is not that stupid right it's freaking NASA there's been several studies that show that nASA has made way more money than was invested into it really things that have been invented from it baby formula came from NASA what's baby for babies why are they showing a computer mice okay they invented them right what let's do so NASA make the mouse oh my god the

While youtube flags content inappropriate for young audiences by requiring viewers to sign in, a lot of youtube content is generally unaudited if the uploader of the video does not flag it so. Also there is no distinction between which content is appropriate for what age groups. We will classify content based the film rating system: G, PG, PG-13 and R. We will also apply a binary classification for classifying clickbait videos."
