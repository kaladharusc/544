so many cameras and cameramen and it's

59
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,650
the exact opposite of a production of a

60
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:39,139
vlog where it's just like me one camera

61

appreciate you and now a very special

66
00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:00,109
tech review Tuesday this tech review

67
00:04:00,109 --> 00:04:03,530
Tuesday is more about service than a

68
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:15,260
product you can rent these little

69
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,479
scooters it's kind of like uber for

70
00:04:17,479 --> 00:04:18,949
scooters you like get the app you push

71
00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:20,900
the button and then you just find one of

72
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,639
these things and jump on love it here

73
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:35,090
come here here's exactly how these

74
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:37,040
scooter services work

75
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:44,460
[Music]

76
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,810
first you download the app and it's just

77
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:48,250
like the uber app or anything else yeah

78
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,260
putting your credit card number and some

79
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,270
other oh they have you scan the front

80
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,920
and back of your driver's license which

81
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,390
I don't know kind of creeped me out but

82
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,770
I guess I understand why it's necessary

83
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:58,480
then once you jump through all those

84
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,070
hoops you open the app and there's like

85
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:03,540
a little QR scanner and you have to scan

86
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,100
right here how do you stand it the

87
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,600
scooter like beeps or whatever you get

88
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,010
on and then you have an electric scooter

89
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:10,150
for as long as you want

90
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,860
- scooter companies here ones called

91
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,740
bird and ones called line this one's a

92
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,140
line scooter what's the difference

93
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:23,440
between a lines for the one it's faster

94
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,860
straight up faster birds or slowest like

95
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,650
birds are pretty much is like the bird I

96
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:31,420
just mean my dad just gone on it's

97
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:34,570
pretty cool though I'd say yeah it says

98
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:37,030
your line s electric scooters require

99
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:39,460
one dollar to a lock and they charge you

100
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,770
by the minute as you ride rates and

101
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:43,150
promotions may vary across different

102
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:44,590
rates so that doesn't tell me how much

103
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:46,900
of all right so I don't know exactly how

104
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,370
much these things cost I couldn't find

105
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:49,930
that information online but what I read

106
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:52,420
is it's like about five bucks every half

107
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,340
an hour it just depends so they charge

108
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,350
you by the minute and the rates are

109
00:05:56,350 --> 00:06:33,160
fluctuating five bucks you know what do

110
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,790
you think I'm in awesome really good

111
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:39,210
they're everywhere you use them often in

112
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:41,440
like fourth time using em I use them in

113
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,290
San Diego like yesterday are you

114
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:47,400
drifting your scooter

115
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,830
[Music]

116
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:51,680
it's not really a nice garage to boot

117
00:06:51,680 --> 00:07:08,389
the board all right so my my final

118
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:10,310
thoughts on the scooter situation this

119
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:12,020
is for both the lime scooters and the

120
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,970
bird scooters I'm of two schools of

121
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:16,220
thought here one is that for somebody

122
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,139
who needs transport to get around

123
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:20,840
they're amazing you just jump on you go

124
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,840
they get you there but for everyone else

125
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,090
who's not using the scooters they kind

126
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:29,449
of make the city a like a messier place

127
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,219
to be they're not pleasant the whole

128
00:07:31,219 --> 00:07:33,229
idea seems very half-baked it's a

129
00:07:33,229 --> 00:07:35,270
half-baked because yes great way to get

130
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,580
people around it's part absolute chaos

131
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,650
because like the aspect of where you

132
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:41,960
keep these things and how to not get

133
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,270
them in everyone's way and just myriad

134
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,430
other sort of logistical parts feels

135
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:48,949
totally like no consideration but

136
00:07:48,949 --> 00:07:51,199
ultimately I think they're good because

137
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,110
I use them and I I think there are very

138
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:55,849
interesting glimpse into a future where

139
00:07:55,849 --> 00:07:58,430
like it's not required where there's

140
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:00,110
like a shared transport that doesn't

141
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:02,569
require a car or a bus and it's awesome

142
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:05,120
it's awesome hey max what do you think

143
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,000
of the like bird scooters and the lime

144
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,479
scooters scooters in general I think

145
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:13,909
there are menace to society and they

146
00:08:13,909 --> 00:08:16,580
need to be stopped at all Carly no I

147
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,620
mean I get what's cool about them but

148
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,539
like as someone who lives around here

149
00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:22,490
there's so many times we're like I'm

150
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:24,590
just walking out of a store or like my

151
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:26,210
dog is running out of a store and a

152
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:29,330
scooter like almost runs him over or me

153
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:32,029
and like they're just tourists who have

154
00:08:32,029 --> 00:08:33,829
no idea what the hell they're doing here

155
00:08:33,829 --> 00:08:35,899
and they're like they're veering off the

156
00:08:35,899 --> 00:08:37,339
path they're going the wrong way down

157
00:08:37,339 --> 00:08:39,620
the bike path I mean it's just it's it's

158
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,990
a mess it's a mess it's dangerous

159
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,909
someone's gonna lose an eye and it's all

160
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:44,970
gonna be over

161
00:08:44,970 --> 00:09:06,629
[Music]

162
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:09,699
all right so we spent the last 30 or 40

163
00:09:09,699 --> 00:09:11,199
minutes I don't know if I should have

164
00:09:11,199 --> 00:09:12,310
been doing this or I'm gonna get in

165
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:13,689
trouble for doing this but I was sharing

166
00:09:13,689 --> 00:09:15,790
with max the rough cuts of the Shawn

167
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:18,040
Mendes documentary so he gave me some

168
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,810
meaningful feedback because it's still a

169
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:20,949
work in progress

170
00:09:20,949 --> 00:09:23,139
all right broadly what are your thoughts

171
00:09:23,139 --> 00:09:27,279
I think that this is the best video I've

172
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,730
ever seen case you made are you saying

173
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:31,750
let me say that a different way okay

174
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:35,050
okay this is are you both know I think

175
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:38,860
that this is really fantastic this is

176
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:41,949
really great I almost like it more than

177
00:09:41,949 --> 00:09:44,290
the adventure and the surprise in South

178
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:46,480
Africa that's one of my greatest that

179
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,480
that one that one gets me but this this

180
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,509
is real solid man I can't reach it job

181
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:54,339
it's not me it's it's Zach and Brett and

182
00:09:54,339 --> 00:09:56,470
me it's the teamwork but thanks for the

183
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,420
feet I got to go I got to go back to New

184
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:08,300
York now by Maxie
