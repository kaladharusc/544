tech review Tuesday this is a sponsored

20
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:11,520
tech review Tuesday which means it's not

21
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,680
a real review it's more like first

22
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,190

23
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,020
something here that was just announced

24
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,570
this morning I think I'm the first

25
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:23,070
person to have it maybe they did this

26
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:24,870
with other youtubers too but I'm very

27
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:25,710
excited about

28
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,710
remember Segway Segway has a totally new

29
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,140
Segway coming out that apparently fits

30
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:37,710
in this box and they seventh one they

31
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:39,480
didn't just send me one dude I just

32
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,310
thought I was gonna be foaming today no

33
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,770
no this one's for you pause it dude

34
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,930
looks like a helmet do you wear it on

35
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:48,150
your head they did send me like their

36
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,000
promotional video

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,130
[Music]

38
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:54,780
[Applause]

39
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,940
all I was able to deduce from that

40
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,409
promotional video is that these are

41
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:00,990
little mini segways that go under each

42
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:09,270
foot that you ride like rollerskates you

43
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:21,480
got this well let me see if I can get

44
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,500
over this hump yep let's see if I can

45
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:51,690
get on the hallway okay alright so

46
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,790
looking at the hardware this thing say

47
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:56,880
it's like not much bigger than an actual

48
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,970
shoe it's heavy it feels dense I don't

49
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,920
know six or seven pounds how many pounds

50
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,890
you think this thing weighs three

51
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:07,709
kilograms it's got two little handles on

52
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:09,180
the bottom the wheel is not like a

53
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,680
hoverboard wheel it doesn't have air in

54
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,420
it so it's solid they charge right here

55
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,310
the regular charger the charger does

56
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:16,230
have a double dongle so you can charge

57
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,540
both at the same time and that's kind of

58
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,980
it there's one button here that turns it

59
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,290
on I don't think this tables level but

60
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:33,130
it does balance by it this will be

61
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:41,440
a real-world test of the Segway can

62
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,940
handle these streets but it's definitely

63
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:46,360
not as fun there's like a perfectly

64
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,410
smooth like indoor I think these things

65
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:52,570
would be amazing in an airport or

66
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,080
something like that

67
00:03:54,080 --> 00:04:01,920

72
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:32,940
floor in New York City I was like a

73

plainclothes policeman very polite

74
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,780

Celia having these in my backpack or

82
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:07,460

83
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,810
pretty used to no look

84
