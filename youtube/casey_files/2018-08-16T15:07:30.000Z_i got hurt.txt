what's the verdict with this whole thing

88
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,710
the whole your broken shoulder and

89
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:46,830
basically it's it's a fracture on the

90
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,660
top of the shoulder so like when the

91
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,390
joint pulls out when it dislocates the

92
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,760
circuits like so quickly that it takes a

93
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,270
piece of poetry so there's a loose piece

94
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,100
of bone at the top but if I I don't need

95
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,390
