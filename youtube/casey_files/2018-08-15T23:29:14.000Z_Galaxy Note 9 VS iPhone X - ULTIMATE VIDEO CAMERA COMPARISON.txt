today is a special episode of tech

17
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:45,410
review Tuesday today's episode I'm going

18
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:47,600
to be comparing the video recording

19
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,350
capabilities of the iPhone X versus the

20
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:54,170
Samsung the yet unreleased Samsung

21
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:58,269
Galaxy Note 9 using my custom camera

22
00:00:58,269 --> 00:01:01,370
comparison rig this entire video is

23
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:04,250
being shot in glorious 4k including this

24
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,350
shot right here I'll be shooting both of

25
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:08,420
these cameras in 4k as well so if you

26
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,490
want to switch at the bottom here over

27
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:13,250
to 4k go ahead and do that right now

28
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:14,899
okay the first scenario we're gonna be

29
00:01:14,899 --> 00:01:17,420
testing these phones cameras in is right

30
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:20,840
here in my studio ready alright so this

31
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,420
shot right now was shot on the Samsung

32
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,539
Note 9 and this shot here was shot on

33
00:01:26,539 --> 00:01:30,680
the Apple iPhone X so we may tap on the

34
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,150
screen to set focus or something like

35
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:33,860
that but beyond that both of these

36
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,920
cameras are shooting at 4k 30 frames per

37
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,619
second and in full auto we're not using

38
00:01:39,619 --> 00:01:41,720
the manual features on either of these

39
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,500
phones

40
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:57,490

42
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:02,870
test I'm gonna do some moving shots on

43
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,340
the skateboard so you can see what the

44
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,530
optical image stabilization looks like

45
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:08,690
