1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:10,429
so this is not like a regular episode

2
00:00:10,429 --> 00:00:13,440
this is more like me sharing a story

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,420
with you that I want to share with you

4
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,240
it's not that it's like sad sad but it's

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,970
not a super happy or fun story I just

6
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,439
wanted to give you forewarning if you're

7
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:26,130
expecting like a fun jubilant blog just

8
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,349
come back tomorrow but if you want to

9
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:30,269
hear this more kind of sentimental I

10
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:33,270
guess a little bit a little bit sad of

11
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:34,770
the story well then you're in the right

12
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,770
place but this does start out fun it

13
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,629
starts out being a fun episode so here

14
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:41,940
okay so this was like a week ago this is

15
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:54,329
before Dan left for South Africa

16
00:00:54,329 --> 00:01:03,090

17
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:06,119

00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:07,979

19
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:16,500

21
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:30,060
days so today is a road trip day I've

22
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,509
got a very very long like what is it

23
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:37,110
six-hour leave six hour and 32 minute

24
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,509
drive from New York City up to Vermont

25
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:41,520
where my grandmother is not funeral

26
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,280
funeral is instead of a funeral she's

27
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,869
having the whole family get together to

28
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:47,429
celebrate her life and there's gonna be

29
00:01:47,429 --> 00:01:50,580
like 30 or 40 of us there so I'm sad but

30
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,159
I'm also very excited to see my family

31
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,649
when I'm not excited about is this dry

32
00:01:54,649 --> 00:01:56,880
it's kind of a bummer that Franny and

33
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,800
Candice didn't come I understand why

34
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,940
they didn't want to sit in the car for

35
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:03,000
seven hours it was smart Candice's it's

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,819
too pregnant way too pregnant to be in

37
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:07,860
the car and then nobody I didn't have

38
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,110
anybody else to go with me so today is a

39
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:14,220
day of solidarity focused in and sitting

40
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,170
in my car

41
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:25,350
watching it drive me to Vermont

42
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:31,990
there it is so now I've got about 40

43
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:35,770
half an hour 40 minutes to kill the

44
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:42,379
shopping mall

45
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:44,790
actually I'm buying a tie for the

46
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,769
funeral I'd neglected to bring one so

47
00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:55,520
this is fortuitous stop

48
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:59,030
[Music]

49
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:03,130
quick bite to eat now I think the car is

50
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:07,430
probably close to charge I'm back in the

51
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,320
car getting it washed I got a full tank

52
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,290
of battery I've got I had a food I'm

53
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:15,950
good I'm ready to drop is awesome I'm

54
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:18,350
ready to drive there is one tiny little

55
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:21,500
concern though it is way way further

56
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,630
than I thought I mean not like a little

57
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:26,720
bit for the like significantly as in

58
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,640
it's 9 o'clock at night

59
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,800
I've been driving with traffic like six

60
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,570
hours I'm not even halfway there long

61
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:35,150
story long I got a long long night of

62
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:37,840
driving ahead of me

63
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:45,010
[Music]

64
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:49,160
that was kind of all I shot of the whole

65
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,560
weekend of getting there see I got to

66
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,150
the hotel where my family my whole

67
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,010
extended family was staying we got there

68
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:57,140
like 1:00 in the morning I saw my sister

69
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:00,350
we shared a room and I just I decided at

70
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:02,900
that moment that I wanted this trip to

71
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,420
be just like purely about being present

72
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,860
and being around my family

73
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:09,260
it felt especially relevant because we

74
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,580
were there to sort of celebrate the life

75
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:14,090
of my grandmother but I just I didn't

76
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,610
pick the camera up again until I left

77
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:24,080
[Music]

78
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,480
that's my sister there

79
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:32,430
that's me and my sister so the reason

80
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,750
why I wanted to make this video or just

81
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,130
what I kind of wanted to share for

82
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:40,680
posterity was my take away from this

83
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,750
whole from the whole funeral from the

84
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,150
whole family get together see we woke up

85
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,800
the next morning if we went to the

86
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,680
cemetery in the whole sad part and then

87
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,440
and then that night we had this is the

88
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,910
night of the funeral we had this big

89
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:56,940
like dinner get together in a room it's

90
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,440
sort of like a wedding reception is what

91
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,840
it felt like and after we all finished

92
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,560
our lasagna one after another my aunts

93
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,600
and my uncles and my cousins they all

94
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,070
kind of started to stand up and tell

95
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:14,070
stories about my grandmother that's my

96
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:16,050

life

101
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,040
and so many your stories shared from my

102
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,470
aunts and uncles were directly from that

103
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:33,270

104
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:37,080

116
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,780
my mom always talked to us about how

117
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,820
they had powdered milk when they were

118
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,590
kids because they couldn't afford like

119
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,780
regular milk that comes in a jug they

120
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,190
would buy powder and mix it with water

121
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:19,550
and that was the milk that they got

122

[Music]

123
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:28,760
then my aunt started reading off journal

124
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,370
entries and there was a couple that were

125
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:32,630
short and there's a couple that were

126
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:35,650
like I went to bed hungry tonight

127
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:39,290
because we all the kids ate because we

128
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:41,570
only had enough food for the kids or

129
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:43,690
there was one that was something like

130
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:47,360
feeling terrible I didn't have enough

131
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,360
food for Lee that was her husband my

132
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,310
grandfather maybe tomorrow will be

133
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:54,770
different there were there were a lot of

134
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:57,710
those kinds of moments that just painted

135
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:02,690
such a vivid portrait of what of what my

136
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,760
grandmother's life was like like raising

137
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,010
eight kids and it's hard for me to

138
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,540
imagine this whatever was 50 years ago

139
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:13,430
60 years ago but it just that night

140
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:15,260
there would the family made it so real

141
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:18,950
and so palpable I don't know it's weird

142
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,420
I was felt more affected by my

143
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:22,880
grandmother than in those moments that I

144
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,190
did in my whole life of knowing her and

145
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:29,660
physically being around her

didn't have a fun anecdote from my

grandmother's life but when I stood up I

162

just wanted to thank her and acknowledge

how special of a thing it was that her

the last thing she did on earth before
