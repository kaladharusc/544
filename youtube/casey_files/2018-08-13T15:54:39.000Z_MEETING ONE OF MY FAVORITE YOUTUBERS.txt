come with me coz Jacqueline has a

18
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:32,470
fantastic YouTube channel called nothing

19
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:37,479
but tech 88 yes and how old are you - 16

20
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:38,950
she's 16 years old

21
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:40,479
and I think that I think your channel is

22
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,909
great its tech reviews but I also think

23
00:01:42,909 --> 00:01:45,640
you represent a really underserved place

24
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,250
on YouTube which is like a female

25
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:51,549
perspective on technology iJustine does

26
00:01:51,549 --> 00:01:53,229
a great job in that space but she kind

27
00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:56,200
of stands alone yeah there's not a lot

28
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,459
