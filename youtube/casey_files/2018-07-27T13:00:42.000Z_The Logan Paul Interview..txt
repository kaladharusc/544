1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,929
I want to give a tiny a bit of context

2
00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:06,899
to this interview I want to explain why

3
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:08,910
did this interview and and how this

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:12,330
interview came to be Logan Paul has had

5
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,519
an outsized impact on the YouTube

6
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:17,670
community his actions affect the entire

7
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,850
community and while this is true of all

8
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:24,240
big creators Logan Paul in in general

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,410
and the size of his audience have

10
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:31,019
amplified the consequences of his bad

11
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:35,100
decisions there was a sense of shame and

12
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,710
embarrassment around a lot of the

13
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,780
YouTube community after the suicide

14
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,809
forest video and and all the the fallout

15
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:44,670
from the negative press because of the

16
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:47,940
suicide forest video and in the

17
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,190
aftermath of that Logan did some

18
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,110
interviews and Logan released some

19
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:55,079
videos explaining himself but I know

20
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:57,149
that I was left with a lot of questions

21
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:00,149
questions about his intent and why he

22
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:02,489
did what he did and you know he still

23
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:05,150
has this enormous audience on YouTube

24
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:07,320
what are his plans what are his

25
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,650
intentions moving forward so a couple of

26
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,720
weeks ago when he contacted me about a

27
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,540
documentary he's currently making about

28
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,210
his life on YouTube I obviously had a

29
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:20,280
lot of questions but I told him that I

30
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,890
would be willing to do the interview for

31
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,320
his documentary provided he'd be willing

32
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,740
to come here and sit with me so I could

33
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:33,270
interview him on my channel and to his

34
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,490
credit to Logan's credit he agreed and

35
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:36,780
he agreed that nothing would be

36
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,960
off-limits and he also encouraged me to

37
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,200
challenge him he he he wanted it to be

38
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,920
an honest and hard interview so those

39
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,420
are the circumstances surrounding it

40
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,970
that's how it came to be and it's now

41
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:52,500
been a full week since I did the

42
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:57,860
interview and to be totally honest I

43
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:00,180
wasn't sure I'm still not sure if

44
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,149
releasing it is the right thing I I

45
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:06,210
Harbor a lot of self-doubt about maybe I

46
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,459
was too easy on him I mean maybe I was

47
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:12,819
too argumentative with him

48
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:15,040
the things I hope to learn my very

49
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,840
specific intention with this interview

50
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,780
was to see if he was sincere about what

51
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,100
he's trying to accomplish with this

52
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,840
documentary or if the whole thing is

53
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:27,010
just a charade for good PR and now I

54
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:28,990
feel like watching this interview over

55
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:32,110
and over and over I still I don't know I

56
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,000
there's a little bit of me that thinks

57
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,420
maybe I'm enabling Logan he and I have

58
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,830
known each other for years we've always

59
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:41,500
been friendly and by putting this on my

60
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:45,420
channel am I now part of the machine to

61
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,830
rehabilitate his image it's not what I

62
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:49,870
want to do that is not my intention but

63
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,910
could this be viewed as that I I don't

64
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:58,300
know so I hope that this interview will

65
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,459
help the community better understand why

66
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:02,650
he did the really stupid things that he

67
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:05,019
did and if he's now truthful and sincere

68
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:06,970
about wanting to have a positive impact

69
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:10,750
on the platform the platform that he and

70
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,570
his really stupid really terrible

71
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:16,420
decisions and actions did so much damage

72
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:23,049
to so I'm I'm really seeing and this

73
00:03:23,049 --> 00:03:25,180
video is not monetized this video is

74
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:29,079
also not edited this is the entire 30

75
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:31,720
minute conversation that I had with

76
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:37,599
Logan Paul one week ago

77
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,640
so let me start I just want to ask what

78
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,420
is this documentary yeah so I mentioned

79
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,890
in one of my vlogs and there's been a

80
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:48,530
lot of speculation on what people think

81
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,239
it is the doc is not a it's not a

82
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,190
documentary about how dang hard my life

83
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,290
has been this year it's about the story

84
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:57,500
of a young man from Ohio a seemingly

85
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,489
regular kid being me of course falling

86
00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:04,190
into the social medium machine over the

87
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:06,670
past four years building an audience

88
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:10,310
garnering false power through views

89
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,959
which equates to money which equates to

90
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:14,690
against success and then essentially

91
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:18,709
losing it all overnight becoming the

92
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:22,580
most hated man in the world in the snap

93
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:25,610
of a finger so the question that the doc

94
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:27,950
answer is how do you recover from that

95
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:31,220
can you recover from that me sitting you

96
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,910
with you right now

97
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:37,070
I'm in the journey right now with you

98
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:40,090
like will is it possible for Logan Paul

99
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:43,240
to make a comeback or am I going to be a

100
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,789
failed youtuber and fall and crawl into

101
00:04:46,789 --> 00:04:49,610
a hole like half the world wants me to

102
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:54,020
do is you know just ask directly

103
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,030
is this a fluff piece to make people

104
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:58,580
feel better about Logan Paul no no not

105
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:02,990
at all this it's it's from making

106
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:05,810
content throughout the years I try to be

107
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:08,330
as unbiased as possible and when you say

108
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:10,789
fluff piece like what because like a

109
00:05:10,789 --> 00:05:12,770
 video it's just like look ride

110
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,750
that you should feel bad here's a way to

111
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,880
characterize it is the video about how

112
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,860
you've learned to better empathize with

113
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,010
others or is the video about making it

114
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:23,840
easier for people to sympathize with you

115
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,190
um I don't I don't think people should

116
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:30,950
can or will sympathize with me let's be

117
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:35,000
honest Casey like what I did it there's

118
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,130
no distracting people there's no well

119
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:43,280
here's what I tried to do and this is

120
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,810
why it's okay there's none of that

121
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:49,180
it's an unbiased objective story

122
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:55,050
that captures how something like that

123
00:05:55,050 --> 00:06:00,539
can happen and what what went wrong in

124
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:05,259
my life that I thought that was a good

125
00:06:05,259 --> 00:06:08,440
idea because at the end of the day I'm

126
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,789
the one who has to look in the mirror

127
00:06:09,789 --> 00:06:12,910
and say that was my decision and that's

128
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:14,460
that's a hard thing to do is even like

129
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,660
hard talking about it right now with you

130
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:20,050
because up until that point in my life I

131
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:22,539
I it was really only winds it was only

132
00:06:22,539 --> 00:06:27,220
success it was only consistent growth

133
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:31,300
and and everything was going so well and

134
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:38,410
I got so caught up with my actions being

135
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:41,729
validated by millions of people I forgot

136
00:06:41,729 --> 00:06:44,020
to be a human being in that situation

137
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:46,840
and instead decided to be a content

138
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,789
creator and that's where I messed up do

139
00:06:51,789 --> 00:06:52,770
you

140
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:55,389
it's are even in there there's a little

141
00:06:55,389 --> 00:06:57,460
even in that response there was like

142
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,409
maybe I'm being cynical but there's a

143
00:06:59,409 --> 00:07:02,650
little whiff of it sounding like you see

144
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:06,460
yourself in some capacity as a victim no

145
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,979
I know by no means am I the victim here

146
00:07:08,979 --> 00:07:11,470
and I guess it's it's sort of tough

147
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:13,090
because I want to make it very clear I

148
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:16,120
am I am not the victim here by no means

149
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:20,650
and everything I say I do need to not

150
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:22,479
word it like that because I'm I'm not

151
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,490
the victim what I'm not afraid to do

152
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:28,889
though is be vulnerable about this and

153
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:32,530
open up and say by no means by no means

154
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:37,330
I know what I did was disgusting it was

155
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:41,080
it was wrong it was an extreme obviously

156
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:44,169
lapse in judgment like I've said but by

157
00:07:44,169 --> 00:07:46,180
no means am I am I the victim or

158
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,909
claiming to be the victim do you would

159
00:07:48,909 --> 00:07:50,620
you characterize this is a redemption

160
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,070
story

161
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:54,099
it's an attempted redemption story is

162
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:55,570
what it is that's it are we still

163
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:57,370
talking about the doc yeah I mean that's

164
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:00,580
what it is that's what like again

165
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:05,530
will I come back I say yes that's what

166
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:07,419
this what the doc is about the story is

167
00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:10,740
is it not how long has it been since the

168
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,949
yeah

169
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:16,479
is it not is it not premature like it

170
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:17,949
before you can tell a redemption story

171
00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:21,599
there has to be an act of redemption

172
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,879
true so what is that what is that what

173
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,159
is the act of redemption bin for Logan

174
00:08:27,159 --> 00:08:29,770
Paul it's it's not been done yet that's

175
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:32,529
what the doc is about and like again

176
00:08:32,529 --> 00:08:36,640
this whole the whole idea of the harlot

177
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,450
is crazy fine the whole the whole idea

178
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:42,789
of the doc is like we don't have plans

179
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,620
for it we don't plan on like profiting

180
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:47,110
off it if if we if we are gonna monetize

181
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:51,790
it if I don't know I don't know cuz what

182
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,920
we want to do I've told stories my whole

183
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,959
life through a lens as have you so the

184
00:08:55,959 --> 00:08:58,720
thought process is why why'd let someone

185
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,089
else make that story cuz someone's gonna

186
00:09:01,089 --> 00:09:02,440
want to make that story people have

187
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,940
wanted to make that sort why let someone

188
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,260
else do it when I could just do it

189
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:08,649
myself and I know that if we do decide

190
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:11,110
to monetize it 100% of the proceeds will

191
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,399
go to some sort of suicide prevention

192
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,959
awareness program because that's that's

193
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:17,920
essentially what this whole thing is

194
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,990
about are you are you a different person

195
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:26,200
now than you were yeah absolutely

196
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,839
oh let me follow it up by because I've

197
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:31,680
heard you say that how have you

198
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,720
demonstrated that how have you not just

199
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,920
said but what have you done to

200
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,690
demonstrate that and are you even

201
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,940
sharper in saying that like a lot of

202
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,740
your content

203
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,839
I think the suicide video that you came

204
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,240
out with your first video back no really

205
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,190
demonstrated what your channel is

206
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:49,750
capable of and talking about something

207
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:53,230
bigger than just Logan Paul but there

208
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,790
hasn't been much since then there hasn't

209
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:56,290
been much that's demonstrated you're a

210
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:57,370
different person you talk about

211
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:59,440
positivity and being a different person

212
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,820
and changing the structure of the

213
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,680
channel and then it was days later

214
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,649
you're shooting a dead mouse so what

215
00:10:05,649 --> 00:10:07,779
what had you done to demonstrate you

216
00:10:07,779 --> 00:10:10,529
changed as a person the rat

217
00:10:10,529 --> 00:10:14,549
the rat was right yeah the rat was that

218
00:10:14,549 --> 00:10:17,729
was me becoming obsessed with the idea

219
00:10:17,729 --> 00:10:21,899
of being a villain when when the whole

220
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:26,129
world hates you I just I made the

221
00:10:26,129 --> 00:10:28,319
conscious decision I'm gonna I'm gonna

222
00:10:28,319 --> 00:10:29,789
be the guy they think I am

223
00:10:29,789 --> 00:10:34,229
and I essentially became the architect

224
00:10:34,229 --> 00:10:35,639
of my own destruction

225
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:37,949
because I wanted to be who they thought

226
00:10:37,949 --> 00:10:39,689
I thought I might as well adopt this

227
00:10:39,689 --> 00:10:42,629
adopt this screw it and it wasn't that a

228
00:10:42,629 --> 00:10:44,429
direct contradiction to everything you

229
00:10:44,429 --> 00:10:45,809
just put out about how you're changing

230
00:10:45,809 --> 00:10:47,539
and how you're a different person

231
00:10:47,539 --> 00:10:51,029
yeah videos we're inside of a week yeah

232
00:10:51,029 --> 00:10:53,629
I know but it to me

233
00:10:53,629 --> 00:10:56,939
while I can still be a good person I'm

234
00:10:56,939 --> 00:11:02,039
also still was possibly am the guy who

235
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:04,469
takes things to extremes that's I mean

236
00:11:04,469 --> 00:11:07,049
that's that's who I am that's the brand

237
00:11:07,049 --> 00:11:10,109
of Logan Paul it's the fastest the

238
00:11:10,109 --> 00:11:15,959
biggest the best the greatest and but

239
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:17,909
and it's not that led you to the I mean

240
00:11:17,909 --> 00:11:19,259
that's how you started this exactly I

241
00:11:19,259 --> 00:11:21,479
mean that's that's everything is to the

242
00:11:21,479 --> 00:11:24,119
extreme right so if I can make content

243
00:11:24,119 --> 00:11:27,239
and I have been for four years for four

244
00:11:27,239 --> 00:11:28,739
years making people laugh smile

245
00:11:28,739 --> 00:11:30,929
believing themselves making them believe

246
00:11:30,929 --> 00:11:32,309
that they can accomplish their goals

247
00:11:32,309 --> 00:11:33,569
even if they're from a small town in

248
00:11:33,569 --> 00:11:39,239
Ohio because I made these mistakes yes

249
00:11:39,239 --> 00:11:42,569
I'm going to demonstrate more empathy

250
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:45,389
and more compassion but at the same time

251
00:11:45,389 --> 00:11:49,199
I still have my brand and what saw thing

252
00:11:49,199 --> 00:11:53,579
to me is that brand of living life on

253
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:58,619
the edge do you understand I I do but I

254
00:11:58,619 --> 00:12:01,139
think it's sort of a convenient umbrella

255
00:12:01,139 --> 00:12:03,929
to hold over everything so I think it

256
00:12:03,929 --> 00:12:05,549
it's Noble when you talk about

257
00:12:05,549 --> 00:12:07,349
motivating people I think it's it's I

258
00:12:07,349 --> 00:12:08,609
think it's a noble ambition to want to

259
00:12:08,609 --> 00:12:10,589
inspire and motivate people especially

260
00:12:10,589 --> 00:12:12,509
someone like how you characterize

261
00:12:12,509 --> 00:12:14,669
yourself and coming from being a normal

262
00:12:14,669 --> 00:12:17,969
guy yeah but I think that like to use

263
00:12:17,969 --> 00:12:21,509
that same to use that same pretext as

264
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:23,300
sort of justification

265
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:26,450
for you know killing a rat or well I

266
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:29,899
didn't kill the rat those circumstances

267
00:12:29,899 --> 00:12:31,430
around that video or some of the other

268
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:33,140
more controversial sensational things

269
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:35,300
you've done running around Japan wearing

270
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,339
silly outfits yeah so that Union

271
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:39,920
sensitive to culture that's all part of

272
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:45,920
the same I want to address this cuz I'm

273
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,420
not gonna lie this is the the hardest

274
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:50,540
thing about all this is I think being

275
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:53,959
perceived as culturally insensitive as

276
00:12:53,959 --> 00:12:57,019
far as the outfits go they were on sale

277
00:12:57,019 --> 00:12:59,390
at a store right next to the temple that

278
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:02,570
we were at for tourists do we not buy

279
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:04,370
the outfits don't know if they're on

280
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:07,670
sale there and then deeper I mean that's

281
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,890
we could dive into the specifics of what

282
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:11,779
happened there's a difference between

283
00:13:11,779 --> 00:13:15,100
culturally insensitive and insensitive

284
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,800
the brand that I was at the time was

285
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,740
just all-around insensitive and that's

286
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:26,779
the person who I am no longer trying to

287
00:13:26,779 --> 00:13:31,430
become and will no longer represent on

288
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:35,870
the vlogs yeah and you think that that

289
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,970
has been the case with your content

290
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:40,640
since that moment till now there's this

291
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,390
looking ahead this okay so it's it's

292
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:46,820
this is looking ahead yes but because

293
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,500
you're right it's like I said those

294
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,050
things and then you go and taser that

295
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:52,610
rat what the what happen

296
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:54,170
did you just contradict everything and

297
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:56,360
the answer is again like you said yes

298
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,329
that's why it's hard for me because how

299
00:13:59,329 --> 00:14:01,339
many times can you say one thing and

300
00:14:01,339 --> 00:14:05,089
then try to be a better person but truly

301
00:14:05,089 --> 00:14:10,520
now it's like I'm vegan now I got a

302
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:14,510
girlfriend who is extremely wise and she

303
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:16,250
helps me grow and become the person I

304
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:20,630
want to become my content is focused

305
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:27,620
more on positivity and doing what you

306
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,360
want to do to achieve your goals which

307
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,790
is all like I said it's always been that

308
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:34,640
but all that stuff is overlooked when

309
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,420
you make mistake or why

310
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,980
sensationalism clouds that it's like a

311
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:41,620
an eclipse if if that mission which

312
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,690
again I do think is noble but wanting to

313
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:45,009
motivate I don't I don't even want to

314
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,990
say it but when a moon comes in front of

315
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:48,509
it and that moon is a moon of

316
00:14:48,509 --> 00:14:52,720
sensationalism that is harmful it clouds

317
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,910
out a completely black Wow what's what's

318
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:59,050
harmful I mean I think like the general

319
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:01,149
sort of disrespectfulness that comes

320
00:15:01,149 --> 00:15:03,100
along with that kind of some true I

321
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,990
think that certainly everything that

322
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:06,639
sort of precipitated the suicide forest

323
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,490
incident or I think that the you know

324
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:11,379
like the the tasing of the rat and

325
00:15:11,379 --> 00:15:14,019
myriad other just kind of the general

326
00:15:14,019 --> 00:15:15,910
attitude that you characterize is living

327
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:16,360
on the edge

328
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:20,259
I think really clouds a lot of that much

329
00:15:20,259 --> 00:15:23,139
more a much more meaningful in addition

330
00:15:23,139 --> 00:15:25,810
of wanting to inspire true but I think

331
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:27,100
this is a good dovetail for a bigger

332
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,649
question that's that's that you and I

333
00:15:29,649 --> 00:15:32,290
both identify with which isn't like the

334
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:34,779
pressure of being a youtuber of being a

335
00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:37,209
daily vlogger of uploading every single

336
00:15:37,209 --> 00:15:38,680
day of having to maintain that audience

337
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,019
get more views so you can get paid to

338
00:15:41,019 --> 00:15:43,810
keep it going the focus on relevancy

339
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:45,399
that focus on the biggest Channel today

340
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:47,889
the most subscribers say like there are

341
00:15:47,889 --> 00:15:49,750
pressures that come along with that

342
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:52,630
where you get this tunnel it's tunnel

343
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:54,069
vision yet and that's why you know in

344
00:15:54,069 --> 00:15:56,410
2016 I stopped logging I remember you

345
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:57,910
you text me the day I stopped vlog

346
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:00,130
because I felt like I went to a place

347
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:02,949
where I was so caught up in that that I

348
00:16:02,949 --> 00:16:05,170
was full of well I was gonna ask

349
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:09,189
you one question I have use have you

350
00:16:09,189 --> 00:16:12,310
ever found yourself in a place where you

351
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:13,990
are being influenced by your success

352
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:16,389
rather than your creativity and did that

353
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:18,250
lead to your demise because that's what

354
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:21,490
happened to me I would probably push

355
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:23,559
back at the idea that had a demise but

356
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:26,769
certainly it contributed to my not one I

357
00:16:26,769 --> 00:16:28,689
did two daily vlog I stopped an Aston

358
00:16:28,689 --> 00:16:30,160
stuff like why am I doing this and I was

359
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,529
caught up in that tidal wave and that

360
00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:34,180
sounds like I don't wanna do it

361
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,009
anymore and it's now my work is much

362
00:16:36,009 --> 00:16:37,750
more about creative motivation it's much

363
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,129
less about like I don't care about use

364
00:16:39,129 --> 00:16:40,809
fighting for Elephants he doesn't make

365
00:16:40,809 --> 00:16:43,180
sense I don't care about that but I do

366
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:45,580
want to back up so I ask this question

367
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,529
because I want to understand where your

368
00:16:47,529 --> 00:16:50,500
head was before you went into that

369
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,360
forest I don't want to beat that dead

370
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,830
horse you've said a lot about that

371
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:56,019
you've been open about that but I do

372
00:16:56,019 --> 00:16:57,700
want to understand like where was your

373
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,130
brain leading where was the thought

374
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:03,850
process leading up into that I talking

375
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:08,079
about the day of like you were riding

376
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,390
away that I I think no one in the

377
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:12,579
history of YouTube had ever been on that

378
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:14,620
they haven't that's why when I wanted to

379
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:15,699
take you there

380
00:17:15,699 --> 00:17:20,640
when I sit here and say that every day

381
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,400
we were creating a new piece of content

382
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,760
meant to bend the limit push it right up

383
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,820
to the edge be entertaining be funny be

384
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:34,809
positive spread a message we got so

385
00:17:34,809 --> 00:17:39,460
caught up in creating that we did not

386
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,800
stop to think about what we were making

387
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,890
and whether or not it was right because

388
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:47,290
it you make it you put it out we were on

389
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:49,750
autopilot essentially which is it's it's

390
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:50,890
extremely dangerous when you're

391
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:52,660
broadcasting to an audience of five to

392
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:55,929
seven million people every day and so

393
00:17:55,929 --> 00:17:57,669
there was no thinking there was it was

394
00:17:57,669 --> 00:18:00,010
create content create content create

395
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:02,980
content not okay hey take a step back

396
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,890
slow down breathe so the time I would be

397
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:07,720
a human being that meet this mission of

398
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,870
wanting to inspire and motivate like do

399
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:13,000
you believe that or is that

400
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,610
because if that's if that mission is the

401
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:17,620
same as this this momentum this

402
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,750
autopilot where's the distinction

403
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:22,059
between wanting to do good and wanting

404
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,830
to you know looking for sensationalism

405
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:25,809
that will drive clicks I'm not I'm not

406
00:18:25,809 --> 00:18:26,860
sure I understand the question

407
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:30,220
I also do want to say I'm not well-liked

408
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,260
while the underlying mission is always

409
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:34,000
that you can you should you achieve it's

410
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,360
okay to be different

411
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,370
it's I'm not that's not what my channel

412
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:41,679
is entirely about it's a combination of

413
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,750
that and it is entertainment it's a

414
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,340
light-hearted comedy essentially that's

415
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:48,640
what it is I just think those two things

416
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,669
in conflict with one another essentially

417
00:18:51,669 --> 00:18:53,380
yeah and that's why I'm a brand that's

418
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,300
that's who Logan Paul is because I do

419
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,720
bridge the gap between being like a

420
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,260
motivational speaker

421
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,570
kids and standing on a stage in front of

422
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:04,270
300 people but also like hey I am a

423
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:07,750
 kid I'm 23 years old 22 years

424
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,270
old at the time and if I want to go jump

425
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:12,280
out of a plane naked I'm gonna

426
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,460
do it but at the same time you can work

427
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:18,280
hard and achieve your anybody ever want

428
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,540
to do anything anybody ever faulted

429
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:20,800
Logan Paul for jumping out of a plane

430
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,750
naked no that's all I'm saying but I

431
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:25,480
could give you a list of like I jumped

432
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,600
off a bridge into the river in Italy

433
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,270
is that culturally insensitive is saying

434
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,590
Mamma Mia in Italy culturally

435
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:34,330
insensitive I don't I would argue that

436
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:36,520
it's just insensible but jumping on the

437
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,350
hood of a car in Japan is and culturally

438
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:40,480
it is yeah

439
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,370
jumping on the hood of a car in Japan is

440
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:44,020
culturally insensitive dressed as a

441
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:46,120
pokemons throwing a Pikachu at the car I

442
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,620
I absolutely think why do you think

443
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,000
that's insensitive well I mean

444
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,950
culturally culturally insensitive

445
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:54,010
I think that's insensitive but the fact

446
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:55,810
that it's being pinpointed to be

447
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:58,300
culturally insensitive when I do that

448
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:01,660
 did did that everywhere that's

449
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,430
hard for me that's hard for me to hear

450
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:05,200
and listen to I mean

451
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,060
without getting into too much nuance

452
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:09,160
you're the culture of Pokemon is very

453
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,370
much woven into the culture of Japanese

454
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:15,490
culture yeah you were dressed up as a

455
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:19,150
character from a Japanese pop cult you

456
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:20,500
were dressed as a Japanese pop culture

457
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,740
sort of icon as Pikachu so like I do

458
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,270
think that there is a connection there

459
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:28,030
well but Kasey they sell the outfits in

460
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:30,460
Japan I understand I understand that do

461
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:31,210
you Casey

462
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:33,040
cuz I saw I don't know I don't agree

463
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,650
with you but I I don't agree with me I

464
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:36,550
want to make that clear

465
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:38,830
I don't I don't agree with me or think

466
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:40,480
what I did was right I'm just saying

467
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,980
there's a difference between being

468
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:45,280
culturally insensitive insensitive

469
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,160
towards a culture and overall

470
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,410
insensitivity which is what the old

471
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:53,170
Logan Paul had an issue with and had a

472
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:55,480
problem with and is now today what I'm

473
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,970
working to not do ever again I just

474
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:00,700
think you were both of those things okay

475
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,100
okay but let me ask you took a month off

476
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:06,790
yeah and talking about that autopilot

477
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:07,280
that

478
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,350
mentum and I get that dude I was been

479
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:13,010
have been there how did that month off

480
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:16,610
help you empathize and understand both

481
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,140
the criticism coming at you which was

482
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:20,870
like insane never seen anything like it

483
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:23,690
yeah and then how did that like what did

484
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:33,950
you learn in that month off so during

485
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:37,280
the month off it was a lot of meeting

486
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,900
talking to visiting Ashley came to New

487
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,890
York for a couple days

488
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:41,480
suicide prevention organizations

489
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:45,400
organizations about mental health and

490
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,990
finding out what it what it truly is

491
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:51,650
like to have suffered from depression or

492
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:52,880
know someone with depression or even

493
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,690
know someone that has died by suicide

494
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:59,150
because that ain't it's just it's just

495
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:02,390
bad cuz this that's crazy Rose New York

496
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:04,460
sorry the sirens here at the office are

497
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:06,410
just unbearable um this is what I had

498
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:09,470
that mother up there okay are you so you

499
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:11,180
can see when they're passing dude I mean

500
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,290
I have hours of footage of me just

501
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:14,440
cursing the world um

502
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,510
but continue you tell you you did you

503
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:19,070
invested time in meeting with people

504
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:21,230
yeah and to this day to this day the guy

505
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:23,990
who is uh in my suicide be here tomorrow

506
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:25,880
video at Kevin Hines I text him every

507
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,900
single day and we we want to do

508
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,610
something together in the in the future

509
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:33,230
obviously I'm focused on this fight

510
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:36,190
right now that's my number one mission

511
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:44,090
but the month off was a step for me to

512
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:46,670
once again become a human being and

513
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:48,770
forget about views money success and

514
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:51,290
clout and it was a chance for Logan Paul

515
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:54,140
to be like okay this this this is why

516
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,520
this is wrong because I had never been

517
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,170
like I said in the video affected my

518
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:59,180
suicide I don't know I didn't I didn't

519
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:01,030
know

520
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:04,150
what it what it means to know some are

521
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:06,790
loose someone who has died by suicide so

522
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:09,190
it was an attempt for me to discover

523
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:10,570
that and once again like I said a

524
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:13,000
million times right now become an actual

525
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,800
human being and after after that video

526
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:18,910
dropped I guess it's like did did did he

527
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:20,980
give you an appreciation for the cuz

528
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,630
that video I think had a very important

529
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:24,400
message behind it was a I like that

530
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,720
video I tweeted that I liked that video

531
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:29,110
and I'm gonna get for it but did it show

532
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:31,330
you sort of the demonstrate to you that

533
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:33,250
your channel is capable of so much more

534
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:34,810
and your reach is capable and your voice

535
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:36,550
is capable of so much more than just

536
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:40,180
sensationalism views yes but I mean but

537
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,620
I I don't want to say I didn't know that

538
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:44,950
I just was doing the wrong thing with

539
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:47,710
with that capability I was I wasn't

540
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:51,010
putting out PSAs like that it's it's the

541
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:55,120
most viewed suus anti-suicide PSA ever

542
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,830
and it was groundbreaking for me to

543
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:01,690
realize it's it is possible for me to

544
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,610
create a piece of content that can

545
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:07,690
change that many lives I will say what

546
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:10,390
we did in that video was the attempt

547
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:13,810
with the forest video beginning middle

548
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:19,080
and end I made it very clear that it is

549
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:22,720
okay to feel ostracized and alone what's

550
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,580
not okay is holding those feelings in

551
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:26,770
and that I truly believe quote-unquote

552
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:29,350
that every person has a place on this on

553
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:32,740
this earth but we did that in such the

554
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,990
wrong way we tried to shock it into

555
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:37,180
people versus showing and demonstrating

556
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:40,140
it's my telling and hard to believe that

557
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:43,180
that's what the suicide forest video was

558
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,590
about when you guys are laughing and

559
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:46,270
smiling and just the thing that bothered

560
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:47,260
me the most about the video was your

561
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:50,620
excitement exercise you were excited to

562
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:55,090
have found a dead body not not really

563
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:56,950
this is oh this is this is what I

564
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:58,720
watched it that was the emotion that I

565
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,180
was that I that I took you from you and

566
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:03,400
your Posse you guys felt like we've got

567
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,780
something here that's going to get us

568
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:06,040
views at the beginning of the video is

569
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,990
like something you've never seen on

570
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:10,690
YouTube before that is what affected me

571
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:12,230
the most about that video

572
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:14,450
because I understand that mission and I

573
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:16,580
do think your your suicide video really

574
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:19,700
accomplished that but if you're gonna

575
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,380
conflate the two then I just have to I

576
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,909
have to tell you why I don't I don't I

577
00:25:22,909 --> 00:25:24,909
don't agree with that complaint okay

578
00:25:24,909 --> 00:25:28,010
okay let's let's I want to hear about I

579
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:29,000
want to talk about the fight

580
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,559
what what is the fight you're fighting

581
00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:36,049
ksi sorry dude it's just it is brothers

582
00:25:36,049 --> 00:25:37,429
fight you don't want to move on you

583
00:25:37,429 --> 00:25:38,659
dream or you want to know just because

584
00:25:38,659 --> 00:25:45,769
yeah the laughing is it's a defense

585
00:25:45,769 --> 00:25:47,269
mechanism for me that's what it is

586
00:25:47,269 --> 00:25:50,960
absurd you say that do you believe it um

587
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,950
I believe it when you're saying it but I

588
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:57,380
don't believe that you expect people the

589
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,000
eight million people that saw it video

590
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,470
for say you know to understand within

591
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:02,090
those contexts that you were just

592
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:04,669
laughing at as a defense mechanism like

593
00:26:04,669 --> 00:26:07,000
I think that there's there's intent and

594
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,860
and then there's there's actuality and

595
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,840
there's a saying it's like the the road

596
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,330
to hell is paved in intent because if

597
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:16,159
all that really matters is what

598
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,350
transpired and what transpired is you

599
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:20,570
and your your peers your friends

600
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:24,139
laughing and snickering and and making

601
00:26:24,139 --> 00:26:26,659
light of a human being who had died and

602
00:26:26,659 --> 00:26:30,409
I think that your intent in that moment

603
00:26:30,409 --> 00:26:32,600
is irrelevant all I see is

604
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:37,240
what's actually transpiring

605
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:40,210
I tried to move on from this and talking

606
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:41,860
about the Box English man I just like I

607
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:44,890
know I just understand it's it's hard

608
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:47,350
for me to listen to someone to my face

609
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:51,940
tell me that I was laughing at the guy

610
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:54,550
I'm telling you how I hired a nurse in

611
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:56,740
my perspective I understand I just I've

612
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,660
met unique no you're not you're not

613
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,400
unique you you do represent the voice of

614
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:06,340
the people which is what I'm learning to

615
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:10,590
I guess be vulnerable about I just like

616
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:14,920
it was never my intent to come off like

617
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,590
I was laughing or joking about Seuss I

618
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:19,660
said suicide it's not a joke three times

619
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,940
in the video because it's it's clearly

620
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:26,590
not it I never thought it was I just

621
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:30,580
used comedy when I'm uncomfortable or I

622
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,710
don't know what to do when there's a

623
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:34,840
lens on me and my actions are

624
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:37,390
essentially being validated by five to

625
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:39,640
seven million people and no one around

626
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,040
around me is telling me hey that's not

627
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:42,580
okay

628
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:45,750
I understand that I understand I just

629
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:49,240
excuses never validate yeah truth truth

630
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,130
and your answers may be valid but it

631
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:53,080
doesn't excuse the action does not at

632
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:58,410
all and I'm like I said ashamed

633
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:02,730
deplorable mistake and the only thing

634
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:06,820
that I want to do right now is show that

635
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:11,260
that video was not a representation of

636
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:16,330
Who I am who I will become and who I

637
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:21,190
want to be I appreciate that

638
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:23,230
we talked about the plate now yeah sure

639
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:24,340
we can talk about these well because

640
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:25,930
he's turned off after 30 minutes keeping

641
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:31,180
an eye on them what is what is your

642
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:34,090
fighting que si what is the true what is

643
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:35,950
the fight i'ma beat his ass I'm a big

644
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:38,410
boxer I've been boxing for like 12 years

645
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:40,270
I don't like to step into the ring

646
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:42,130
because I don't want to get hit I value

647
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:44,380
my brain too much but just if all I had

648
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,700
to rely on was his face love and I

649
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,470
wouldn't go very far I need the brain

650
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:49,370
okay okay what is this

651
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:52,720
um why is this happen that's essentially

652
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,100
ksi he called me out he called my

653
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:58,309
brother out and I accepted the fight I'm

654
00:28:58,309 --> 00:28:59,780
always up for a challenge I thought

655
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:03,290
honestly for me having that event happen

656
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:05,900
in January this was a way to step back

657
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,059
from the world of YouTube and stop

658
00:29:08,059 --> 00:29:09,140
worrying about the views the money the

659
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:11,780
clout all that went down I haven't

660
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,730
grown on Instagram in six months

661
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:18,770
literally at all and focus my efforts on

662
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:21,050
something else so I can become a

663
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:23,559
different guy this is like the boxing

664
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:27,620
win for me is showing people that even

665
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,270
if you fail even if you get knocked to

666
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:30,559
the ground even if if you feel like

667
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:31,910
you're at the lowest point of your life

668
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:34,700
you can get up and do something and

669
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:41,240
still win do you think that the fight is

670
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,550
part of the redemption story do you see

671
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:44,660
the finest part yeah yeah absolutely

672
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:47,300
absolutely because it's it's not about a

673
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:51,050
fight it's not about the boxing match

674
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:53,179
itself like I said it's about being able

675
00:29:53,179 --> 00:29:56,120
to get hit in the face whether they're a

676
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,250
result of your own actions or not in my

677
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:01,179
case they are I'm the one who up

678
00:30:01,179 --> 00:30:04,700
but I'm willing to say ok this is the

679
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,480
mistake I made

680
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,059
I'm gonna keep my chin up I'm gonna keep

681
00:30:08,059 --> 00:30:09,830
moving forward no matter how many people

682
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:11,200
want me to crawl in a hole and die

683
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:16,130
forever I'm not gonna do that you can

684
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:19,010
fail and still come back and still keep

685
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:24,580
on going and still win so you're Jake's

686
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:27,980
Deji ksi they've been cranking out

687
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:30,340
content every day yeah it's like

688
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:31,880
trash-talking I've seen them at the

689
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,740
press conference is just being vicious

690
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:36,860
they've just been non-stop and with

691
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,870
exceptions it feels like you've been a

692
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:43,880
little bit more reserved yeah including

693
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,530
like the press conference in in London

694
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:49,730
where after ksi just really got gnarly

695
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:53,420
with his you know with his with his

696
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,400
verbal exchange like he went to a really

697
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,610
crazy place you just

698
00:30:57,610 --> 00:31:01,270
got up and walked out is this is this

699
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:03,880
you being like frustrated or is this

700
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:07,420
part of the new Logan Paul it's the new

701
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:10,500
Logan Paul it's I have no interest in

702
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,760
bantering back and forth with someone

703
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:15,850
who is the exact person that I'm trying

704
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:19,320
not to become and stay away from by

705
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:24,010
degrading woman by going after my family

706
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:29,530
in a in in a manner that is intended to

707
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:32,470
harm he's I don't I don't have any

708
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:35,200
interest in that the goal for me here is

709
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,740
to beat him on August 25th not talk

710
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:41,170
about how I'm gonna beat him not talk

711
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:44,350
about his family or talk about what I'm

712
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:47,590
gonna do to his girlfriend the goal is

713
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:51,100
to win a fight and I just I was over it

714
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,480
like I as soon as I walked in the press

715
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,690
conference I was like okay this I'm just

716
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:58,180
over the top Casey to be honest it's all

717
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:00,940
it's all Fugazi Fugazi this time to

718
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:04,860
fight this fight words right there um

719
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:09,700
all right and then I I guess like a big

720
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:13,810
question I have for you is like I don't

721
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:16,420
know how to say it up there's a lot of

722
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:18,610
like a lot of YouTube community was

723
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:21,310
upset after a lot of you know the

724
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:23,170
negativity around Logan Paul because

725
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:25,570
they thought you sort of besmirched what

726
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:27,400
it meant to be a youtuber Yeah right

727
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,130
rightfully so I guess it's like what do

728
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:31,480
you say to that how do you respond to

729
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:35,110
that huh is there a response for that um

730
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:38,370
I mean to my fellow creators like

731
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:40,480
wholeheartedly I mean I apologized

732
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,980
already but I am sorry that I I guess

733
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:47,620
brought shame upon the platform is if

734
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:48,940
that's how I want to word it that's why

735
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,230
I say I guess is why I have to be so

736
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:52,480
careful we're like how I talk but that's

737
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,500
that's obviously not the person who I

738
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:58,780
want to become or live in the body Oh

739
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:01,570
for the rest of my life and just like I

740
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:05,500
made a mistake I promise I will do the

741
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:08,650
community well and keep my head up and

742
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:10,179
keep on trucking in

743
00:33:10,179 --> 00:33:13,240
ring light to YouTube but obviously

744
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,700
Casey it's it's horrible to see your

745
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:19,149
peers sure and rightfully so because of

746
00:33:19,149 --> 00:33:21,850
my own actions like I just felt bad

747
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:24,159
again I apologize for it I'll apologize

748
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:25,629
for it a thousand times I don't want to

749
00:33:25,629 --> 00:33:26,919
sit here and be a sob story for the rest

750
00:33:26,919 --> 00:33:30,159
of my life so so then and and this will

751
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:34,210
I want to end it with this but I want to

752
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:36,399
ask what's next for Logan Paul but I

753
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:38,759
want to ask within the context of like

754
00:33:38,759 --> 00:33:42,940
understanding your resume now has some

755
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:45,940
some some dirty marks on it understand

756
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,710
that you you carry this bag it's and

757
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:50,379
there's no getting rid of it where do

758
00:33:50,379 --> 00:33:51,730
you go from here in the world of me

759
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:53,080
what's your where does where do you want

760
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,249
to be in ten years and how are you

761
00:33:54,249 --> 00:33:56,019
accomplish that having to lug around

762
00:33:56,019 --> 00:33:59,590
these you know these chains forever

763
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:06,789
I think Hollywood I think America in

764
00:34:06,789 --> 00:34:10,720
general is it's they love Redemption

765
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,839
stories they it's it's a story for me my

766
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:16,839
life is now a story about someone who

767
00:34:16,839 --> 00:34:20,770
was winning someone who self imploded

768
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:23,889
and was like I said the architect of

769
00:34:23,889 --> 00:34:28,950
their own destruction and struggle and

770
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:33,639
vulnerability and now it's being able to

771
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:36,819
say this is a part of my life and I want

772
00:34:36,819 --> 00:34:39,460
to become better I don't want to let my

773
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:41,440
mistakes to find me I think a person is

774
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,819
defined by how they recover from their

775
00:34:42,819 --> 00:34:44,859
mistakes and what's next for me is

776
00:34:44,859 --> 00:34:47,220
honestly probably just content creation

777
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:50,409
businesses I can answer this question

778
00:34:50,409 --> 00:34:52,750
with a hundred things but all that

779
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:53,829
 matters to me right now is to

780
00:34:53,829 --> 00:34:55,990
