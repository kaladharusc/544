52
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:12,200
I am typically not an emotional person

53
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,960
but this news makes me want to cry a

54
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,020
little bit I found this out last night

55
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:21,560
for the first time in my whole life

56
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:26,150
I am now an uncle yesterday there was a

57
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:30,200

58

59
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:37,490
doing great and it's very exciting

60
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:39,350
that's been like this little dopamine

61
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:41,240
thing in my brain all day that's just

62
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,780
like happiness happiness happiness

63
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:46,490
number two and I don't know how to feel

64
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:49,010
about this I guess I'm like okay I

65
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:51,050
shared with you like a week ago or two

66
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:53,810
weeks ago about my grandmother passing

67
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:57,080
away which is really just sad and a real

68
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,930
bummer but this weekend instead of a

69
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:02,540
regular traditional funeral the entire

70
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,520
family the extended family is getting

71
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,580
together up in New England like six

72
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,070
hours from New York City I feel okay

73
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:12,910
about it because while it's very sad it

74
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:15,740
her not being here is very sad and her

75
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,989
passing was very sad but the act of

76
00:04:17,989 --> 00:04:20,630
celebrating it as a big family is very

77
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,250
positive and I do feel good about that

78
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,680
so that's number three this is just

79
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:29,390
straight-up bad very bad news last night

85
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,340
can't move his arms he still wants to

86
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,080
smack it I don't know what that means so

87
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,940

boosted board in the rain that's exactly

112
00:06:16,739 --> 00:06:18,959
what I said it and then I was like I was

113
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:21,599
thinking like how many times have I done

114
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:25,079
this you know and I was going along and

115
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:27,839
then I I was pushing it full force like

116
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:31,019
I was just headed home you know it was

117
00:06:31,019 --> 00:06:34,319
pouring rain like a thunderstorm okay

118
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,639
continue and I I was hitting in the bike

119
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,549
lane and then his black car just pulled

120
00:06:41,549 --> 00:06:43,649
out of no it's just like it just came

121
00:06:43,649 --> 00:06:47,309
out into the bike lane and then I

122
00:06:47,309 --> 00:06:50,129
slammed on brakes but obviously like it

123
00:06:50,129 --> 00:06:52,439
was wet so but like I slammed and brake

124
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:54,209
side like it

125
00:06:54,209 --> 00:06:56,399
it was sliding towards the car and I was

126
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:58,439
thinking like oh my I'm gonna hit into

127
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:00,689
the car so I tried to jump out of the

128
00:07:00,689 --> 00:07:02,369
way of the car but then I slipped and I

129
00:07:02,369 --> 00:07:04,229
went and I was heading for it's wheel

130
00:07:04,229 --> 00:07:07,439
and then I pushed my arm up against the

131
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:09,029
side and that's what it when it snapped

132
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:11,729
and the car just like drove off and then

133
00:07:11,729 --> 00:07:13,499
somebody else called the M you know

134
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:14,879
