10
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,730

11
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,189
can see 58 is actually blocked off at

12
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:34,860
ninth Avenue NYPD officers SWAT teams

13
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,260
state police all here on scene working

14
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,360
to contain the situation there was a

15
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,960
bomb discovered this morning at the CN n

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,879
offices which is in the Time Warner

17
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,280
building in midtown here in New York

18
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,879
City important detail no one was injured

19
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,489
the NYPD great job bomb squad great job

20
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:55,949
happy to hear that a lot of my former

21
00:00:55,949 --> 00:01:06,890
colleagues and and friends are at CNN so

22
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:10,979
you can hear me was also and to turn on

23
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:12,689
the TV all the news channels they're

24
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:18,020
running this story just over and over

25
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:21,600
and then if you look at news online like

26
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,060
this is the New York Times on Fox talks

27
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,750
about a bomb CNN even on BBC which is a

28
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,360
more of a global news source top item

29
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,810
there is about an explosive and an

30
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,280
explosive being sent to New York City

31
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,780
and pretty usual they talked about the

32
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,250
resilience of New Yorkers that it's

33
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,380
still business as usual here in the city

34
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,740
of New York so I want to make a little

35
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,310
video that's what this is showing you

36
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:48,720
you know people at home people watch

37
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,700
this YouTube channel from all around the

38
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,009
country and all around the world to show

39
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:55,740
you what it's like actually to be here

40
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,860
in New York City as a denizen of the

41
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,259
city as someone who lives here you look

42
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:03,180
at it on TV it feels like that the whole

43
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,619
city's standing still and everything's

44
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:06,630
stopped because of this like really

45
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,550
terrible incident but what's it actually

46
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:11,069
like here I want to make very clear that

47
00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:12,330
the people in New York City

48
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:15,030
will not be intimidated that we are

49
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:18,530
going to go about our lives undeterred

50
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:22,050
because the very concept of terrorism is

51
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:24,060
to change us and we will not allow that

52
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:44,340
to happen this is Manhattan now my

53
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,530
studio my office is down here in

54
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:49,140

55
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:52,680
place in midtown here right at 59th

59
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:02,520
notification on my like service alert

60
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,470
thing was that there was like a thing

61
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:07,200

63
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:11,280
have you noticed anything like different

64
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,109
in the city because of that incident no

65
00:03:16,109 --> 00:03:18,420

but it was kind of like whatever because

69
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,810

[Music]

73
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,170
you cannot be terrorized if you refuse

74
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:51,980
to allow the terrorists to win people

75
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:55,280
the city have shown time and again that

76
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,040
they stand up in the face of these

77
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:02,480
efforts to intimidate

78
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,130
do you know where happened this morning

79
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:06,720
I like

80
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,540
I live around there and I got at work

81
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,570

82
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:19,079
sure there was like type

83
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,849

84
00:04:20,849 --> 00:04:22,289

85
00:04:22,289 --> 00:04:24,150

86
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:26,220
is anything any changes would people

87
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:29,220
the city at large when something like

88
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,710
that takes place well being new newly

89
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:35,880
moved here and when I found that out in

90
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,940
the workplace I saw a shift and

91
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,650
everyone's

92
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:42,050
demeanor I think it put everyone in a

93
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:44,720
really sick to their belly feeling and

94
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,400
it scared me especially as someone

95
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:53,610
that's new to the

96
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:56,639
this is 53rd and 7th this is about six

97
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,770
block seven blocks from where the

98
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:00,240
incident took place this morning

99
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,219
I wouldn't know who looking around that

100
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:04,139
anything that today's different from any

101
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:06,780
other day here in here in midtown

102
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:20,520
Manhattan open a block closer so I'm

103
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,409
gonna get a little closer and see what I

104
00:05:22,409 --> 00:05:24,479
can see there is an increased police

105
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,460
presence here but I'm like a block away

106
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,349
from the Time Warner building oh yeah

107
00:05:28,349 --> 00:05:30,840
have you noticed anything different in

108
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,099
the city today because of what happened

109
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:32,629
this morning

110
00:05:32,629 --> 00:05:35,580
um well there's a lot of police and like

111
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:38,639
a lot of like you know what happened no

112
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,610
there was an explosive device found and

113
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:42,689
that's my mobility

114
00:05:42,689 --> 00:05:46,169
oh my god with a block there it's really

115
00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:47,729
important at a moment like this to

116
00:05:47,729 --> 00:05:51,270
remember the vast majority of Americans

117
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:53,849
the vast majority of New Yorkers are

118
00:05:53,849 --> 00:05:56,669
good people trying to live in peace with

119
00:05:56,669 --> 00:05:57,230
each other

120
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:02,550
[Music]

121
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:05,110
what I heard they say something like

122
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:07,300
some bomb triggers like my dad when

123
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,860
something like this happens do you

124
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,720
notice any difference in the way the

125
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,680
city operates people is gonna be this

126
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,780
typical New York response would just be

127
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,850
I'm late for work

128
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:21,040
my boss doesn't care we have to get to

129
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:35,050
work or we have to get where to happen

130
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:39,850
this morning and even this close to it I

131
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:41,020
talked to a lot of people walking by and

132
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:43,120
there's two schools of thought I know

133
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,340
what happened and I don't care I've got

134
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,710
to live my life and I don't know what

135
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:50,020
happened and I don't care I have to live

136
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,690
my life it's the reality it's the world

137
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:54,100
that we live in so people just gonna

138
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,440
keep going on people gonna be vigilant

139
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,140
but you know we're gonna be vigilant but

140
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,790
everyone's gonna keep going you know

141
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:04,890
doesn't stop in the office

142
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:13,840
[Music]

143
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,730
on the news and it feels like a huge

144
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:19,580
global event it is and this isn't to

145
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,110
undercut the significance of what

146
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:24,200
happened but to really underscore the

147
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,790
resilience of people in New York City

148
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:28,730
the city just keeps going no matter what

149
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:30,440
happens are the reason why I love it

150
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,070
here so much what they are trying to do

151
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:39,200
is scare us and destabilize us and we

152
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,840
will not allow that to happen we are New

153
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,130
Yorkers we are smart we are tough we are

154
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:51,010
resilient and we will not allow these

155
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:56,600
terrorist bugs to change the way we live

156
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:13,000
our lives
