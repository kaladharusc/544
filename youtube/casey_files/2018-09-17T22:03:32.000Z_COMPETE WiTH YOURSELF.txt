we

62
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,490
you know I almost didn't run today

63
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:03,930
because what a pain in the ass coming

64
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:06,599
all the way to Philadelphia is but but

65
00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:08,610
I'm glad I did and when I was out there

66
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:11,189
is reminded of what makes running such a

67
00:05:11,189 --> 00:05:14,250
special sport in racing such a great

68
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:17,400
part of that sport see I wanted to run a

69
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,729
130 today and I ran a 128 which means I

70
00:05:20,729 --> 00:05:23,610
did it I won and that that's the magic

71
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:26,099
of running races that you're only ever

72
00:05:26,099 --> 00:05:28,560
competing with yourself all that matters

73
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,509
is that how did you do how did your

74
00:05:30,509 --> 00:05:33,330
results compare with your goals well as

75
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:35,939
your time I don't know like 210 what is

76
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:39,930
your goal on 210 all right yep yep can I

77
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:43,349
yeah so the whole time I'm running that

78
00:05:43,349 --> 00:05:46,349
race whether I'm like passing some dude

79
00:05:46,349 --> 00:05:47,279
or this grill

80
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:49,050
burning by me I'm just looking at all

81
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,419
these people and I'm thinking to myself

82
00:05:50,419 --> 00:05:54,210
champions they're all champions so if

83
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:55,830
you've ever considered running or ever

84
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:58,169
considered racing know that no one gives

85
00:05:58,169 --> 00:06:00,689
us how you fare compared to everybody

86
00:06:00,689 --> 00:06:03,240
else all that really matters is how did

87
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,759
you do compared to what you wanted to do

88
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,469
so that feels for me that's that's a

89
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:11,210
special thing

90
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:18,190
[Music]

91
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:21,530
don't you
