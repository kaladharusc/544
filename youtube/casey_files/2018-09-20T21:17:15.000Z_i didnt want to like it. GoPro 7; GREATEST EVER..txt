GoPro we've ever made and it's the

27
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,500
biggest leap forward and performance

28
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,990
since the original HD hero back in 2009

29
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,880
High Definition was the first thing that

30
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,619
put GoPro on the map and hyper smooth is

31
00:02:00,619 --> 00:02:06,420
today this is the gimbal killer so we're

32
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,920
all about helping people capture their

33
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,440
active lifestyles and with activity

00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,750
comes motion and with motion generally

35
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,190
comes shake this thing captures the best

36
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:21,240
stabilized video of any camera

37
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,830

38
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:28,900

all right so this is gonna be the GoPro

47
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,460
downhill tests all I'm gonna do both

48
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,830
stabilize and then unstabilized and I'll

49
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:17,590
try to show you like side-by-side but I

50
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:18,820
got to turn this camera off because I

51
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,770
can't actually ride with this camera

52
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:40,470
this recording to do that

53
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:54,710
[Music]

54
00:03:54,710 --> 00:04:13,020
[Music]

55
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,700
do you think that youtubers can vlog

56
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:19,239
with the hero 7 yeah I don't I uh

57
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:20,739
personally I don't understand why you

58
00:04:20,739 --> 00:04:22,750
guys are still using these massive

59
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:26,770
cameras when we've made this badass like

60
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:29,440
self capture solution I get it for

61
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,680
certain application sort of but yeah you

62
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,020
can absolutely vlog with this thing man

63
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:37,390
we've improved the audio performance so

64
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:39,669
increase the dynamic range you get more

65
00:04:39,669 --> 00:04:42,940
natural voices and you don't have to be

66
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,290
lugging or I mean look at the size of

67
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:47,260
this thing dude by the way to the

68
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:50,320
waterpark this is Jeremy what's up guys

69
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,950
Jeremy was a u.s. army green beret

70
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:57,220
Special Forces they say that right yeah

71
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,410
you're correct and now is product

72
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:00,430
marketing at GoPro how'd you go from

73
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,350
Special Forces to product marketing of

74
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:05,350
velcro you know I decided to get out of

75
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:07,300
the military and got hooked up with

76
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,220
their product team I actually tested

77
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,919
hero 3 plus for them when I was in the

78
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:17,110
military doing skydives really seriously

79
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:26,320
other wear helmet yeah oh yeah do we go

80
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,600
in the same tube

81
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:37,690
get ready thanks guys

82
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:43,840
[Applause]

83
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,260
Oh God improved audio

84
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:51,010
I think GoPros have never been known for

85
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:54,200
their great audio

86
00:05:54,200 --> 00:06:07,830
[Music]

87
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:10,740
okay how often this thing gets seriously

88
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:17,610
hurt on this slide he can be honest

89
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:49,240
[Music]

90
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,500
yeah that's me

91
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,540
require neck brace in the morning I

92
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,790
think there was a period where a gimbal

93
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,530
was really exciting and people were

94
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,680
psyched on see stabilized footage that

95
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,270
accessible but we've made it even more

96
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:05,690
accessible with hyper smooth rest in

97
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:06,250
peace

98
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:10,130
rest in peace gimbal okay Nick thank you

99
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:13,010
for subjecting yourself to my interviews

100
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:14,750
thanks bro I'm gonna start using this to

101
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,650
vlog with it's way lighter

102
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:37,550
[Music]

103
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:45,890
I went to today knowing I was going to

104
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:48,100
see the new GoPro and I had a lot of

105
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,480
skepticism I just don't see what the

106
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,540
point is in having another GoPro but

107
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,430
after spending the day with the same

108
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:57,200
seeing some of the footage seeing what

109
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,130
it's capable of I get it it won me over

110
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:04,040
I guess the question that needs to be

111
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,770
answered is is this thing worth four

112
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:09,590
hundred dollars and the question I had

113
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:10,580
for Nick and didn't really have a

114
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:13,010
satisfying answer for me was our cell

115
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:15,230
phones now they're waterproof they have

116
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:17,600
4k high resolution super high quality

117
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,000
cameras built into them and if we're

118
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,060
gonna spend money on something good you

119
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,260
know something better than our phones

120
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,090
typically we're gonna target something

121
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:28,310
like this so between the spectrum of a

122
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:31,340
cell phone and an SLR camera where does

123
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:34,070
the GoPro fit in and I don't know I

124
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:35,630
think it's a very I think it's a very

125
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:37,760
tough question if you're professional

126
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,430
filmmaker youtuber like me absolute

127
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:42,020
necessity but if you're someone who has

128
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,940
limited resources in what you can afford

129
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,000
for hardware I don't know that this

130
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,770
would be the first thing you'd spend 400

131
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:50,750
bucks on it is an amazing product it is

132
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,850
by far the best GoPro GoPro has ever

133
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:54,860
released I will continue to use this in

134
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,510
this vlog and now that the embargo has

135
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,720
been lifted I'll actually let you know

136
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,260
when I shoot it on the GoPro ok

137
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:20,000
